# Predicting Research Paper Publishability and Conference Classification Using SciBERT

## Overview
This project leverages SciBERT, a domain-specific pre-trained language model, to classify research papers as publishable or non-publishable (Task 1) and predict the most suitable conferences for publishable papers (Task 2). The solution automates key aspects of academic workflows, enhancing decision-making efficiency.

## Results

- **Task 1: Publishability Classification**
  - Accuracy: **75%**

- **Task 2: Conference Prediction**
  - Accuracy: **92%**

## Features

1. **Publishability Classification**: Fine-tuned SciBERT to predict whether a research paper is publishable or non-publishable.
2. **Conference Prediction**: Identifies the best-suited conference for publishable papers.
3. **Efficient Training Pipeline**: Handles long-text sequences with SciBERT tokenization and dynamic batching.

## Future Work

- Enhance accuracy for publishability classification with advanced augmentation techniques.
- Deploy the model with a user-friendly web interface.
