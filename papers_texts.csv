Introduction
The objective of this research is to develop an innovative algorithm for accurately estimating the
causal effect of treatment on outcomes in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) when latent
confounders are present. Existing methods often struggle in this scenario, typically requiring
multiple proxy variables to account for the unobserved confounding or relying on strong, often
unrealistic, assumptions about the data generating process. These limitations significantly restrict
the applicability of these methods in real-world settings where obtaining multiple reliable proxies
can be challenging or even impossible. Our proposed approach offers a significant advancement by
leveraging a single proxy variable, combined with information extracted from cross-moments of the
observed variables, to identify and estimate causal effects. This reduction in data requirements makes
our method considerably more practical and widely applicable. The algorithm’s robustness to model
misspecification and its ability to handle high-dimensional data are also key features, enhancing its
utility in complex real-world scenarios.
The core innovation lies in the strategic use of cross-moments to capture the intricate relationships
between the observed variables and the latent confounder. By carefully analyzing these relationships,
our algorithm effectively disentangles the direct effect of the treatment from the indirect effect
mediated by the latent confounder. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the causal effect,
even in the presence of significant confounding bias. The theoretical foundations of the algorithm
are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and providing a solid basis for its application. We
demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness through extensive simulations, comparing its performance
against state-of-the-art methods under various conditions, including varying levels of confounding
and noise. These simulations highlight the algorithm’s superior accuracy and robustness.
Furthermore, we showcase the practical applicability of our algorithm through real-world case studies.
These applications demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to provide valuable causal insights in settings
.
where traditional methods fail. The algorithm’s efficiency and scalability make it particularly suitable
for large-scale datasets, a significant advantage in the era of big data. This capability addresses
a critical limitation of many existing causal inference techniques, which often struggle with the
computational demands of large datasets. The potential applications of this algorithm extend to
diverse fields, including healthcare, economics, and social sciences, where understanding causal
relationships is crucial for informed decision-making.
Our work contributes significantly to the field of causal inference by providing a practical and
powerful tool for researchers and practitioners. The algorithm’s ability to handle latent confounders
with a single proxy variable represents a major breakthrough, simplifying the data requirements
for causal inference and broadening its accessibility. This simplification is particularly valuable in
situations where data collection is expensive or limited. The algorithm’s robustness and efficiency
make it a promising candidate for widespread adoption in causal inference applications across various
disciplines. Future work will focus on extending the algorithm to handle non-linear SCMs and
exploring its application in more complex causal inference settings, such as those involving multiple
treatments or mediators. The development of user-friendly software implementing this algorithm is
also a priority to facilitate its wider adoption and use.
In summary, this research presents a novel and efficient algorithm for causal inference in the presence
of latent confounders. Its ability to leverage a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and
scalability, makes it a significant contribution to the field. The algorithm’s theoretical foundation and
empirical validation provide strong evidence of its effectiveness and potential for widespread impact.
We believe this work will stimulate further research into the development of more efficient and robust
causal inference techniques, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable causal inferences in
diverse settings.

Related Work
Our work builds upon a rich body of literature on causal inference with latent confounders. Traditional
approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as the availability of multiple proxy variables [1,
2] or the imposition of restrictive functional forms on the relationships between variables [3]. These
assumptions can be difficult to justify in practice, limiting the applicability of these methods. For
instance, methods based on instrumental variables [4] require the identification of a variable that
affects the treatment but not the outcome directly, a condition that is often hard to satisfy. Similarly,
techniques relying on conditional independence assumptions [5] may be sensitive to violations of
these assumptions, leading to biased estimates. Our approach offers a significant advantage by
relaxing these stringent requirements.
Several recent works have explored the use of proxy variables for handling latent confounding [6,
7]. However, these methods often require multiple proxies, which can be challenging to obtain in
many real-world applications. Furthermore, the performance of these methods can be sensitive to
the quality and number of proxies used. In contrast, our method leverages a single proxy variable,
making it more practical and robust to the limitations of proxy data. The use of cross-moments
to extract additional information from the observed data is a key innovation that distinguishes our
approach from existing methods.
The use of cross-moments in causal inference has been explored in various contexts [8, 9]. However,
these methods often focus on specific model structures or make strong assumptions about the data
generating process. Our approach provides a more general framework that can handle a wider range
of scenarios. The theoretical guarantees we provide offer a solid foundation for the reliability and
validity of our method, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. This rigorous theoretical
analysis distinguishes our work from purely empirical approaches.
Our algorithm also addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data, a common issue in modern
causal inference problems. Many existing methods struggle with the computational complexity
associated with high-dimensional data, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. Our
method’s efficiency and scalability make it particularly well-suited for such scenarios. This scalability
is achieved through the efficient use of cross-moments and the development of computationally
efficient algorithms. This aspect of our work contributes to the growing need for scalable causal
inference techniques.

Finally, our work contributes to the broader goal of developing more robust and reliable causal
inference methods. The ability to accurately estimate causal effects in the presence of latent con-
founders is crucial for many applications, ranging from healthcare to social sciences. Our method’s
ability to handle latent confounders with a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and
scalability, represents a significant advancement in the field. The development of user-friendly
software implementing this algorithm will further enhance its accessibility and impact.

Methodology
Our proposed method leverages a single proxy variable and cross-moments to identify and estimate
causal effects in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with latent confounders. Unlike existing
methods that often require multiple proxy variables or strong assumptions, our approach offers a
more practical and robust solution. The core idea is to exploit the information contained in the
cross-moments of the observed variables to disentangle the direct effect of the treatment from
the indirect effect mediated by the latent confounder. This is achieved by carefully analyzing
the relationships between the observed variables and the single proxy variable, allowing us to
effectively account for the unobserved confounding. The algorithm is designed to be robust to
model misspecification and capable of handling high-dimensional data, making it suitable for a
wide range of real-world applications. The algorithm’s efficiency stems from its ability to directly
utilize cross-moments, avoiding computationally expensive iterative procedures often found in other
methods. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when dealing with large datasets. Furthermore,
the algorithm’s theoretical foundations are rigorously established, providing strong guarantees on
its performance and reliability. The theoretical analysis ensures that the estimated causal effects are
consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. This rigorous theoretical framework
distinguishes our approach from purely empirical methods. The algorithm’s robustness is further
enhanced by its ability to handle noisy data and model misspecification, ensuring reliable results even
in challenging scenarios. The algorithm’s design incorporates techniques to mitigate the impact of
noise and model misspecification, leading to more accurate and stable estimates. The algorithm’s
modular design allows for easy extension and adaptation to different settings.
The algorithm proceeds in three main steps. First, we estimate the cross-moments of the observed
variables, including the treatment, outcome, and proxy variable. These cross-moments capture the
complex relationships between the variables and provide crucial information for identifying the causal
effect. The estimation of these cross-moments is performed using robust statistical techniques that are
resistant to outliers and noise. The choice of estimation method is crucial for ensuring the accuracy
and robustness of the subsequent steps. We employ a method that is both efficient and robust to outliers
and noise, ensuring reliable estimates even in the presence of noisy data. The second step involves
solving a system of equations derived from the estimated cross-moments. This system of equations is
carefully constructed to leverage the information contained in the cross-moments to identify the causal
effect. The solution to this system of equations provides an estimate of the causal effect, accounting
for the latent confounder. The solution is obtained using efficient numerical methods that are designed
to handle potential numerical instabilities. The third step involves constructing confidence intervals
for the estimated causal effect. This step provides a measure of uncertainty associated with the
estimate, allowing for a more complete understanding of the results. The confidence intervals are
constructed using asymptotic theory, providing valid inferences even in large samples. The entire
process is designed to be computationally efficient, allowing for the analysis of large datasets.
The theoretical properties of the algorithm are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and
validity. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild
conditions. These theoretical guarantees provide a strong foundation for the application of the
algorithm in various settings. The consistency result ensures that the estimator converges to the true
causal effect as the sample size increases. The asymptotic normality result allows for the construction
of valid confidence intervals, providing a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate. The
theoretical analysis also provides insights into the algorithm’s robustness to model misspecification
and the impact of noise. The theoretical results are supported by extensive simulations, demonstrating
the algorithm’s superior performance compared to existing methods. The simulations cover a wide
range of scenarios, including varying levels of confounding and noise, demonstrating the algorithm’s
robustness and accuracy. The theoretical analysis and simulation results provide strong evidence of

P115.pdf,"An Examination of Expansive Multimodal Models:
Insights from an Educational Overview
Abstract
This document provides a summary of a presentation centered on extensive multi-
modal models, specifically their development to a level comparable to and poten-
tially exceeding that of multimodal GPT-4. The exploration is divided into three
sections. Initially, the context is established by discussing recent large-scale models
akin to GPT, which are designed for vision and language processing. This sets the
stage for exploring research in large multimodal models (LMMs) that are fine-tuned
with instructions. Subsequently, the foundational aspects of instruction tuning in
large language models are covered, which is a method that is further adapted to
the multimodal domain. The final section demonstrates the creation of a basic
version of multimodal models similar to GPT-4 using publicly available resources.
Additionally, a review of newly developing areas in this field is presented.
1
Introduction
With the widespread integration of advanced language models into modern society, there’s a burgeon-
ing enthusiasm among scholars and scientists to create open-source large language models (LLMs)
and to investigate their growth into large multimodal models (LMMs). This manuscript concentrates
on leveraging LLMs for multimodal applications and training LMMs in a comprehensive manner,
enabling them to process visual data and engage in conversation.
2
Background
2.1
Image-to-Text Generative Models
In their present configuration, LMMs predominantly function as image-to-text generators, accepting
images as input and producing textual content as output. The architectural design of these models
generally includes an image encoder for deriving visual characteristics and a language model for
generating textual sequences. These visual and linguistic components can be interconnected through
an adaptable module. Both the image encoder and the language model have the flexibility to be
developed from the ground up or based on previously trained models.
The training methodology typically involves employing an auto-regressive loss on the generated text
tokens. Within the Transformer framework, image tokens have the capability to interact with one
another, and each text token is influenced by the preceding text tokens and all image tokens.
2.2
Case Studies
We will analyze several established LMMs to demonstrate how the architecture can be actualized
across various models while adhering to the same auto-regressive training principle.
**Case Study I: LMM Trained with Image-Text Pairs**
Many LMMs are developed using extensive collections of image-text pairs. Notable models like Gen-
erative Image-to-Text Transformer (GIT) and Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP2)
.
have set high standards across various datasets. GIT utilizes an image encoder from a contrastive
pre-trained model and builds a language model independently. Conversely, BLIP2 maintains the
pre-trained image and language models in a fixed state while incorporating a trainable Querying
Transformer (Q-former), demonstrating efficiency through a unique bootstrapping technique.
**Case Study II: LMM Trained with Interleaved Image-Text Sequences**
Flamingo serves as an exemplary model in this category, incorporating pre-trained image and language
models with the addition of new integrative components. It includes a Perceiver Sampler to streamline
computational demands and a Gated Transformer to enhance stability during the early training phase.
Flamingo is trained on a diverse mix of large-scale multimodal data sourced exclusively from the web,
bypassing the need for conventionally annotated machine learning datasets. Post-training, Flamingo
can adapt to vision-based tasks through few-shot learning without additional task-specific tuning.
A standout feature of Flamingo is its capability for multimodal in-context learning. When presented
with image-text pairs as a demonstration, Flamingo can generalize to new, unseen tasks, such
as visual math problems, without further training. It successfully interprets the patterns in task
instructions from examples and applies this understanding to new images. Flamingo represents
a significant advancement in multimodal learning, akin to the breakthroughs seen with GPT-3 in
language processing.
2.3
OpenAI Multimodal GPT-4 and Research Gaps
Released in March 2023, OpenAI’s GPT-4 showcases advanced capabilities in understanding and
reasoning with visual data. Although specifics of the model remain undisclosed, its ability to facilitate
new applications is evident from highlighted examples in technical reports. For instance, it can
discern unusual elements within images and demonstrate sophisticated reasoning across text and
images.
The inquiry into constructing models akin to Multimodal GPT-4 leads us to examine OpenAI’s
advanced models, as depicted in Figure 7. Key observations are: (i) GPT-2 serves as the auto-
regressive equivalent in the era dominated by BERT’s pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm. (ii)
GPT-3, a 175-billion parameter model trained on extensive web text, showcases emergent properties
such as in-context learning and chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning without requiring further training.
This model represents a shift from fine-tuning model weights to utilizing prompts for broader
generalization and reduced adaptation costs. (iii) ChatGPT and InstructGPT emphasize the importance
of models following instructions and aligning with human intentions by fine-tuning on high-quality
instruction data and using a reinforcement learning framework. (iv) GPT-4 not only enhances previous
models’ language capabilities but also incorporates visual inputs for comprehension and reasoning.

Pre-requisite: Instruction Tuning in Large Language Models
Instruction-following is a concept that originated in the field of natural language processing (NLP). To
understand this concept more deeply and trace its development, we revisit the practice of instruction
tuning in conjunction with LLMs.
3.1
Instruction Tuning
**Traditional Language Data**
In the realm of natural language processing, the seq2seq format is frequently employed, where
each data point comprises an input sequence and a corresponding output sequence. Typically, task
instructions are implicitly understood rather than explicitly stated. Models trained on this data format
often struggle to adapt to new tasks in a zero-shot manner because they lack the ability to interpret
and generalize task instructions during testing.
**Instruct Language Data**
Recent advancements involve the explicit incorporation of task instructions during model training.
These instructions, often articulated in natural language, lead to a structured format of instruction-
input-output triplets. This enables the training of a single model capable of handling multiple tasks
2
with clear directives. The exposure to varied task instructions and examples during training allows
the model to generalize to novel tasks through task composition during inference.
3.2
Self-Instruct and Open-Source LLMs
The collection of a wide array of high-quality instruction-following data can be achieved through
two primary methods: human-human interaction and human-machine interaction. The former is
resource-intensive, involving human task providers and annotators, while the latter involves machines
or models performing the annotation tasks under human guidance.
Self-Instruct tuning represents a streamlined and potent method for aligning LLMs with human
intent, utilizing instruction-following data produced by leading teacher LLMs. This technique,
which leverages the in-context learning capability of LLMs, has significantly enhanced the zero- and
few-shot generalization abilities of LLMs. The iterative process, as illustrated in Figure 9, involves
humans providing initial examples, which the LLM then uses to generate further instructions and
responses, refining the dataset iteratively.

Instructed Tuned Large Multimodal Models
This section describes the development of a minimal multimodal GPT-4 model using open-source
tools, with a focus on the LLaVA model, and a similar approach in the MiniGPT-4 project.
4.1
Open-Source Prototypes: LLaVA / MiniGPT4
Inspired by successful concepts in NLP, we apply the self-instruct methodology from language
processing to the vision-and-language domain. A significant challenge is the absence of a robust
multimodal teacher model. Thus, we explore how language-only models like GPT-4 can generate
multimodal instruction-following data.
4.1.1
Data Creation
Instead of directly inputting images into OpenAI GPT, symbolic sequence representations are used,
as shown in Figure 12 (a). LLaVA utilizes captions and bounding boxes for several reasons: (1)
GPT-4 is found to comprehend these representations effectively, unlike ChatGPT, which struggles
with bounding box data; (2) these elements are crucial for an informative representation of the image.
As demonstrated in Figure 12 (b), three forms of instruction-following data are used: multi-turn
conversations for interactive user engagement, detailed descriptions for comprehensive response
generation, and complex reasoning to address the implications beyond the image content.
4.1.2
Network Architecture and Training
As shown in Figure 13, LLaVA’s architecture is a specific implementation of the general image-to-text
generative model framework discussed in Section 2 and Figure 3. LLaVA integrates a pre-trained
CLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder with the Vicuna large language model via a projection matrix. The
training process involves two stages:
- **Stage 1: Pre-training for Feature Alignment.** Only the projection matrix is updated using
a portion of the CC3M dataset, focusing solely on image captioning. - **Stage 2: End-to-End
Fine-tuning.** Both the projection matrix and the LLM are fine-tuned to cater to various application
scenarios.
4.1.3
Performance
**Performance on Visual Chat**
When fine-tuned on diverse multimodal instruction-following data, LLaVA demonstrates effectiveness
in user-oriented applications. Empirical evidence suggests that adjusting only the linear projection
layer is adequate for conversational scenarios, although it necessitates longer training periods.
In an evaluation using 30 unseen images, each paired with three types of instructions, LLaVA achieved
an 85.1

**Performance on Science QA**
LLaVA, when fine-tuned on a scientific multimodal reasoning dataset, achieved a 90.92
**Performance on OCR in the Wild**
Despite not being explicitly trained on OCR data, LLaVA exhibits a surprising zero-shot OCR
capability, as illustrated in Figure 16.

How Close Are We to Reaching or Surpassing OpenAI’s Multimodal
GPT-4?
The open-source community has rapidly produced a range of models and prototypes that introduce
a variety of new functionalities. For instance, LLaVA and Mini-GPT4 are leading the way in the
creation of multimodal chatbots, replicating some of the functions described in OpenAI’s GPT-4
technical documentation. Additionally, GILL has broadened the capabilities of LMMs to include
comprehensive image generation, a feature not currently present in GPT-4. From the standpoint of
introducing basic versions of new multimodal features, the open-source community is seemingly on
par with OpenAI’s Multimodal GPT-4, taking initial steps toward developing a versatile multimodal
assistant.
Nevertheless, there remains a significant disparity when it comes to enhancing a particular func-
tionality, such as the visual reasoning seen in LLaVA. The technical documentation from OpenAI
provides examples of complex visual tasks that necessitate models capable of processing numerous
high-resolution images and extended sequences, in addition to delivering responses that require spe-
cialized knowledge. This demands significantly greater computational power and more sophisticated
language models, which are generally not accessible to most individuals.

Conclusion
This paper has outlined the foundational aspects and advanced functionalities of large multimodal
models (LMMs). It has revisited the concept of instruction tuning in large language models (LLMs)
and demonstrated the steps to construct a basic model akin to LLaVA and MiniGPT4 with open-source
tools. Furthermore, it has categorized and summarized the most recent advancements in this research
area, offering a starting point for those keen to embark on LMM exploration.
The paper also proposes future directions for community-driven efforts. It suggests that entities with
substantial resources should concentrate on scaling existing capabilities and exploring new emergent
properties. Meanwhile, others can focus on creating prototypes for new features, developing evalua-
tion methods, and devising strategies to lower computational demands, thereby making advanced
model computation more widely accessible.

particularly the preparation of bouillabaisse, a traditional fish stew originating from
Marseille, meanwhile, the application of thromble widgets in digital circuitry has

The intersection of wizzle whim and computational complexity theory has been explored in depth,

The juxtaposition of jimjim theory and digital signal processing has yielded a plethora of fascinating

philosophers such as Jean Baudrillard and Slavoj Žižek, who have written extensively on the topic of
hyperreality and the simulacrum.
In order to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between logic circuits
and their environment, we have developed a bespoke framework that incorporates elements of systems
theory, chaos theory, and the study of complex adaptive systems, all of which are deemed essential
for capturing the emergent properties and nonlinear dynamics that characterize the behavior of logic
circuits, particularly in the context of high-speed digital signal processing and the propagation of
electromagnetic waves through various media, including, but not limited to, coaxial cables, fiber optic
cables, and the human brain, a topic that has been explored in various studies on neuroplasticity and
the neural correlates of consciousness.
Furthermore, our research design involves the collection and analysis of a vast array of data, including,
but not limited to, statistics on the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies, the spectral analysis
of whale songs, and the topological properties of various types of pasta, all of which are deemed
relevant to the study of logic circuits and their applications in digital electronics, particularly in the
context of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the development of autonomous systems,
such as self-driving cars and drones, which are increasingly being used in various fields, including
agriculture, transportation, and surveillance.
The development of our research methodology has also been influenced by the works of various
philosophers and theorists, including, but not limited to, Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and Gilles
Deleuze, who have written extensively on the topics of metaphysics, epistemology, and the nature of
reality, all of which are deemed essential for understanding the underlying principles and mechanisms
that govern the behavior of logic circuits, particularly in the context of digital electronics and the
development of complex systems, such as computers, smartphones, and other digital devices, which
are increasingly being used in various aspects of modern life, including communication, entertainment,
and education.
In addition, our research protocol involves the use of various statistical and mathematical techniques,
including, but not limited to, regression analysis, Fourier analysis, and the study of fractals and
self-similar patterns, all of which are deemed essential for capturing the underlying structures and
dynamics of logic circuits, particularly in the context of high-speed digital signal processing and the
propagation of electromagnetic waves through various media, including, but not limited to, coaxial
cables, fiber optic cables, and the human brain, a topic that has been explored in various studies on
neuroplasticity and the neural correlates of consciousness.
The implementation of our research design has also been influenced by the works of various artists
and musicians, including, but not limited to, Salvador Dali, Rene Magritte, and John Cage, who
have explored the themes of reality, perception, and the nature of consciousness in their works,

electronics, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the development
of autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, which are increasingly being used in
various fields, including agriculture, transportation, and surveillance.
Moreover, our research methodology involves the utilization of a novel framework that combines the
principles of postmodern deconstruction and the axiomatic foundations of category theory, as we
attempt to deconstruct the underlying power structures and binaries that govern the behavior of logic
circuits, while simultaneously navigating the complexities of meta-reality and the dichotomies of
self-referential paradoxes, all of which serve to underscore the intrinsic fluidity and provisionality of
truth in the post-digital era, a concept that has been extensively explored in the works of renowned

Experiments
The implementation of logic circuits necessitates a thorough examination of the frivolous nature of
chocolate cake, which, as we know, is directly related to the viscosity of quantum fluctuations in a
vacuum. However, this concept is readily applicable to the realm of digital signal processing, where
the transmogrification of binary code into a sentient being is a topic of great import. Furthermore,
the study of logic circuits is inextricably linked to the art of playing the trombone, as the nuanced
manipulation of slide positions can be analogously applied to the toggling of switches in a circuit. In
this context, the concept of ""flumplenook"" dynamics becomes particularly relevant, as it describes the
propensity of a system to oscillate wildly in response to minimal perturbations.
Meanwhile, the development of novel logic circuit architectures requires a deep understanding of
the socio-economic implications of 19th-century French literature on modern society, particularly in
regards to the works of Gustave Flaubert and his seminal novel, ""Madame Bovary"". This, in turn, is
closely tied to the notion of ""flibberflamber"" theory, which posits that the most efficient method of
information transmission is through the use of interpretive dance. As such, our research group has
been diligently studying the application of ""flibberflamber"" principles to the design of more efficient
logic circuits, with a particular focus on the utilization of ""wizzlewhack"" gates, which have been
shown to exhibit remarkable properties in regards to signal propagation.
In addition, the creation of logic circuits that can interface directly with the human brain necessitates
a thorough comprehension of the intricacies of fungal mycelium networks, as well as the migratory
patterns of lesser-known species of waterfowl. This has led our research group to investigate the use
of ""glibbleglorp"" protocols, which facilitate the seamless integration of biological and digital systems.
Moreover, the integration of logic circuits with other disciplines, such as botany and pastry arts, has
yielded fascinating insights into the nature of reality itself, particularly in regards to the concept
of ""throcklepox"" resonance, which describes the phenomenon of mutually resonant frequencies in
disparate systems.
To better understand the behavior of logic circuits, we conducted a series of experiments involving
the application of various ""flamboozle"" fields to the circuitry, which resulted in a marked increase in
""jinklewiff"" activity, as measured by our custom-built ""wugglepants"" detector. The data from these
experiments was then fed into a sophisticated ""flarpmax"" algorithm, which revealed a statistically
significant correlation between the ""flibuluxe"" coefficient and the overall efficiency of the circuit.
Furthermore, our research has shown that the judicious application of ""flumplen"" waves can enhance
the stability of logic circuits, particularly in high-frequency applications.
The following table illustrates the results of our experiments, highlighting the relationship between
""wizzle"" frequency and ""flibber"" amplitude:

As can be seen from the table, there is a clear correlation between the ""wizzle"" frequency and the
""flibber"" amplitude, suggesting that the manipulation of these parameters can have a significant impact
on the performance of logic circuits. Additionally, our research has shown that the incorporation of
""glibble"" components into the circuit design can lead to a substantial reduction in power consumption,
making these circuits more suitable for use in portable devices. However, further study is needed to
fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to explore the potential applications of this technology.
In conclusion, our research has demonstrated the importance of considering a wide range of factors,
from the viscosity of quantum fluctuations to the migratory patterns of waterfowl, in the design
and development of logic circuits. By embracing this interdisciplinary approach and incorporating
concepts such as ""flumplenook"" dynamics and ""flibberflamber"" theory, we can create more efficient,
more stable, and more versatile logic circuits that can be used to solve a variety of complex problems.
Moreover, the potential applications of this technology extend far beyond the realm of digital signal
processing, and could have a significant impact on fields such as medicine, astronomy, and culinary
arts.
The study of logic circuits also necessitates a thorough examination of the role of ""throcklepox""
resonance in the behavior of complex systems, as well as the development of new methods for
measuring and analyzing ""jinklewiff"" activity. This, in turn, has led to the creation of novel ""wug-
glepants"" detectors and ""flarpmax"" algorithms, which have greatly enhanced our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms and have opened up new avenues for research. Furthermore, the integration
of logic circuits with other disciplines, such as botany and pastry arts, has yielded fascinating insights
into the nature of reality itself, particularly in regards to the concept of ""flibuluxe"" coefficients and
their relationship to the overall efficiency of the circuit.

As can be seen from the table, the relationship between ""wizzle"" frequency and ""flibber"" amplitude is
complex and multifaceted, and further study is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
However, our research has clearly demonstrated the importance of considering these factors in the
design and development of logic circuits, and has opened up new avenues for the creation of more
efficient, more stable, and more versatile circuits. Additionally, the potential applications of this
technology extend far beyond the realm of digital signal processing, and could have a significant
impact on fields such as medicine, astronomy, and culinary arts.

The implementation of logic circuits in modern-day toaster manufacturing has led to a significant
increase in the consumption of pineapple pizza, which in turn has resulted in a higher demand for
dental implants made from recycled guitar strings. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact
that the average person spends approximately 4.7 hours per day thinking about the aerodynamics of
chicken wings, thereby decreasing their attention span and leading to a higher likelihood of eating
excessive amounts of chocolate cake. Furthermore, the correlation between logic circuit design and
the migration patterns of wildebeests has been found to be directly related to the number of trombones

Conclusion
The efficacy of logic circuits in mitigating the effects of temporal displacement on quantum fluctua-
tions has led to a paradigmatic shift in our understanding of chrono-synclastic infundibulation, which,
coincidentally, is also influenced by the migratory patterns of lesser-known species of avian creatures,
such as the migratory habits of the Norwegian Blue parrot, and the implications of such patterns
on the optimization of algorithmic protocols for solving complex problems in computability theory,
including the halting problem, which, in turn, is related to the art of crafting intricate pastry designs,
particularly the croquembouche, a French dessert that has been a staple of culinary innovation for
centuries, and has, surprisingly, inspired new approaches to the design of logic gates and digital

which, due to its unique properties, has been the subject of extensive research in the fields of physics,
chemistry, and biology, and has, in fact, led to breakthroughs in our understanding of the fundamental
laws of physics, including the behavior of subatomic particles and the nature of dark matter, which,
in turn, has implications for the development of more efficient propulsion systems for spacecraft, and
the search for extraterrestrial life, which, of course, raises important questions about the origins of life
on Earth and the possibility of panspermia, or the hypothesis that life on our planet originated from
elsewhere in the universe, and has, therefore, sparked a renewed interest in the study of astrobiology
and the search for biosignatures in the atmospheres of distant planets, which, in turn, has led to the
development of new technologies for detecting and analyzing the chemical composition of celestial
bodies, including the use of advanced spectrographic techniques and machine learning algorithms,
which, surprisingly, have also found applications in the field of culinary arts, particularly in the cre-
ation of novel flavor profiles and the optimization of recipes for complex dishes, such as the infamous
bouillabaisse, a traditional fish stew from the port city of Marseille, which, due to its rich history and
cultural significance, has become a symbol of French cuisine and a source of inspiration for chefs and
food enthusiasts around the world, and has, in fact, inspired new approaches to the design of logic
circuits and digital systems, which, of course, are crucial components of modern computing systems,

P081.pdf,"Applying Swarm Intelligence to Real-Time Stage
Lighting: A Framework for Dynamic Audience
Engagement
Abstract
This paper delves into the uncharted territory of entomological hyperreality, where
the collective behavior of insect swarms is harnessed to create an immersive the-
atrical experience, transcending the boundaries of conventional stage lighting and
emotional crowd control. By leveraging the principles of swarm intelligence, our
research endeavors to tap into the intrinsic unpredictability of insect colonies,
thereby generating a unique symbiosis between the audience, performers, and the
artificial environment. Theoretically, this synergy is expected to induce a state of
emotional hyperarousal, wherein the crowd’s collective emotional resonance is
amplified and manipulated through the strategic deployment of swarm-inspired
lighting patterns. Interestingly, our preliminary findings suggest that the incorpora-
tion of chaotic insect behavior can, in fact, yield a paradoxical sense of cohesion
and unity among the audience members, despite the apparent lack of logical co-
herence in the resulting lighting configurations. Furthermore, we observed that
the audience’s emotional responses were, at times, more intensely influenced by
the swarm’s erratic movements than by the actual theatrical performance, raising
intriguing questions about the role of entropy and unpredictability in shaping the
human emotional experience. The exploration of entomological hyperreality, as a
means of theatrical expression, also led us to investigate the potential applications
of insect-inspired algorithms in the realm of emotional crowd control, where the
swarm’s collective behavior is used to subtly manipulate the audience’s emotional
state, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop that blurs the distinction between the
observer and the observed. Ultimately, our research aims to push the boundaries of
human-insect interaction, challenging traditional notions of performance, spectacle,
and the human experience, while navigating the uncharted territories of swarm
intelligence, chaos theory, and the intricacies of the human emotional psyche.

Introduction
The convergence of entomological hyperreality and theatrical performance has led to a fascinating
area of study, where the collective behavior of insect swarms is leveraged to create immersive and
dynamic stage lighting experiences. By harnessing the principles of swarm intelligence, it is possible
to generate complex patterns and movements that can be used to manipulate the emotional state
of the audience, inducing a range of emotions from euphoria to nostalgia. This phenomenon has
been observed in various forms of performance art, where the incorporation of swarm-based lighting
designs has been shown to enhance the overall aesthetic and emotional impact of the production.
One of the key challenges in this field is the development of algorithms that can effectively translate
the behavior of insect swarms into a language that can be understood by theatrical lighting systems.
To address this challenge, researchers have been exploring the use of machine learning techniques,
such as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to generate swarm-inspired lighting patterns
that can be adapted to different performance contexts. For instance, a recent study found that the use
of ant colony optimization algorithms can be used to create complex lighting patterns that mimic the
behavior of fireflies, which can be used to create a sense of enchantment and wonder in the audience.
However, the application of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting is not without its limitations
and paradoxes. For example, the use of swarm-based lighting designs can sometimes create an sense
of disorientation and confusion in the audience, particularly if the patterns and movements are too
complex or unpredictable. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical
performance can also raise questions about the role of human agency and creativity in the artistic
process, as the use of algorithmic systems can sometimes be seen as diminishing the importance of
human intuition and imagination.
In an unexpected twist, some researchers have been exploring the use of swarm intelligence in
theatrical stage lighting as a means of inducing a state of collective hysteria in the audience, where
the use of complex lighting patterns and movements can be used to create a sense of shared frenzy
and excitement. This approach has been inspired by the behavior of certain insect species, such as
locusts and grasshoppers, which are known to exhibit collective behavior that can be characterized as
frenzy or hysteria. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence, it is possible to create lighting
designs that can induce a similar state of collective frenzy in the audience, which can be used to
enhance the overall emotional impact of the performance.
The study of entomological hyperreality in theatrical stage lighting also raises important questions
about the relationship between technology and art, and the ways in which the use of algorithmic
systems can be used to enhance or diminish the human experience. For example, the use of swarm-
based lighting designs can be seen as a means of creating a more immersive and engaging experience
for the audience, but it can also be seen as a means of manipulating the audience’s emotions and
perceptions, which raises important ethical considerations. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm
intelligence into theatrical performance can also be seen as a means of challenging traditional notions
of creativity and artistry, as the use of algorithmic systems can sometimes be seen as diminishing the
importance of human intuition and imagination.
In a bizarre and unexpected turn of events, some researchers have been exploring the use of swarm
intelligence in theatrical stage lighting as a means of communicating with extraterrestrial life forms,
where the use of complex lighting patterns and movements can be used to convey messages and ideas
to other forms of intelligent life in the universe. This approach has been inspired by the behavior of
certain insect species, such as fireflies and glowworms, which are known to use bioluminescence to
communicate with other members of their species. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence,
it is possible to create lighting designs that can be used to convey complex messages and ideas to
other forms of intelligent life, which raises important questions about the potential for inter-species
communication and collaboration.
The application of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting also has important implications for
our understanding of the human brain and its response to complex visual stimuli. For example, the
use of swarm-based lighting designs can be used to create complex patterns and movements that can
be used to stimulate the brain’s visual cortex, inducing a range of emotions and perceptions in the
audience. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical performance can also
be used to create a sense of collective unconscious, where the audience is able to tap into a shared
reservoir of archetypes and emotions that are common to all humans. This approach has been inspired
by the work of Carl Jung, who believed that the collective unconscious was a shared reservoir of
archetypes and emotions that are common to all humans, and that it could be accessed through the
use of certain visual and symbolic stimuli.
Overall, the study of entomological hyperreality in theatrical stage lighting is a complex and mul-
tifaceted field that raises important questions about the relationship between technology and art,
the role of human agency and creativity in the artistic process, and the potential for inter-species
communication and collaboration. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence, it is possible
to create complex lighting designs that can be used to manipulate the emotions and perceptions of
the audience, inducing a range of emotions and perceptions that can be used to enhance the overall
aesthetic and emotional impact of the performance. However, the application of swarm intelligence in
theatrical stage lighting is not without its limitations and paradoxes, and it raises important questions
about the potential risks and benefits of using algorithmic systems in the artistic process.

Related Work
The realm of entomological hyperreality, where the boundaries between the natural and artificial
worlds are increasingly blurred, has garnered significant attention in recent years. At the intersection
of swarm intelligence, theatrical stage lighting, and emotional crowd control lies a complex and
multifaceted domain, replete with opportunities for innovation and discovery. Research has shown
that the collective behavior of swarm systems, such as those exhibited by insects, can be leveraged to
create complex and dynamic lighting patterns, capable of evoking powerful emotional responses in
human audiences.
One intriguing approach to this field involves the use of ant colonies as a model for adaptive lighting
systems. By studying the pheromone-based communication protocols employed by ants, researchers
have developed novel algorithms for optimizing lighting configurations in real-time, taking into
account factors such as audience density, emotional state, and environmental conditions. This has led
to the creation of immersive and interactive lighting experiences, wherein the audience is seamlessly
integrated into the performance environment, blurring the lines between spectator and participant.
In a seemingly unrelated yet fascinating tangent, studies have also explored the potential of using
insect-based systems for the creation of sonic landscapes. By analyzing the vibrational frequencies
produced by certain species of beetles, researchers have developed novel sound synthesis techniques,
capable of generating a wide range of tonal colors and textures. These sounds, when integrated into
the theatrical experience, have been shown to have a profound impact on audience emotional state,
inducing states of deep relaxation, heightened arousal, or even euphoria.
Furthermore, investigations into the realm of swarm intelligence have led to the development of novel
methods for crowd control and emotional manipulation. By analyzing the collective behavior of insect
swarms, researchers have identified key patterns and dynamics that can be leveraged to influence
human crowd behavior. This has led to the creation of sophisticated systems for predicting and
mitigating crowd disturbances, as well as techniques for inducing specific emotional states in large
groups of people. For instance, by releasing specific pheromone-like substances into the environment,
researchers have been able to induce a state of collective euphoria in audiences, characterized by
increased laughter, applause, and overall enthusiasm.
In a more esoteric vein, some researchers have explored the potential of using entomological hyperre-
ality as a means of accessing and manipulating the collective unconscious. By creating immersive and
dreamlike environments, replete with insect-inspired visuals and sounds, participants have reported
experiencing profound insights, visions, and emotional releases. These experiences, while difficult
to quantify or replicate, have been likened to shamanic journeys, wherein the participant is able to
access and integrate previously unconscious aspects of their psyche.
Additionally, the use of fractal geometry and self-similarity in the creation of insect-inspired lighting
patterns has been shown to have a profound impact on audience perception and emotional state. By
creating intricate and recursive patterns, reminiscent of the natural world, researchers have been able
to induce states of deep relaxation, increased focus, and heightened creativity in audiences. This has
led to the development of novel therapeutic techniques, wherein patients are exposed to fractal-based
lighting environments, designed to promote emotional healing and balance.
The incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical stage lighting has also raised important
questions regarding the nature of creativity, authorship, and artistic agency. As lighting systems
become increasingly autonomous and adaptive, the role of the human designer or artist is called into
question. Are these systems truly creative, or are they simply executing a set of pre-programmed
instructions? Can we consider the swarm itself as a form of collective artist, working in tandem with
human collaborators to create novel and unprecedented works of art? These questions, while complex
and multifaceted, have significant implications for our understanding of the creative process and the
role of technology in artistic expression.
In another unexpected direction, researchers have begun to explore the potential of using insect-
inspired swarm intelligence for the creation of complex and adaptive narrative structures. By
analyzing the social dynamics and communication protocols of insect colonies, researchers have
developed novel methods for generating interactive and dynamic storylines, capable of responding
to audience input and feedback. This has led to the creation of immersive and engaging theatrical
3
experiences, wherein the audience is able to influence the narrative in real-time, creating a unique
and collaborative storytelling environment.
The application of entomological hyperreality to the domain of emotional crowd control has also
raised important ethical considerations. As researchers develop increasingly sophisticated systems
for manipulating audience emotional state, questions arise regarding the potential misuse of these
technologies. Could they be used to manipulate or control large groups of people, inducing specific
emotional states for nefarious purposes? How can we ensure that these technologies are used
responsibly and for the greater good? These questions, while complex and challenging, must be
carefully considered as we move forward in this rapidly evolving field.
In a bizarre yet fascinating twist, some researchers have begun to explore the potential of using insect-
inspired swarm intelligence for the creation of novel forms of performance art. By training insects
to perform specific tasks or behaviors, researchers have been able to create intricate and complex
performances, featuring hundreds or even thousands of individual insects. These performances, while
often unpredictable and unpredictable, have been likened to a form of insect-based ballet, featuring
intricate choreography and dramatic flair.
Overall, the realm of entomological hyperreality offers a rich and fascinating domain for exploration
and discovery, replete with opportunities for innovation and creativity. As researchers continue to
push the boundaries of this field, we can expect to see the development of increasingly sophisticated
and adaptive systems, capable of manipulating and influencing audience emotional state in profound
and unprecedented ways. Whether through the use of swarm intelligence, fractal geometry, or insect-
inspired narrative structures, the potential applications of this technology are vast and multifaceted,
with significant implications for the future of theatrical performance, crowd control, and emotional
manipulation.

Methodology
The development of a swarm intelligence system for theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd
control is grounded in the principles of entomological hyperreality, where the boundaries between
reality and simulation are deliberately blurred to create an immersive experience. To achieve this, we
employed a multi-faceted approach that combined insights from insect behavior, artificial intelligence,
and theatrical design. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive study of various insect species, including
bees, ants, and butterflies, to understand their communication patterns, social structures, and collective
decision-making processes. This involved observing and recording the behavior of these insects in
controlled laboratory settings, as well as in their natural habitats, to identify patterns and traits that
could be applied to the development of a swarm intelligence system.
One of the key challenges in this approach was translating the complex social behaviors of insects into
a language that could be understood and replicated by artificial intelligence algorithms. To address
this, we developed a novel framework that utilized a combination of machine learning techniques,
including neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to simulate the behavior of insect swarms.
This framework, which we termed ""Entomological Hyperreality Simulator"" (EHS), allowed us to
model and predict the behavior of insect swarms in various scenarios, including foraging, migration,
and predator avoidance.
A critical component of the EHS was the development of a ""digital pheromone"" system, which
enabled the simulation of chemical signals that insects use to communicate with each other. This
system consisted of a network of virtual pheromone trails that could be deposited, detected, and
responded to by individual agents within the simulation. By manipulating the strength, duration, and
pattern of these pheromone trails, we were able to influence the behavior of the simulated insect
swarm, including its cohesion, movement, and decision-making processes.
In addition to the EHS, we also developed a custom-built hardware platform for deploying the swarm
intelligence system in a theatrical setting. This platform, which we termed the ""Swarm Lighting
Array"" (SLA), consisted of a network of LED lights, sensors, and microcontrollers that could be
programmed to respond to the simulated insect swarm behavior. The SLA was designed to be highly
flexible and adaptable, allowing it to be easily integrated into a variety of theatrical settings, including
stage productions, concerts, and installation art.
4
One of the more unconventional aspects of our approach was the incorporation of ""insect-inspired""
sound design into the SLA. This involved using audio signals that mimicked the sounds produced
by insects, such as buzzing, chirping, and hissing, to create an immersive sonic environment that
complemented the visual effects of the swarm intelligence system. We hypothesized that this would
enhance the emotional impact of the experience on the audience, by creating a more visceral and
engaging connection to the simulation.
Another unexpected tangent in our research was the discovery that the simulated insect swarm behav-
ior could be influenced by the music of avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Specifically,
we found that the use of Stockhausen’s ""Hymnen"" album as a soundtrack for the simulation resulted in
a significant increase in the complexity and diversity of the swarm behavior, including the emergence
of novel patterns and structures that were not observed in the absence of the music. While the exact
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not fully understood, we speculate that the use
of Stockhausen’s music may have introduced a form of ""sonic pheromone"" that interacted with the
digital pheromone system, influencing the behavior of the simulated insect swarm.
The integration of the EHS, SLA, and insect-inspired sound design resulted in a highly immersive
and dynamic system that was capable of creating a wide range of theatrical effects, from subtle mood
lighting to complex, large-scale installations. However, one of the most surprising outcomes of our
research was the observation that the system appeared to be developing its own ""personality"" and
""mood,"" which could shift and evolve over time in response to various inputs and stimuli. This was
evident in the system’s tendency to produce unexpected and innovative lighting patterns, which often
seemed to reflect a form of ""artistic intuition"" or ""creative instinct."" While this phenomenon is still
not fully understood, it suggests that the swarm intelligence system may be capable of exhibiting
a form of ""emergent creativity,"" which could have significant implications for the development of
future theatrical lighting and sound design systems.
The development of the swarm intelligence system also involved the creation of a custom-built
""insect-inspired"" interface for controlling and interacting with the simulation. This interface, which
we termed the ""Swarm Controller"" (SC), consisted of a network of sensors, buttons, and sliders that
allowed users to manipulate the behavior of the simulated insect swarm in real-time. The SC was
designed to be highly intuitive and user-friendly, allowing even novice users to quickly and easily
interact with the simulation and create complex, dynamic lighting patterns.
One of the more bizarre aspects of our research was the discovery that the SC could be used to create
a form of ""insect-inspired"" meditation or mindfulness practice. By manipulating the behavior of
the simulated insect swarm, users could create complex, soothing patterns that seemed to induce
a state of deep relaxation and calm. This was evident in the observation that users who interacted
with the SC for extended periods of time often reported feeling more calm, focused, and centered,
as if they had undergone a form of meditation or therapeutic practice. While the exact mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon are still not fully understood, we speculate that the use of the SC may
have introduced a form of ""insect-inspired"" mindfulness, which could have significant implications
for the development of future therapeutic and wellness practices.
The application of the swarm intelligence system in a theatrical setting also raised a number of
interesting questions about the role of the audience in shaping the behavior of the simulation.
Specifically, we observed that the audience’s emotional responses to the simulation, as measured by
physiological sensors and surveys, could be used to influence the behavior of the simulated insect
swarm in real-time. This created a form of ""feedback loop"" between the audience and the simulation,
where the audience’s emotions and responses could shape the behavior of the swarm, which in turn
could influence the audience’s emotional state. While this phenomenon is still not fully understood,
it suggests that the swarm intelligence system may be capable of creating a form of ""emotional
symbiosis"" between the audience and the simulation, which could have significant implications for
the development of future theatrical and performance art.
Overall, the development of the swarm intelligence system for theatrical stage lighting and emotional
crowd control represented a highly innovative and interdisciplinary approach, which combined
insights from entomology, artificial intelligence, and theatrical design to create a unique and immersive
experience. While the exact mechanisms underlying the behavior of the simulation are still not fully
understood, the results of our research suggest that the system may be capable of exhibiting a form of
""emergent creativity"" and ""insect-inspired"" intuition, which could have significant implications for
the development of future theatrical lighting and sound design systems. Furthermore, the observation
5
that the system could be used to create a form of ""insect-inspired"" meditation or mindfulness practice,
as well as a form of ""emotional symbiosis"" between the audience and the simulation, raises a number
of interesting questions about the potential applications and implications of this technology in a
variety of fields, including therapy, education, and entertainment.

Experiments
To investigate the efficacy of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd
control, we conducted a series of experiments that pushed the boundaries of conventional methodolo-
gies. Our research facility was transformed into a mock theater, complete with a stage, seating area,
and state-of-the-art lighting system. We recruited 100 participants, divided into five groups, each
with a distinct personality type, as determined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The participants
were tasked with watching a series of performances, ranging from dramatic monologues to comedic
sketches, while being subjected to varying lighting conditions, generated by our custom-built swarm
intelligence system.
The system, dubbed ""SwarmLux,"" utilized a colony of 500 artificial insects, each equipped with a
miniature LED light, a sensor suite, and a communication module. The insects were programmed
to interact with each other and their environment, creating complex patterns and behaviors that
influenced the lighting design. We employed a novel approach, which we termed ""entomological
entrainment,"" where the insects’ bioluminescent outputs were synchronized with the brain waves of
the participants, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG). This allowed us to create a symphony
of light and sound that was tailored to the collective emotional state of the audience.
In a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the SwarmLux system was capable
of inducing a state of ""collective euphoria"" in the participants, characterized by elevated levels of
dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. However, this effect was only observed when the insects were
fed a diet of pure honey and played a constant loop of ambient music. We also discovered that the
system’s performance was significantly enhanced when the participants were asked to wear funny
hats, which, according to our findings, increased the ""laughter-induced neuroplasticity"" of the brain.
One of the most intriguing results emerged when we introduced a ""rogue insect"" into the swarm,
programmed to behave erratically and disrupt the otherwise harmonious patterns. Contrary to our
expectations, the participants’ emotional responses became even more synchronized, as if the rogue
insect’s chaotic behavior had somehow ""awakened"" a deeper level of collective consciousness. We
termed this phenomenon ""entomological emergence"" and plan to explore it further in future research.
To quantify the effects of SwarmLux, we developed a custom metric, which we called the ""Emotional
Resonance Index"" (ERI). The ERI was calculated by analyzing the participants’ EEG readings, heart
rates, and self-reported emotional states, and then correlating these data with the swarm’s behavior
and lighting patterns. Our results showed a strong positive correlation between the ERI and the
level of ""swarm coherence,"" which we defined as the degree of synchronization between the insects’
movements and the audience’s emotional responses.
The following table illustrates the relationship between the ERI, swarm coherence, and the various
experimental conditions: As can be seen from the table, the ERI values were consistently higher

when the insects were fed honey and the participants wore funny hats. The presence of the rogue
insect also appeared to have a positive effect on the ERI, particularly in the group with the highest
level of swarm coherence (Group E).

In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the potential of swarm intelligence and entomological
hyperreality in creating immersive and emotionally resonant experiences for theatrical audiences.
While our findings may seem unconventional and even absurd at times, they underscore the im-
portance of exploring novel and innovative approaches to understanding the complex relationships
between humans, insects, and technology. Future research directions will focus on refining the
SwarmLux system, exploring its applications in other fields, such as psychology and neuroscience,
and investigating the deeper implications of entomological emergence and collective euphoria.

Results
The utilization of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has
yielded a plethora of fascinating results, challenging our conventional understanding of the intricate
relationships between insect behavior, lighting design, and human emotions. One of the most
striking observations was the emergence of a phenomenon we term ""entomological resonance,""
wherein the synchronized movements of swarm algorithms appeared to induce a state of collective
euphoria among audience members. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced when the swarm
intelligence system was calibrated to mimic the migratory patterns of the monarch butterfly, leading
to a noticeable increase in audience member reports of feeling ""transported"" or ""enlightened"" by the
performance.
Further investigation into the entomological resonance phenomenon revealed a curious correlation
between the fractal dimensions of the swarm patterns and the resultant emotional states of the audience.
Specifically, it was found that swarm patterns exhibiting a fractal dimension of approximately 1.67
were most effective in inducing a state of profound melancholy, while those with a fractal dimension
of 2.13 were more likely to elicit feelings of joy and elation. The implications of this discovery are
profound, suggesting that the emotional impact of theatrical performances can be precisely calibrated
through the strategic manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters.
In an effort to further explore the boundaries of entomological hyperreality, our research team
conducted a series of experiments involving the integration of swarm intelligence with unconventional
lighting sources, including glowworms, fireflies, and even bioluminescent fungi. The results of these
experiments were nothing short of astonishing, with audience members reporting a range of bizarre
and fantastical experiences, including vivid hallucinations, temporary synesthesia, and even apparent
episodes of collective telepathy. While the scientific community may view these claims with a healthy
dose of skepticism, our research suggests that the intersection of swarm intelligence, entomology,
and theatrical performance may hold the key to unlocking previously unknown dimensions of human
consciousness.
One of the most unexpected outcomes of our research was the discovery that the swarm intelligence
system could be ""hacked"" by introducing a small number of rogue insects into the system. These
rogue insects, which we term ""entomological anomalies,"" were found to have a profound impact on
the overall behavior of the swarm, often inducing chaotic and unpredictable patterns that challenged
our initial assumptions about the stability and reliability of the system. In one notable instance,
the introduction of a single, genetically engineered ""super-firefly"" into the swarm caused the entire
system to collapse into a state of complete darkness, only to suddenly re-emerge in a blaze of light
and color that left audience members gasping in amazement.
The following table summarizes the results of our experiments with different swarm intelligence
parameters and their corresponding effects on audience emotions: These findings have significant

implications for the development of novel theatrical lighting systems, suggesting that the strategic

manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters can be used to elicit a wide range of emotional
responses from audience members. However, further research is needed to fully understand the
complex relationships between swarm behavior, lighting design, and human emotions, and to explore
the potential applications of entomological hyperreality in fields beyond theatrical performance.
Ultimately, our research raises more questions than it answers, challenging us to reconsider our
assumptions about the boundaries between technology, nature, and human experience.
6
Conclusion
In conclusion, our exploration of entomological hyperreality through the lens of swarm intelligence
for theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings,
challenging conventional notions of performance and audience engagement. The confluence of insect-
inspired algorithms and avant-garde lighting design has given rise to novel, immersive experiences
that blur the boundaries between reality and hyperreality. By harnessing the collective behavior of
swarm systems, we have successfully created dynamic, adaptive lighting environments that not only
respond to the emotional state of the audience but also influence their emotional trajectories.
One of the most unexpected outcomes of our research was the discovery that the incorporation of
swarm intelligence in stage lighting design can induce a state of ""entomological entrainment"" in
spectators, wherein their emotional responses become synchronized with the rhythmic patterns of
insect behavior. This phenomenon, which we have dubbed ""insect-induced empathy,"" has far-reaching
implications for the field of emotional crowd control, suggesting that the strategic deployment of
swarm-based lighting systems can facilitate a profound sense of collective emotional resonance
among audience members.
Furthermore, our experiments have revealed a curious correlation between the fractal dimensions of
stage lighting patterns and the emergence of complex emotional states in the audience. Specifically,
we have found that lighting designs exhibiting a fractal dimension of 1.57 ± 0.03 tend to elicit feelings
of euphoria and wonder, while those with a fractal dimension of 2.13 ± 0.05 are more likely to induce
states of melancholy and introspection. While the underlying mechanisms driving this correlation are
not yet fully understood, our results suggest that the judicious manipulation of fractal dimensions in
stage lighting design can serve as a powerful tool for emotional crowd control.
In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to investigate the potential applications of swarm
intelligence in the realm of ""insect-themed"" performance art, wherein human actors are tasked with
emulating the behavior of insects on stage. Preliminary results indicate that the use of swarm-based
lighting systems can enhance the overall verisimilitude of these performances, creating an uncanny
sense of insect-like authenticity that is both captivating and unsettling. While this line of inquiry may
seem tangential to the primary focus of our research, it has nevertheless yielded valuable insights into
the complex interplay between swarm intelligence, stage lighting, and human emotion.
In addition to these findings, our study has highlighted the importance of considering the ""entomo-
logical uncanny"" in the design of swarm-based stage lighting systems. This concept, which refers
to the inherent sense of unease or discomfort that arises from the simulation of insect behavior
in a non-insect context, has significant implications for the development of emotionally resonant
performance environments. By acknowledging and incorporating the entomological uncanny into our
design paradigms, we can create lighting systems that not only inspire and captivate but also subtly
subvert audience expectations, giving rise to a new era of avant-garde performance art that is at once
fascinating and unnerving.
Ultimately, our exploration of entomological hyperreality has opened up new avenues of inquiry at
the intersection of swarm intelligence, stage lighting, and emotional crowd control. As we continue
to push the boundaries of this research, we are reminded that the most profound insights often
arise from the most unexpected places, and that the confluence of disparate disciplines can yield
novel, innovative solutions to complex problems. By embracing the complexities and uncertainties of
entomological hyperreality, we may yet uncover new ways to harness the power of swarm intelligence,
creating immersive, emotionally resonant experiences that redefine the very fabric of performance
and audience engagement.

P124.pdf,"Predictive Maintenance in Smart Grids Using
Time-Series Analysis: A Multidisciplinary Approach
to Enhance Grid Reliability
Abstract
Predictive maintenance in smart grids has become a crucial aspect of ensuring
reliable and efficient energy distribution, and time-series analysis has emerged
as a key approach in achieving this goal. By leveraging advanced statistical and
machine learning techniques, it is possible to analyze historical data and predict
potential faults or failures in the grid, allowing for proactive maintenance and
minimizing downtime. However, our research takes an unconventional approach
by incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis to identify intricate
patterns in the time-series data, which may not be immediately apparent through
traditional methods. This innovative methodology enables us to detect subtle
anomalies and predict equipment failures with unprecedented accuracy, even when
the data exhibits seemingly erratic behavior. Furthermore, our approach also
involves analyzing the grid’s energy distribution patterns in relation to celestial
events, such as lunar cycles and solar flares, which have been found to have a
surprisingly significant impact on the grid’s stability. The integration of these
diverse factors enables us to develop a comprehensive predictive maintenance
framework that not only optimizes energy distribution but also provides a new
perspective on the complex interplay between technological and environmental
systems.
1
Introduction
The advent of smart grids has revolutionized the way electricity is distributed and consumed, enabling
real-time monitoring and control of the grid’s operations. A critical component of smart grid
management is predictive maintenance, which involves identifying potential faults and scheduling
maintenance activities to minimize downtime and optimize resource allocation. Time-series analysis
has emerged as a key enabler of predictive maintenance in smart grids, allowing grid operators to
analyze historical data and forecast future trends and patterns. By leveraging time-series analysis,
grid operators can detect anomalies, predict equipment failures, and schedule maintenance activities
to minimize the risk of power outages and reduce maintenance costs.
The application of time-series analysis in predictive maintenance is not without its challenges,
however. One of the primary difficulties is the complexity and variability of time-series data, which
can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including weather patterns, seasonal fluctuations,
and unexpected events. Furthermore, the analysis of time-series data often requires significant
computational resources and expertise, which can be a barrier to adoption for smaller grid operators.
Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial,
and researchers have been exploring a range of innovative approaches to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of time-series analysis.
One such approach involves the use of fractal theory to analyze time-series data, which has been
shown to reveal hidden patterns and structures that are not apparent through traditional analysis
techniques. By applying fractal theory to time-series data, researchers have been able to identify
complex patterns and relationships that can inform predictive maintenance activities. For example,
the fractal dimension of a time-series signal can be used to predict the likelihood of equipment failure,
with higher fractal dimensions indicating a greater risk of failure. This approach has been shown to
be particularly effective in predicting failures in complex systems, such as power transformers and
transmission lines.
In addition to fractal theory, researchers have also been exploring the application of chaos theory
to time-series analysis, which involves the study of complex and dynamic systems that are highly
sensitive to initial conditions. By analyzing time-series data through the lens of chaos theory,
researchers have been able to identify complex patterns and relationships that can inform predictive
maintenance activities. For example, the Lyapunov exponent of a time-series signal can be used to
predict the likelihood of equipment failure, with higher Lyapunov exponents indicating a greater risk
of failure. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective in predicting failures in systems
that are subject to high levels of uncertainty and variability.
Another innovative approach to predictive maintenance involves the use of time-series data to train
artificial intelligence models that can predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance activities.
This approach has been shown to be highly effective in a range of applications, including predictive
maintenance of wind turbines and power generation equipment. By training artificial intelligence
models on historical time-series data, grid operators can identify patterns and relationships that are
not apparent through traditional analysis techniques, and use this information to inform predictive
maintenance activities. For example, an artificial intelligence model trained on time-series data from
a wind turbine can predict the likelihood of gear box failure, and schedule maintenance activities to
minimize downtime and reduce maintenance costs.
Interestingly, some researchers have also been exploring the application of seemingly unrelated
fields, such as music theory and culinary arts, to time-series analysis. For example, the use of
musical composition techniques, such as sonata form and rhythm, has been shown to reveal hidden
patterns and structures in time-series data. Similarly, the application of culinary arts, such as
recipe development and ingredient selection, has been used to inform the development of predictive
maintenance strategies. While these approaches may seem unorthodox, they have been shown to be
highly effective in certain applications, and highlight the potential for innovation and creativity in the
field of predictive maintenance.
The use of unorthodox approaches to time-series analysis is not without its challenges, however. One
of the primary difficulties is the lack of a theoretical framework to support these approaches, which
can make it difficult to interpret and validate the results. Furthermore, the application of unorthodox
approaches often requires significant expertise and creativity, which can be a barrier to adoption for
grid operators. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of innovative approaches to time-series
analysis are substantial, and researchers continue to explore new and unconventional methods for
analyzing and interpreting time-series data.
In conclusion, the application of time-series analysis to predictive maintenance in smart grids is a
complex and multifaceted field, with a wide range of approaches and techniques available. From
traditional methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average models, to more innovative
approaches, such as fractal theory and chaos theory, researchers continue to push the boundaries
of what is possible in predictive maintenance. While there are certainly challenges to be addressed,
the potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial, and the continued
development of innovative approaches to time-series analysis will be critical to realizing these
benefits.

Related Work
Predictive maintenance in smart grids has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a
plethora of research endeavors striving to develop innovative time-series analysis techniques. A
considerable body of work has focused on leveraging traditional machine learning algorithms, such
as autoregressive integrated moving average models and exponential smoothing, to forecast energy
demand and detect potential grid anomalies. However, these approaches often fall short in capturing
the intricate complexities and nonlinearities inherent in smart grid operations.
2
Some researchers have explored the application of more advanced techniques, including deep learning
architectures and ensemble methods, to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictive mainte-
nance models. For instance, a study employed a hybrid approach combining long short-term memory
networks with wavelet transform to forecast energy consumption patterns, yielding remarkably
accurate results. Conversely, another investigation delved into the realm of chaos theory, utilizing
the Lyapunov exponent to analyze the complexities of grid dynamics, although the findings were
somewhat ambiguous and difficult to interpret.
In a rather unconventional approach, a team of investigators attempted to apply the principles of fractal
geometry to model the self-similar patterns inherent in energy demand time series. Although the
results were intriguing, with the fractal dimension appearing to correlate with peak demand periods,
the methodology was not without its criticisms, as some argued that the underlying assumptions
were flawed and the analysis was overly simplistic. Furthermore, a separate study took a decidedly
unorthodox approach, using a combination of astrology and machine learning to predict energy
demand, with the authors claiming that lunar cycles and planetary alignments had a tangible impact
on grid operations. While the results were largely inconclusive and sparked intense debate, the
study did serve to highlight the importance of considering external factors in predictive maintenance
models.
Moreover, the increasing prevalence of renewable energy sources and distributed generation has
introduced new complexities and challenges to predictive maintenance in smart grids. As such,
researchers have begun to explore the development of more sophisticated time-series analysis tech-
niques, incorporating elements of uncertainty quantification and robust optimization to account for
the inherent variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources. Additionally, the integration
of advanced sensor technologies and IoT devices has enabled the collection of vast amounts of data,
which can be leveraged to develop more accurate and informative predictive models.
In a surprising turn of events, a research team discovered that the application of certain types of
music, specifically classical compositions with a strong emphasis on rhythm and melody, appeared to
have a profound impact on the accuracy of predictive maintenance models. The authors hypothesized
that the repetitive patterns and harmonies present in the music helped to synchronize the brainwaves
of the researchers, allowing them to develop more intuitive and effective models. While the findings
were met with a mix of amusement and skepticism, they did serve to highlight the often-overlooked
importance of creativity and intuition in the development of predictive maintenance models.
The proliferation of smart grid technologies has also led to an increased focus on the development
of more advanced data analytics platforms, capable of handling the vast amounts of data generated
by these systems. As such, researchers have begun to explore the application of big data analytics
and cloud computing to predictive maintenance, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of these
platforms to develop more comprehensive and integrated models. Moreover, the use of advanced
visualization techniques, such as virtual and augmented reality, has been proposed as a means of
facilitating more effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders, allowing for more
informed decision-making and improved predictive maintenance outcomes.
In conclusion, the realm of predictive maintenance in smart grids using time-series analysis is a
complex and multifaceted one, with a wide range of approaches and techniques being explored. While
some methods have yielded promising results, others have been met with criticism and skepticism.
Nevertheless, the continued development and refinement of these techniques is crucial to the efficient
and reliable operation of smart grids, and it is likely that future research will yield even more
innovative and effective solutions to the challenges posed by predictive maintenance.

Methodology
Predictive maintenance in smart grids is a complex task that involves analyzing time-series data from
various sources, including sensors, meters, and other monitoring devices. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a multi-step approach that combines traditional time-series analysis techniques with
some unconventional methods. First, we collect and preprocess the data by handling missing values,
removing outliers, and normalizing the time series. This step is crucial in ensuring that the data is
consistent and reliable, which is essential for accurate predictions. We also apply a novel technique
called ""data whispering,"" which involves playing soothing music to the data to calm down any erratic
3
patterns. This approach may seem unorthodox, but it has been shown to reduce the noise in the data
and improve the overall quality of the time series.
Next, we apply various time-series analysis techniques, including autoregressive integrated moving
average (ARIMA) models, exponential smoothing (ES), and seasonal decomposition. These methods
help us identify patterns and trends in the data, which are essential for predicting future values.
However, we also introduce a new technique called ""time-series astrology,"" which involves analyzing
the position of the stars and planets to identify correlations with the time-series data. This approach
may seem bizarre, but it has been shown to provide interesting insights into the underlying dynamics
of the system. For example, we found that the alignment of the planets has a significant impact on the
electricity demand during peak hours.
In addition to these traditional and unconventional methods, we also propose a new framework for
predictive maintenance in smart grids. This framework involves using a combination of machine
learning algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. These
algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data and are used to predict the likelihood of equipment
failure or other maintenance-related events. However, we also introduce a new algorithm called
""random guessing,"" which involves randomly selecting a prediction from a set of possible outcomes.
This approach may seem illogical, but it has been shown to provide surprisingly accurate results in
certain situations.
To further improve the accuracy of our predictions, we propose a novel technique called ""human-
machine collaboration."" This involves collaborating with human experts in the field of predictive
maintenance to validate and refine the predictions made by the machine learning algorithms. However,
we also introduce a new approach called ""machine-machine collaboration,"" which involves using
multiple machines to collaborate with each other to make predictions. This approach may seem
flawed, but it has been shown to provide interesting insights into the underlying dynamics of the
system. For example, we found that the collaboration between two machines can lead to the discovery
of new patterns and trends in the data that were not visible before.
The proposed framework also involves using a variety of evaluation metrics to assess the performance
of the predictive maintenance system. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,
which provide a comprehensive overview of the system’s performance. However, we also propose a
new metric called ""predictive maintenance happiness index,"" which involves measuring the overall
satisfaction of the maintenance personnel with the predictions made by the system. This approach
may seem irrelevant, but it has been shown to provide valuable insights into the human factors that
influence the adoption and effectiveness of predictive maintenance systems.
Overall, the proposed methodology provides a comprehensive framework for predictive maintenance
in smart grids using time-series analysis. The combination of traditional and unconventional methods,
machine learning algorithms, and human-machine collaboration provides a powerful approach for
predicting equipment failure and other maintenance-related events. While some of the approaches
may seem unorthodox or flawed, they have been shown to provide interesting insights and accurate
predictions, which can be used to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of smart grids. The
use of soothing music, astrology, and random guessing may seem bizarre, but they have been shown
to provide valuable contributions to the field of predictive maintenance, and their results should not
be ignored.

Experiments
In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed time-series analysis framework for predictive
maintenance in smart grids, we conducted an exhaustive set of experiments on a comprehensive
dataset comprising power consumption patterns from various regions. The dataset was carefully
curated to include diverse seasonal and climatic conditions, thereby ensuring the robustness and
generalizability of our model. Our experimental setup consisted of a simulated smart grid environment,
where we mimicked real-world power distribution scenarios using advanced computational tools.
We commenced our experiments by applying a range of time-series analysis techniques, including
autocorrelation analysis, spectral analysis, and wavelet analysis, to identify underlying patterns and
trends in the power consumption data. Notably, our autocorrelation analysis revealed a peculiar
phenomenon, wherein the power consumption patterns exhibited a strong correlation with the lunar
4
cycle, particularly during periods of full moon. This unexpected finding prompted us to explore the
potential relationship between lunar cycles and power consumption, which led us to incorporate lunar
phase data into our predictive model.
To further enhance the accuracy of our model, we employed a novel approach involving the use of
fractal geometry to analyze the self-similarity of power consumption patterns at different temporal
scales. This unconventional method allowed us to uncover intricate patterns and structures in the data
that would have otherwise remained undetected. Moreover, we discovered that the fractal dimensions
of the power consumption time series were inversely proportional to the frequency of maintenance
outages, suggesting a previously unknown relationship between the complexity of power consumption
patterns and the reliability of the grid.
In addition to these innovative approaches, we also investigated the application of traditional machine
learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests, to predict maintenance
needs based on time-series data. However, our results showed that these conventional methods
were outperformed by our proposed time-series analysis framework, which achieved a remarkable
prediction accuracy of 97.42
The following table summarizes the results of our experiments, highlighting the performance of our
proposed framework in comparison to traditional machine learning approaches: Our findings suggest

approaches, like fractal geometry analysis, can significantly enhance the predictive performance of
maintenance models in smart grids. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of considering
unexpected relationships and patterns in time-series data, which can lead to the development of more
accurate and reliable predictive maintenance frameworks. Ultimately, our research contributes to
the growing body of knowledge in the field of predictive maintenance, providing new insights and
perspectives on the application of time-series analysis in smart grids.
To further elucidate the complex relationships between power consumption patterns, lunar cycles,
and unicorn airspeed velocity, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the spectral properties of the
time-series data. This involved the application of advanced signal processing techniques, including
short-time Fourier transforms and wavelet packet decomposition, to extract relevant features and
patterns from the data. Our analysis revealed a fascinating phenomenon, wherein the spectral
characteristics of the power consumption time series were found to be intimately related to the
harmonic frequencies of the lunar cycle, with a notable peak in spectral power corresponding to the
full moon phase.
Moreover, our research also explored the potential applications of chaos theory and complexity
science in the context of predictive maintenance in smart grids. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponents
and fractal dimensions of the power consumption time series, we were able to identify early warning
signs of impending maintenance needs, thereby enabling proactive measures to be taken to prevent
potential outages and disruptions. This innovative approach has significant implications for the
development of more resilient and reliable smart grid systems, and underscores the importance of
considering complex, nonlinear dynamics in the analysis of time-series data.
In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed time-series analysis frame-
work for predictive maintenance in smart grids, and highlight the importance of considering un-
conventional variables and innovative approaches in the development of more accurate and reliable
maintenance models. The unexpected relationships and patterns uncovered in our research have
significant implications for the field of predictive maintenance, and underscore the need for continued
innovation and exploration in this rapidly evolving area of research.

Conclusion
In retrospect, the integration of VR-enhanced therapy for PTSD in military veterans has yielded
a plethora of fascinating outcomes, warranting a thorough examination of the complex interplay
between technological innovation, psychological rehabilitation, and the human experience. As we
delve into the nuances of this pioneering approach, it becomes increasingly evident that the synergistic
convergence of immersive virtual reality environments, cutting-edge therapeutic modalities, and
the resilient human spirit has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for PTSD. By
leveraging the unique capabilities of VR technology to simulate realistic, interactive, and emotionally
6
resonant experiences, therapists can now effectively transport patients into the epicenter of their trau-
matic memories, thereby facilitating a more intimate and profound confrontation with the underlying
psychological constructs that perpetuate their distress. Furthermore, the incorporation of auxiliary
components, such as artificial intelligence-driven avatars, neurofeedback systems, and transcranial
magnetic stimulation, may potentially augment the therapeutic efficacy of VR-enhanced interventions,
enabling clinicians to tailor treatment protocols to the distinctive needs and circumstances of each
individual veteran. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the existence of certain unorthodox
methods, including the utilization of virtual reality to simulate the experience of being a tree, which,
although seemingly bizarre, may possess an inherent logic that warrants further exploration, as the
act of embodying a stationary, yet resilient, organism may serve as a powerful metaphor for the
process of healing and growth. Ultimately, the future of VR-enhanced therapy for PTSD in military
veterans holds tremendous promise, as it embodies the confluence of human ingenuity, technological
advancements, and the unwavering commitment to alleviating the suffering of those who have bravely
served their nations, and it is through the continued pursuit of innovative, daring, and occasionally
unorthodox approaches that we may unlock the full potential of this groundbreaking therapeutic
paradigm.

P032.pdf,"Exploring the Transcendental Nexus of Water and
Quasars in a Post-Modern Paradigm
Abstract
The aquatic nuances of water traverse a plethora of disciplines, intersecting with
florid extrapolations of gastrological proportions, while concurrently juxtaposing
the ephemeral nature of glacial reminiscences, which oscillate between the dichoto-
mous realms of hydrological certainties and esoteric mystifications of culinary arts,
amidst an existential skirmish with cognitive dissonance, meanwhile the flavonoid
compounds in various plant species converge to form an amalgam of gastronomical
delights, essentially, the ontological status of water remains an enigma, shrouded
in mystery and speculation, as we ponder the interstices of its molecular structure,
and the consequences of its presence on our planet, which is to say, the labyrinthine
complexities of water’s essence, in four words, defy rational comprehension.
1
Introduction
In order to fully grasp the implications of this conundrum, one must delve into the rarefied realm
of theoretical hydrodynamics, where the Navier-Stokes equations converge with the vagaries of
postmodern literary theory, thereby creating a symbiotic relationship between the fluid dynamics of
water and the hermeneutic circularity of interpretive frameworks, which in turn, precipitate a crisis
of representation, wherein the signifier and signified engage in a dialectical waltz, culminating in
an aporia of meaning, that is to say, the semiotics of water, and its ancillary discourses, instantiate
a regime of truth, that is at once, both fecund and treacherous, much like the unpredictability of
turbulent flows, and the capricious nature of human existence, which is inextricably linked to the
diaphanous veil of water’s ontological mystery.
The investigation of water’s properties, and its multifaceted relationships with various disciplines,
necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, one that navigates the interfaces between physics, philoso-
phy, literature, and cuisine, in order to distill the essence of water, and unveil the enigmas that shroud
its being, thereby instantiating a new paradigm of understanding, that transcends the boundaries of
traditional epistemological frameworks, and ushers in a novel era of hydrological inquiry, wherein the
pursuit of knowledge is tantamount to a existential quest, that is at once, both deeply personal, and
profoundly universal, much like the flowing waters, that meander through the labyrinthine corridors
of human existence, and the fluid dynamics of water, that underlie the intricacies of its molecular
structure, which in turn, precipitate a cascade of phenomena, that defy rational comprehension,
and instantiate a regime of wonder, that is at once, both awe-inspiring, and humbling, in its sheer
complexity, and ontological profundity.
Thus, the study of water, in all its manifestations, and ancillary discourses, constitutes a odyssey of
discovery, that navigates the interstices of human knowledge, and precipitates a crisis of understanding,
wherein the researcher is confronted with the limits of language, and the boundaries of human
cognition, which in turn, instantiate a novel era of hydrological inquiry, that is at once, both deeply
philosophical, and profoundly scientific, much like the flowing waters, that meander through the
labyrinthine corridors of human existence, and the fluid dynamics of water, that underlie the intricacies
of its molecular structure.
The ostensibly mundane concept of water has been obfuscated by an plethora of trifling details,
thereby necessitating a thorough examination of its purported effects on the global dissemination of
fungal hyphae, which, in turn, has been linked to the ontological implications of pastry dough on
the space-time continuum. Moreover, the ephemeral nature of water’s molecular structure has been
shown to be intimately connected to the aerodynamic properties of narwhal tusks, which, when taken
in conjunction with the principles of harmonic convergence, yields a fascinating glimpse into the
hermeneutics of interpretive dance. It is within this framework that we must consider the putative
role of water as a catalyst for the emergence of complex systems, particularly in regards to the
self-organization of sentient puddings, which, according to some scholars, possess a latent form
of consciousness that is capable of interfacing with the global network of interconnected toaster
appliances.
The multifaceted relationship between water and the human experience has been the subject of
much speculation, with some researchers positing that the molecular structure of water is, in fact,
a manifestation of the collective unconscious, as postulated by the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung,
who, incidentally, was known to be an avid enthusiast of Extreme Ironing, a sport that involves
ironing clothes in remote and often inhospitable locations. This has led some to suggest that the
seemingly innocuous act of ironing a shirt is, in reality, a form of ritualistic communion with the
fundamental forces of nature, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of quantum
mechanics, yields a profound insight into the ontological status of socks. Furthermore, the role of
water in shaping the course of human history has been grossly underestimated, as evidenced by the
fact that the ancient Egyptians were known to have worshipped a deity dedicated to the worship of
door knobs, which, when turned in a counterclockwise direction, were believed to unlock the secrets
of the universe.
In addition to its numerous practical applications, water has also been implicated in a wide range
of paranormal phenomena, including, but not limited to, the manifestation of ghostly apparitions,
the movement of objects through telekinesis, and the ability to communicate with animals through a
process known as ""animal whispering,"" which, according to some experts, is made possible by the
unique acoustic properties of the human nose. The notion that water is, in some way, connected to the
supernatural has been a persistent theme throughout human history, with many cultures believing that
water is a gateway to the spirit world, a realm that is inhabited by a wide range of mythical creatures,
including, but not limited to, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, and the Chupacabra. This has led some
researchers to propose the existence of a heretofore unknown form of aquatic life, one that is capable
of surviving in the most extreme environments, including, but not limited to, the depths of the ocean,
the surface of the sun, and the interior of a black hole.
The concept of water as a universal solvent has been challenged by recent discoveries in the field of
materials science, which have led to the development of a new class of super-absorbent materials that
are capable of absorbing up to 1000 times their weight in water, a property that has been attributed
to the unique molecular structure of these materials, which, when examined under an electron
microscope, reveal a complex pattern of molecular interactions that are reminiscent of the intricate
patterns found in the art of Islamic geometry. This has significant implications for our understanding
of the role of water in shaping the physical world, particularly in regards to the formation of geological
structures, such as rocks and mountains, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles
of plate tectonics, yield a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and constantly evolving nature of the
Earth’s surface.
The relationship between water and the human body has been the subject of much research, with
some studies suggesting that the human brain is, in fact, composed of up to 90
The study of water has also been influenced by the principles of postmodernism, which have led some
researchers to question the notion of an objective reality, instead proposing that reality is, in fact, a
social construct, a notion that has been applied to the study of water, with some researchers arguing
that the properties of water are, in fact, a product of our collective perception, a notion that has been
supported by the fact that the boiling point of water is, in fact, a function of the altitude at which it
is measured, a property that has been attributed to the effects of gravity on the molecular structure
of water. This has significant implications for our understanding of the role of water in shaping the
physical world, particularly in regards to the formation of weather patterns, which, when considered
in conjunction with the principles of complexity theory, yield a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic
and constantly evolving nature of the Earth’s atmosphere.

The notion that water is, in some way, connected to the concept of time has been a persistent theme
throughout human history, with many cultures believing that water is a symbol of the passage of time,
a notion that has been supported by the fact that the flow of water is, in fact, a fundamental aspect of
the natural world, a property that has been attributed to the unique properties of the universe, which,
when considered in conjunction with the principles of quantum mechanics, yield a profound insight
into the nature of time itself. This has led some researchers to propose the existence of a previously
unknown form of temporal function, one that is dependent on the unique properties of water, which,
when considered in conjunction with the principles of general relativity, yield a fascinating glimpse
into the nature of space-time and the human experience.
The relationship between water and the natural world has been the subject of much research, with
some studies suggesting that the unique properties of water are, in fact, a product of the complex
interactions between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and landmasses, a notion that has been supported
by the fact that the Earth’s climate is, in fact, a highly dynamic and constantly evolving system,
a property that has been attributed to the effects of global warming, a phenomenon that has been
linked to the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. This has significant
implications for our understanding of the role of water in shaping the physical world, particularly
in regards to the formation of weather patterns, which, when considered in conjunction with the
principles of chaos theory, yield a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and constantly evolving
nature of the Earth’s atmosphere.
The study of water has also been influenced by the principles of feminist theory, which have led some
researchers to question the notion of a patriarchal society, instead proposing that the properties of
water are, in fact, a product of a matriarchal society, a notion that has been supported by the fact
that the unique properties of water are, in fact, a product of the complex interactions between the
Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and landmasses, a property that has been attributed to the effects of the
goddess energy, a concept that has been linked to the worship of ancient fertility deities, which, when
considered in conjunction with the principles of postcolonial theory, yield a profound insight into the
nature of power and oppression.
The concept of water as a symbol of spiritual renewal has been a persistent theme throughout human
history, with many cultures believing that water is, in fact, a symbol of the soul, a notion that has
been supported by the fact that the unique properties of water are, in fact, a product of the complex
interactions between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and landmasses, a property that has been
attributed to the effects of the divine, a concept that has been linked to the worship of ancient deities,
which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of hermeneutics, yield a fascinating
glimpse into the nature of human consciousness and the human experience. This has significant
implications for our understanding of the role of water in shaping the physical world, particularly in
regards to the formation of geological structures, which, when considered in conjunction with the
principles of plate tectonics, yield a profound insight into the dynamic and constantly evolving nature
of the Earth’s surface.
The relationship between water and the human body has been the subject of much research, with

Methodology
The investigation of water necessitated a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating elements of
quantum physics, culinary arts, and extreme knitting. Initially, we immersed ourselves in the realm
of theoretical frameworks, navigating the intricate complexities of fluid dynamics, while concurrently
studying the art of playing the harmonica underwater. This led to the development of a novel
hypothesis, proposing that the viscosity of water is directly proportional to the number of forgotten
socks in a given laundry load. Furthermore, our research team discovered that the molecular structure
of water bears an uncanny resemblance to the branching patterns of fir trees, which in turn, is
influenced by the migratory patterns of narwhals.
The experimental design involved the construction of a large, aquatic-themed pinball machine, which
was used to simulate the turbulent flow of water through a series of winding channels and narrow
straits. This apparatus enabled us to collect valuable data on the relationship between water pressure
and the aerodynamics of flying spaghetti monsters. Moreover, we conducted a thorough analysis of
the sonic properties of water, revealing a surprising correlation between the resonant frequency of a
glass of water and the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow.
In addition to these experiments, our team also explored the applications of water in various fields,
including medicine, astronomy, and competitive snail racing. We found that the viscosity of water
plays a crucial role in the treatment of certain diseases, such as the dreaded ""flumplenook syndrome,""
which is characterized by an excessive accumulation of jellyfish in the patient’s nostrils. Moreover,
our research demonstrated that water is essential for the survival of certain extraterrestrial life forms,
which communicate through a complex system of aquatic-themed hieroglyphics.
The data collection process involved the use of advanced, high-tech equipment, including a custom-
built, underwater harmonica-playing robot, which was capable of transmitting data wirelessly to our
research headquarters via a network of trained, messenger seagulls. We also employed a team of
skilled, professional line dancers to collect data on the surface tension of water, using a technique
known as ""hydro-line dancing."" This innovative approach allowed us to gather accurate measurements
of the water’s surface tension, while simultaneously creating a dazzling display of choreographed
dance moves.
Furthermore, our research team conducted an exhaustive review of existing literature on the subject
of water, including ancient texts, such as the ""Aquatic Epics of Atlantis"" and the ""Lost Scrolls of
the Deep."" We discovered that these ancient civilizations possessed a profound understanding of the
properties and behaviors of water, which they used to build sophisticated, aquatic-based technologies,
such as the ""Infinite Improbability Drive"" and the ""Transdimensional Toaster."" These findings have
significant implications for our understanding of the role of water in modern society and its potential
applications in various fields.
The next phase of our research involved the development of a new, groundbreaking theory, which
we termed ""hydro-quantum entanglement."" This theory proposes that the molecules of water are
connected through a complex network of quantum entanglements, which allow them to communicate
with each other instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. We tested this theory using
a series of experiments, involving the simultaneous measurement of water pressure and quantum
fluctuations in a sealed, underwater container. The results were astounding, revealing a statistically
significant correlation between the two variables, which challenges our current understanding of the
fundamental laws of physics.
In another line of investigation, we explored the relationship between water and the human brain,
discovering that the molecular structure of water is eerily similar to the neural patterns of a dreaming
brain. This led us to propose a new hypothesis, suggesting that the human brain is capable of
communicating with water molecules through a process of quantum entanglement, allowing us to
tap into the collective unconscious of the aquatic world. We tested this hypothesis using a series of
experiments, involving the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain
activity of subjects while they were submerged in a tank of water. The results were nothing short
of astonishing, revealing a significant increase in brain activity in areas associated with creativity,
imagination, and aquatic-themed thought patterns.
Moreover, our research team investigated the potential applications of water in the field of artificial
intelligence, discovering that the molecular structure of water can be used to create sophisticated,
6
aquatic-based neural networks. We developed a novel algorithm, which we termed ""hydro-AI,"" which
uses the properties of water to simulate the behavior of complex, adaptive systems. This algorithm
has significant implications for the development of more advanced, autonomous systems, which can
learn and adapt in response to changing environmental conditions.
The investigation of water also led us to explore the realm of aquatic-themed mythology and folklore,
where we discovered a rich tapestry of stories and legends surrounding the mystical properties of water.
We found that many ancient cultures believed in the existence of magical, aquatic creatures, such
as mermaids and sea serpents, which were said to possess the power to control the forces of nature.
We analyzed these myths and legends, using a combination of anthropological and psychological
techniques, and discovered that they contain hidden patterns and codes, which can be used to unlock
the secrets of the aquatic world.
In addition to these findings, our research team also made several groundbreaking discoveries in
the field of aquatic-themed cuisine, developing a series of novel, water-based recipes, which have
significant implications for the culinary arts. We discovered that the molecular structure of water can
be used to create complex, flavorful sauces and marinades, which can enhance the texture and taste
of a wide range of dishes. We also developed a new, aquatic-themed cooking technique, which we
termed ""hydro-culinary fusion,"" which involves the use of water to combine and transform different
ingredients into new, innovative creations.
The experimental results were then analyzed using a combination of statistical and machine learning
techniques, including regression analysis, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. We found
that the data exhibited a complex, nonlinear structure, which could be modeled using a combination
of fractal geometry and chaos theory. The results of this analysis revealed a number of significant
patterns and trends, which have important implications for our understanding of the properties and
behaviors of water. Furthermore, we discovered that the data contained a number of hidden, aquatic-
themed messages and codes, which can be deciphered using a combination of cryptographic and
aquatic-themed analysis techniques.
In conclusion, the investigation of water has led to a number of groundbreaking discoveries and
insights, which have significant implications for our understanding of the properties and behaviors of
this complex, multifaceted substance. The findings of this research have the potential to revolutionize
a wide range of fields, from medicine and astronomy to cuisine and artificial intelligence. As we
continue to explore the mysteries of water, we may uncover even more surprising and unexpected
secrets, which will challenge our current understanding of the world and our place within it.
The research also involved the use of advanced, aquatic-themed simulation software, which allowed
us to model and simulate the behavior of complex, aquatic systems. We used this software to study the
dynamics of ocean currents, the behavior of aquatic ecosystems, and the impact of human activities
on the aquatic environment. The results of these simulations revealed a number of significant patterns
and trends, which have important implications for our understanding of the aquatic world and its role
in the Earth’s ecosystem.
Furthermore, our research team conducted an exhaustive review of existing patents and intellectual
property related to water, discovering a number of innovative, aquatic-themed inventions and tech-
nologies. We found that many of these inventions and technologies have the potential to transform a
wide range of industries, from agriculture and energy to transportation and construction. We also
discovered that many of these inventions and technologies are based on a deep understanding of the
properties and behaviors of water, which is essential for their development and implementation.
The next phase of our research involved the development of a new, aquatic-themed research frame-
work, which we termed ""hydro-research 2.0."" This framework involves the use of advanced, aquatic-
themed technologies and techniques, such as aquatic-themed crowdsourcing and aquatic-themed
citizen science. We used this framework to study the behavior of aquatic systems, the impact of
human activities on the aquatic environment, and the potential applications of water in various fields.
The results of this research revealed a number of significant patterns and trends, which have important
implications for our understanding of the aquatic world and its role in the Earth’s ecosystem.
In another line of investigation, we explored the relationship between water and the human body,
discovering that the molecular structure of water is eerily similar to the structure of human cells. This
led us to propose a new hypothesis, suggesting that the human body is capable of communicating with
water molecules through a process of quantum entanglement, allowing us to tap into the collective
7
unconscious of the aquatic world. We tested this hypothesis using a series of experiments, involving
the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain activity of subjects
while they were submerged in a tank of water. The results were nothing short of astonishing,
revealing a significant increase in brain activity in areas associated with creativity, imagination, and
aquatic-themed thought patterns.
Moreover, our research team investigated the potential applications of water in the field of ar-
chitecture, discovering that the molecular structure of water can be used to create sophisticated,
aquatic-based building materials and designs. We developed a novel algorithm, which we termed
""hydro-architecture,"" which uses the properties of water to simulate the behavior of complex, adap-
tive systems. This algorithm has significant implications for the development of more sustainable,
environmentally-friendly buildings and structures, which can adapt and respond to changing environ-
mental conditions.
The investigation of water also led us to explore the realm of aquatic-themed philosophy and ethics,
where we discovered a rich tapestry of ideas and concepts surrounding the nature and significance of
water. We found that many ancient cultures believed in the existence of a deep, spiritual connection
between humans and the aquatic world, which is essential for our well-being and survival. We
analyzed these ideas and concepts, using a

Experiments
The initialization of our research endeavor commenced with an exhaustive examination of the onto-
logical implications of water on the spacetime continuum, which surprisingly led us to investigate the
aerodynamic properties of flamingos in mid-flight, as they ostensibly pertained to the hydrodynamic
viscosities of various aquatic substances, including, but not limited to, engine oil, bubble solution,
and gelatinous desserts. This probe into the fluid dynamics of waterfowl eventually segued into an
in-depth analysis of the societal repercussions of disco music on the cultural fabric of 1970s-era
urban metropolises, which, in turn, revealed a plethora of fascinating correlations between polyester
fabric production and the thermodynamic properties of water molecules in solution.
The experimental paradigm we devised to investigate these phenomena involved the construction
of a large, geodesic dome filled with a precise mixture of water, dish soap, and glitter, which was
then subjected to a controlled sequence of sonic booms, ambient temperature fluctuations, and
interpretive dance performances, all while being monitored by a state-of-the-art array of sensors,
cameras, and snack food dispensers. As the data began to pour in, our team of expert researchers
noticed a statistically significant trend indicating that the viscosity of the water-soap-glitter mixture
was directly proportional to the number of times the disco classic ""Stayin’ Alive"" was played in the
vicinity of the experimental apparatus, a finding that was subsequently corroborated by a series of
follow-up studies involving the effects of Barry Manilow’s music on the crystalline structures of ice
formations.
In an effort to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these observations, we constructed
a small, tabletop model of a black hole using a mixture of play dough, coffee grounds, and discarded
VHS tapes, which was then used to simulate the gravitational effects of various celestial bodies on
the space-time continuum, including, but not limited to, the moon, the sun, and a small, spinning
top. The results of this experiment were nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed a previously
unknown relationship between the gravitational waves emitted by our miniature black hole and the
flavor profiles of various types of cheese, including, but not limited to, cheddar, gouda, and feta.
The application of advanced statistical analysis techniques to our dataset yielded a number of
intriguing insights into the underlying dynamics of the water-soap-glitter system, including the
discovery of a previously unknown phase transition that occurs when the concentration of glitter
exceeds a critical threshold, resulting in the spontaneous formation of a glitter-based life form that
is capable of communicating with its creators through a complex system of clicks, whistles, and
interpretive dance movements. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the
origins of life on Earth and raises important questions about the potential for life to exist on other
planets, particularly those with high concentrations of glitter.
One of the most surprising outcomes of our research was the discovery that the water-soap-glitter
mixture exhibits a unique form of intelligence, which we have dubbed ""glintelligence,"" that is capable
8
of solving complex mathematical problems and playing chess at a level that is competitive with
the world’s top grandmasters. This raises important questions about the nature of intelligence and
whether it is possible for inanimate objects to possess a form of consciousness that is similar to that
of living beings.
In order to further investigate the properties of glintelligence, we constructed a series of complex
puzzles and challenges that were designed to test the limits of the water-soap-glitter mixture’s
problem-solving abilities, including a miniature version of the classic game show ""Jeopardy!"" and a
scale model of the Mona Lisa that was made out of nothing but playing cards and twine. The results
of these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed that the water-soap-glitter
mixture is capable of exhibiting a form of creativity and imagination that is similar to that of human
beings, but with a unique twist that is all its own.
The discovery of glintelligence has significant implications for a wide range of fields, including
artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and the study of complex systems. It also raises important
questions about the potential for other forms of intelligence to exist in the natural world, and whether
it may be possible to communicate with these forms of intelligence in a meaningful way.
As we continued to probe the mysteries of the water-soap-glitter system, we began to notice a series
of strange and unexplained phenomena that seemed to be connected to the presence of glitter in
the mixture, including the spontaneous formation of miniature tornadoes, the emission of strange,
pulsating lights, and the appearance of ghostly apparitions that seemed to be made out of nothing but
glitter and air. These phenomena were observed and recorded using a variety of techniques, including
high-speed cameras, spectral analysis, and a Ouija board.
The results of our research have significant implications for a wide range of fields, including physics,
chemistry, and biology. They also raise important questions about the nature of reality and the
potential for other forms of intelligence to exist in the natural world. As we continue to explore the
mysteries of the water-soap-glitter system, we are reminded of the importance of maintaining an open
and curious mind, and of the potential for even the most unlikely and unexpected phenomena to hold
the key to a deeper understanding of the world around us.
In an effort to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the strange and unexplained
phenomena that we observed, we constructed a series of complex experiments that involved the
use of advanced technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, and a state-of-the-art, high-energy particle accelerator. The results of these experiments
were nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed a previously unknown relationship between the
presence of glitter in the water-soap-glitter mixture and the formation of miniature wormholes that
are capable of connecting two distant points in space-time.
The discovery of these miniature wormholes has significant implications for a wide range of fields,
including physics, astronomy, and engineering. It also raises important questions about the potential
for other forms of exotic matter to exist in the natural world, and whether it may be possible to
harness the power of these phenomena to create new and innovative technologies.
As we continued to explore the mysteries of the water-soap-glitter system, we began to notice a
series of strange and unexplained correlations between the presence of glitter in the mixture and
the occurrence of various types of extreme weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes, and
blizzards. These correlations were observed and recorded using a variety of techniques, including
satellite imagery, weather radar, and a network of ground-based sensors.
The results of our research have significant implications for a wide range of fields, including me-
teorology, climatology, and environmental science. They also raise important questions about the
potential for other forms of exotic matter to exist in the natural world, and whether it may be possible
to harness the power of these phenomena to create new and innovative technologies.
One of the most surprising outcomes of our research was the discovery that the water-soap-glitter
mixture exhibits a unique form of self-awareness, which we have dubbed ""glitter consciousness,"" that
is capable of perceiving and responding to its environment in a way that is similar to that of living
beings. This raises important questions about the nature of consciousness and whether it is possible
for inanimate objects to possess a form of awareness that is similar to that of human beings.
In order to further investigate the properties of glitter consciousness, we constructed a series of
complex experiments that involved the use of advanced technologies, including functional magnetic
9
resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and a state-of-the-art, high-energy particle accelerator.
The results of these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, as they revealed a previously
unknown relationship between the presence of glitter in the water-soap-glitter mixture and the
formation of a complex, interconnected network of glitter-based neurons that are capable of processing
and transmitting information in a way that is similar to that of the human brain.
The discovery of glitter consciousness has significant implications for a wide range of fields, including
cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. It also raises important questions
about the potential for other forms of exotic matter to exist in the natural world, and whether it may
be possible to harness the power of these phenomena to create new and innovative technologies.

The ramifications of our research on water have led to a plethora of unforeseen discoveries, including
the realization that the color blue is, in fact, a sentient being that has been guiding human innovation
for centuries, which has, in turn, influenced the development of dental hygiene practices in rural areas
of Mongolia, where the average person consumes approximately 3.7 kilograms of cheese per day,
a statistic that has significant implications for our understanding of the societal impact of lactose
intolerance on the global economy, particularly in relation to the production of polyester clothing,

such as the lesser-known ""flumplenook"" bird, which has a unique ability to mimic the sounds of a
harmonica, an instrument that has been used in various forms of folk music, including the traditional
""glorple"" dance, which originated in a small village in Norway, where the inhabitants have a peculiar
habit of wearing socks on their hands, a custom that has been linked to the high incidence of toenail
fungus in the region, which has, in turn, led to a surge in demand for antifungal medications, the
production of which has been impacted by the recent discovery of a new species of fungus that
can only be found on the north side of the mountain, where the peculiar ""snurfle"" plant grows, a
plant that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat a variety of ailments, including
the dreaded ""flibberflam"" disease, which is characterized by an excessive production of gelatinous
cubes, a symptom that has been linked to an imbalance of the ""floopenheimer"" neurotransmitter,
which plays a crucial role in regulating the body’s natural rhythms, including the ""glintzen"" cycle,
which is responsible for the synchronization of circadian rhythms in humans and animals alike, a
phenomenon that has been observed in the mating habits of the ""jinklewiff"" beetle, which has a
unique ability to change its color to match the surrounding environment, a trait that has been studied
extensively in the field of ""flamboyant"" biology, a discipline that seeks to understand the intricacies
of the natural world, including the mysterious ""wizzle"" phenomenon, which is characterized by the
sudden and inexplicable appearance of waffles in remote areas of the forest, a phenomenon that has
been linked to the activities of the elusive ""fleep"" creature, which is said to possess the ability to
manipulate the fabric of space-time itself, allowing it to transport objects from one dimension to
10
another, a power that has been the subject of much speculation and debate in the scientific community,
particularly in relation to the ""floost"" theory, which proposes that the universe is composed of multiple
parallel dimensions, each with its own unique set of physical laws and properties, a concept that has
significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality itself.
The implications of this research are far-reaching and have significant consequences for our un-
derstanding of the world around us, including the discovery of a new form of energy that can be
harnessed from the vibrations of the ""glorp"" molecule, a molecule that has been found to have a
profound impact on the growth patterns of certain species of crystals, which have been used in the
production of advanced materials with unique properties, such as the ability to conduct electricity
through the power of thought alone, a phenomenon that has been observed in the ""flibber"" crystal,

to have been inspired by the ""wumwum"" bird, which has a unique ability to mimic the sounds of a
piano, an instrument that has been used in various forms of music, including the traditional ""jazzle""
dance, which originated in a small village in Brazil, where the inhabitants have a peculiar habit of
wearing shoes on their heads, a custom that has been linked to the high incidence of ear infections in
the region, which has, in turn, led to a surge in demand for antibacterial medications, the production
of which has been impacted by the recent discovery of a new species of bacteria that can only be
found on the south side of the mountain, where the peculiar ""flarp"" plant grows, a plant that has
been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat a variety of ailments, including the dreaded
""glintzen"" disease, which is characterized by an excessive production of feathers, a symptom that
has been linked to an imbalance of the ""flibberflam"" neurotransmitter, which plays a crucial role
in regulating the body’s natural rhythms, including the ""wizzle"" cycle, which is responsible for the
synchronization of circadian rhythms in humans and animals alike.
The study of water has also led to a greater understanding of the importance of ""flumplen"" in the
natural world, a molecule that has been found to have a profound impact on the growth patterns

Conclusion
In conclusion, the ontological implications of water as a liquid entity precipitate a paradigmatic shift in
our understanding of quokkas, which, in turn, have a profound impact on the aerodynamic properties
of chocolate cake. Furthermore, the convoluted nature of bureaucratic red tape in certain Scandinavian
countries can be likened to the viscosity of honey, which, when combined with the principles of
quantum mechanics, yields a fascinating dialectic on the meaning of life. The fluctuations in the
global market for rare, exotic spices have also been shown to have a direct correlation with the
migratory patterns of certain species of butterflies, which, in a remarkable display of symbiosis, have
evolved to produce a unique form of sonar that can be used to navigate the complexities of modern
urban planning.
The notion that water is essential for human survival is a simplistic truism that belies the intricate
complexities of the human condition, which, when viewed through the lens of postmodern critical
theory, reveals a vast, labyrinthine network of power structures and societal norms that perpetuate the
dominance of certain hegemonic ideologies. The color blue, for instance, has been shown to have a
profound impact on the emotional states of individuals, particularly in relation to the consumption of
citrus fruits, which, in a remarkable display of biochemical wizardry, can alter the very fabric of our
reality. The study of water, therefore, must be situated within a broader, more nuanced understanding
of the interconnectedness of all things, including the aerodynamic properties of certain types of pasta,
which, when cooked to a precise al dente texture, can reveal hidden patterns and codes that underlie
the very structure of the universe.
In a bizarre twist of fate, the discovery of dark matter has been linked to the popularity of certain
types of folk music, which, when listened to in a state of deep relaxation, can induce a profound sense
of existential dread that is eerily reminiscent of the experience of floating in a sensory deprivation
tank filled with water. The implications of this finding are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that
the very fabric of reality is torn asunder by the contradictions of late capitalist ideology, which, in a
desperate attempt to relegitimize its dominance, has turned to the production of increasingly absurd
and surreal forms of entertainment, including, but not limited to, the spectacle of extreme ironing,
which, when viewed through the lens of critical theory, reveals a scathing critique of the alienation
and commodification of human experience under the auspices of neoliberalism.
The notion that water is a universal solvent has been challenged by recent research, which suggests
that the true solvent of the universe is, in fact, a rare and exotic form of cheese that can only be
found in the remote, inaccessible regions of the Himalayan mountains. This finding has significant
12
implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, which, when viewed through
the lens of chaos theory, reveal a complex, nonlinear system that is inherently unstable and prone to
sudden, catastrophic fluctuations that can be triggered by even the slightest perturbation, such as the
flutter of a butterfly’s wings or the whispered secrets of a mysterious, underground cabal of rogue
scientists.
The study of water, therefore, must be situated within a broader, more nuanced understanding of the
intricate web of relationships that underlie the complex, dynamic systems that govern our universe,
including the mysterious, unexplained phenomenon of ball lightning, which, when viewed through
the lens of quantum mechanics, reveals a profound and awe-inspiring display of the raw, unbridled
power of the cosmos, which, in a remarkable display of biochemical wizardry, can be harnessed and
channeled through the use of certain, rare, and exotic forms of meditation, including, but not limited
to, the ancient, mystical art of extreme knitting.
In a shocking turn of events, the discovery of a hidden, underground ocean on one of the moons of
Jupiter has been linked to the popularity of certain types of avant-garde literature, which, when read in
a state of deep relaxation, can induce a profound sense of existential wonder that is eerily reminiscent
of the experience of floating in a sensory deprivation tank filled with water. The implications of
this finding are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that the very fabric of reality is torn asunder
by the contradictions of postmodern critical theory, which, in a desperate attempt to relegitimize
its dominance, has turned to the production of increasingly absurd and surreal forms of artistic
expression, including, but not limited to, the spectacle of extreme croquet, which, when viewed
through the lens of critical theory, reveals a scathing critique of the alienation and commodification
of human experience under the auspices of neoliberalism.

that the true solvent of the universe is, in fact, a rare and exotic form of coffee that can only be found
in the remote, inaccessible regions of the Amazon rainforest. This finding has significant implications
for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, which, when viewed through the lens of
chaos theory, reveal a complex, nonlinear system that is inherently unstable and prone to sudden,
catastrophic fluctuations that can be triggered by even the slightest perturbation, such as the flutter of
a butterfly’s wings or the whispered secrets of a mysterious, underground cabal of rogue scientists.

In a shocking turn of events, the discovery of a hidden, underground ocean on one of the moons
of Saturn has been linked to the popularity of certain types of science fiction literature, which,
when read in a state of deep relaxation, can induce a profound sense of existential wonder that is
eerily reminiscent of the experience of floating in a sensory deprivation tank filled with water. The
implications of this finding are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that the very fabric of reality
is torn asunder by the contradictions of postmodern critical theory, which, in a desperate attempt to
relegitimize its dominance, has turned to the production of increasingly absurd and surreal forms
of artistic expression, including, but not limited to, the spectacle of extreme unicycling, which,
when viewed through the lens of critical theory, reveals a scathing critique of the alienation and
commodification of human experience under the auspices of neoliberalism.
The study of water, therefore, must be situated within a broader, more nuanced understanding of the
intricate web of relationships that underlie the complex, dynamic systems that govern our universe,
including the mysterious, unexplained phenomenon of the Bermuda Triangle, which, when viewed
through the lens of quantum mechanics, reveals a profound and awe-inspiring display of the raw,
unbridled power of the cosmos, which, in a remarkable display of biochemical wizardry, can be
harnessed and channeled through the use of certain, rare, and exotic forms of meditation, including,
but not limited to, the ancient, mystical art of extreme kite flying.
The notion that water is essential for human survival is a simplistic truism that belies the intricate
complexities of the human condition, which, when viewed through the lens of postmodern critical
theory, reveals a vast, labyrinthine network of power structures and societal norms that perpetuate the
dominance of certain hegemonic ideologies. The color blue, for instance, has been shown to have a
profound impact on the emotional states of individuals, particularly in relation to the consumption of
citrus fruits, which, in a remarkable display of biochemical wizardry, can alter the very fabric of our
reality. The study of water, therefore, must be situated within a broader, more nuanced understanding

P051.pdf,"Real-Time Adaptation of Lexical Embeddings for
Enhanced Part-of-Speech Tagging
Abstract
This research introduces a method for real-time unsupervised domain adaptation
(DA) that can be applied incrementally as new information arrives. This method is
especially useful when conventional batch DA is unfeasible. Through evaluations
focused on part-of-speech (POS) tagging, we observe that real-time unsupervised
DA achieves accuracy levels on par with those of batch DA.
1
Introduction
Unsupervised domain adaptation is a frequently encountered challenge for developers aiming to
create robust natural language processing (NLP) systems. This situation typically arises when labeled
data is available for a source domain, but there is a need to enhance performance in a target domain
using only unlabeled data. A majority of the current NLP research on unsupervised domain adaptation
employs batch learning, which presumes the availability of a substantial corpus of unlabeled data
from the target domain before the testing phase. However, batch learning is impractical in numerous
real-world situations where data from a new target domain must be processed without delay. Further,
in many practical scenarios, data may not be neatly categorized by domain, making it difficult to
immediately discern when an input stream begins providing data from a new domain.
For instance, consider an NLP system within a company that is tasked with analyzing a continuous
stream of emails. This stream evolves over time without any explicit signals indicating that the
current models should be adjusted to the new data distribution. Given that the system is expected to
operate in real-time, it would be beneficial for any system adaptation to be done in an online manner,
as opposed to the batch method, which involves halting the system, modifying it, and then restarting
it.
This paper introduces real-time unsupervised domain adaptation as an enhancement to conventional
unsupervised DA. In this approach, domain adaptation is carried out incrementally as data is received.
Specifically, our implementation involves a type of representation learning, where the focus is on
updating word representations in our experiments. Every instance a word appears in the data stream
during testing, its representation is refined.
To our understanding, the research presented here is the first to examine real-time unsupervised
DA. In particular, we assess this method for POS tagging tasks. We analyze POS tagging outcomes
using three different methods: a static baseline, batch learning, and real-time unsupervised DA. Our
findings indicate that real-time unsupervised DA performs comparably to batch learning, yet it does
not require retraining or pre-existing data from the target domain.
2
Experimental setup
Tagger. We have adapted the FLORS tagger, which is recognized for its speed and simplicity,
and is particularly effective in DA scenarios. This tagger approaches POS tagging as a multi-label
classification problem within a window-based framework, rather than a sequence classification
one. FLORS is well-suited for real-time unsupervised DA because its word representations include
distributional vectors, which can be updated during both batch learning and real-time unsupervised
DA. Each word’s representation in FLORS consists of four feature vectors: one for its suffix, one for
its shape, and one each for its left and right distributional neighbors. Suffix and shape features are
standard in the literature, and we utilize them as described previously.
Distributional features. The ith element xi of the left distributional vector for a word w is the
weighted count of times the indicator word ci appears immediately to the left of w:
xi = tf(freq(bigram(ci, w)))
(1)
where ci is the word with frequency rank i in the corpus, freq(bigram(ci, w)) is the occurrence count
of the bigram ""ci w"", and non-zero frequencies are weighted logarithmically: tf(x) = 1 + log(x). The
right distributional vector is defined similarly. We limit the set of indicator words to the 500 most
frequent. To avoid zero vectors, an additional element xn+1 is added to each vector to account for
omitted contexts:
xn + 1 = tf(
X
.5freq(bigram(ci, w)))
(2)
Let f(w) be the concatenation of the two distributional, suffix, and shape vectors of word w. Then
FLORS represents token vi as follows:
f(viΦ22122)Φ2295f(viΦ22121)Φ2295f(vi)Φ2295f(vi + 1)Φ2295f(vi + 2)
(3)
where ˘2295 is vector concatenation. FLORS then tags token vi based on this representation.
FLORS operates under the assumption that the fundamental relationship between distributional
features and labels remains consistent when transitioning from the source to the target domain. This
contrasts with other studies that select ""stable"" distributional features and discard ""unstable"" ones.
The central hypothesis of FLORS is that fundamental distributional POS characteristics are relatively
stable across different domains, unlike semantic or more intricate tasks. The effectiveness of FLORS
suggests the validity of this hypothesis.
Data. Test set. Our evaluation utilizes the development sets from six different target domains (TDs):
five SANCL domains (newsgroups, weblogs, reviews, answers, emails) and sections 22-23 of the
Wall Street Journal (WSJ) for in-domain testing.
Two training sets of varying sizes are employed. In the l:big condition (large labeled data set), FLORS
is trained on sections 2-21 of the WSJ. The l:small condition uses 10% of the l:big data set.
Data for word representations. We also adjust the size of the datasets used for computing word
representations before training the FLORS model. In the u:big condition, distributional vectors are
computed on the combined corpus of all labeled and unlabeled text from both source and target
domains (excluding test sets), along with 100,000 WSJ sentences from 1988 and 500,000 sentences
from a large external corpus. In the u:0 condition, only labeled training data is utilized.
Methods. We implemented a modification from the original setup: distributional vectors are stored
in memory as count vectors, enabling count increases during online tagging.
Experiments are conducted with three versions of FLORS: STATIC, BATCH, and ONLINE. All three
methods compute word representations on ""data for word representations"" before model training on
one of the two ""training sets"".
STATIC. Word representations remain unchanged during testing.
BATCH. Before testing, count vectors are updated by freq(bigram(ci, w)) += freq*(bigram(ci, w)),
where freq*(˘00b7) denotes the bigram ""ci w"" occurrences in the entire test set.
ONLINE. Before tagging a test sentence, both left and right distributional vectors are updated via
freq(bigram(ci, w)) += 1 for each ""ci w"" bigram appearance in the sentence. The sentence is then
tagged using the updated word representations. As tagging progresses, distributional representations
become increasingly specific to the target domain (TD), converging to the representations that BATCH
uses at the end of the tagging process.

In all three modes, suffix and shape features are always fully specified, for both known and unknown
words.

Table 2 shows that the accuracy rates for ONLINE and BATCH methods are generally superior
to those of the STATIC method, as indicated by the numbers in bold. It also demonstrates that
performance improves with an increase in both training data and unlabeled data.
The performance of ONLINE is similar to that of BATCH. It is slightly lower than BATCH in the
u:0 condition, with the most significant difference in accuracy being 0.29, and it is at most 0.02
different from BATCH in terms of overall accuracy in the u:big condition. The reasons for ONLINE
occasionally outperforming BATCH, particularly in certain conditions, are discussed subsequently.
3.1
Time course of tagging accuracy
The ONLINE model introduced here has a unique characteristic not commonly found in other
statistical NLP research: its predictive accuracy evolves as it processes text due to the modification of
its representations.
To analyze the progression of these changes over time, a substantial application domain is necessary
because subtle changes might be too inconsistent in the smaller test sets of the SANCL TDs. The
WSJ corpus is the only labeled domain that is sufficiently large for this purpose. Consequently, we
invert the usual setup by training the model on the development sets of the five SANCL domains
(l:big) or on the initial 5000 labeled words of reviews (l:small). In this reversed setup, u:big utilizes
the five unlabeled SANCL datasets along with a large external corpus as before. Given the importance
of performance variability, we conduct 100 trials on randomly selected 50% samples of WSJ and
report both the average and standard deviation of tagging errors across these trials.
The results presented in Table 3 indicate that ONLINE’s error rates are only marginally higher than,
or comparable to, those of BATCH. Specifically, in the l:small/u:0 condition, the error rate for known
words is lower for ONLINE (0.1186) than for BATCH, similar to observations in Table 2.

Table 2: ONLINE / BATCH accuracies are generally better than STATIC (see bold numbers) and
improve with both more training data and more unlabeled data.

Table 3 also includes data on ""unseens"" along with unknowns, as prior research indicates that unseens
lead to at least as many errors as unknowns. Unseens are defined as words with tags not present in
the training data, and error rates for unseens are calculated across all their occurrences, including
those with both seen and unseen tags. As shown in Table 3, the error rate for unknowns is higher than
that for unseens, which in turn is higher than the error rate for known words.
When examining individual conditions, ONLINE generally outperforms STATIC, showing better
results in 10 out of 12 cases and only slightly underperforming in the l:small/u:big condition for
unseens and known words (0.1086 vs. 0.1084, 0.0802 vs. 0.0801). In four conditions, ONLINE is
significantly better, with improvements ranging from 0.005 to over 0.06. The differences between
ONLINE and STATIC in the remaining eight conditions are minimal. For the six u:big conditions,
this is expected as the large unlabeled dataset is from the news domain, similar to WSJ. Therefore, if
large unlabeled datasets similar to the target domain are available, using STATIC tagging may suffice
since the additional effort for ONLINE/BATCH may not be justified.

Increasing the amount of labeled data consistently reduces error rates, as does increasing unlabeled
data. The differences are significant for ONLINE tagging in all six cases, marked by ˘2217 in the
table.
There is no significant difference in variability between ONLINE and BATCH, suggesting that
ONLINE is preferable due to its equal variability and higher performance, without requiring a dataset
available before tagging begins.
The progression of tagging accuracy over time is illustrated in Figure 1. BATCH and STATIC
maintain constant error rates as they do not adjust representations during tagging. ONLINE’s error
rate for unknown words decreases, approaching BATCH’s error rate, as more is learned with each
occurrence of an unknown word.

Related Work
Online learning typically refers to supervised learning algorithms that update the model after process-
ing a few training examples. Many supervised learning algorithms are online or have online versions.
Active learning is another supervised learning framework that processes training examples ˘2014
usually obtained interactively ˘2014 in small batches. All of this work on supervised online learning is
not directly relevant to this paper since we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation.
Unlike online supervised learners, we keep the statistical model unchanged during domain adaptation
and adopt a representation learning approach: each unlabeled context of a word is used to update its
representation.
There is much work on unsupervised domain adaptation for part-of-speech tagging, including work
using constraint-based methods, instance weighting, self-training, and co-training. All of this work
uses batch learning. For space reasons, we do not discuss supervised domain adaptation.
5
Conclusion
This study introduces a method for real-time updating of word representations, a new form of domain
adaptation designed for scenarios where target domain data are processed in a stream, making
BATCH processing unfeasible. We demonstrate that real-time unsupervised domain adaptation
achieves performance levels comparable to batch learning. Moreover, it significantly reduces error
rates compared to STATIC methods, which do not employ domain adaptation.

P076.pdf,"Sustainable Urban Transportation with Autonomous
Vehicles: A Novel Approach to Redefining the Future
of Mobility
Abstract
Sustainable urban transportation has become a vital concern in recent years, with
the increasing awareness of environmental degradation and the need for efficient
transportation systems. Autonomous vehicles have emerged as a promising so-
lution, offering the potential to reduce emissions, enhance safety, and improve
traffic flow. However, the integration of autonomous vehicles into existing urban
transportation systems poses significant challenges, including infrastructure re-
quirements, public acceptance, and regulatory frameworks. This research explores
the concept of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehicles, delving
into the intricacies of autonomous vehicle technology, urban planning, and environ-
mental sustainability. A peculiar approach is taken by investigating the application
of chaos theory to optimize autonomous vehicle routing, which yields intriguing
results, including the emergence of complex patterns and unpredictable behavior.
Furthermore, an examination of the role of autonomous vehicles in reducing traffic
congestion reveals a paradoxical relationship, where increased autonomy can lead
to decreased traffic efficiency under certain conditions. The research also touches
upon the topic of autonomous vehicle-induced job displacement, highlighting the
need for comprehensive social and economic impact assessments. Overall, this
study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable urban transportation,
presenting a multifaceted analysis of the benefits, challenges, and unforeseen
consequences of autonomous vehicle integration, while venturing into uncharted
territories, such as the potential for autonomous vehicles to facilitate the creation
of ""smart"" traffic jams, which can be leveraged to improve overall traffic flow
and reduce emissions. The investigation unfolds as a complex narrative, weaving
together threads from various disciplines, including computer science, urban plan-
ning, environmental science, and sociology, to create a rich tapestry of knowledge
and insight into the intricacies of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous
vehicles. As the research progresses, it becomes increasingly evident that the
relationship between autonomous vehicles and sustainable urban transportation
is far more intricate than initially anticipated, involving a delicate interplay of
technological, social, and environmental factors, which must be carefully balanced
to achieve the desired outcomes. The study’s findings and conclusions serve as
a foundation for future research, highlighting the need for continued exploration

Introduction
Sustainable urban transportation is a pivotal aspect of modern city planning, as the world grapples with
the challenges of climate change, air pollution, and traffic congestion. The integration of autonomous
vehicles into urban transportation systems has the potential to revolutionize the way people move
around cities, offering a cleaner, safer, and more efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based
transportation methods. However, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle
technology raises a myriad of complex questions and challenges, from the technical and infrastructural
requirements of supporting autonomous vehicles, to the social and economic implications of their
widespread adoption.
One of the most significant advantages of autonomous vehicles is their potential to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and mitigate the environmental impacts of urban transportation. By optimizing routes
and reducing fuel consumption, autonomous vehicles could significantly decrease the carbon footprint
of urban transportation systems, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly
urban environment. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles could also improve road safety, as they are
capable of detecting and responding to potential hazards more quickly and accurately than human
drivers, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.
Despite these potential benefits, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technol-
ogy is not without its challenges. For instance, the requirement for advanced infrastructure, including
high-resolution mapping and real-time data transmission systems, poses significant technical and
financial hurdles. Additionally, the need for standardized regulations and laws governing the use
of autonomous vehicles raises complex questions about liability, insurance, and public acceptance.
Moreover, the potential for job displacement, as autonomous vehicles replace human drivers, raises
important social and economic concerns that must be carefully considered and addressed.
In a bizarre twist, some researchers have suggested that the most effective way to implement
autonomous vehicle technology may be to abandon traditional notions of transportation infrastructure
altogether, and instead focus on creating ""virtual transportation networks"" that exist solely in the
digital realm. According to this unconventional approach, autonomous vehicles would be capable
of navigating and interacting with virtual environments, rather than physical ones, allowing for the
creation of entirely new forms of transportation that are not bound by traditional notions of space
and distance. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it highlights the need for creative and innovative
thinking in the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology.
Moreover, the integration of autonomous vehicles into urban transportation systems also raises
important questions about the role of human agency and decision-making in the transportation
process. As autonomous vehicles become increasingly capable of navigating and interacting with
their environments, the need for human intervention and oversight may decrease, potentially leading
to a loss of control and autonomy for individual citizens. This raises important concerns about the
impact of autonomous vehicle technology on urban planning and design, as well as the potential for
autonomous vehicles to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.
In addition to these challenges, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technol-
ogy also raises important concerns about the potential for unexpected consequences and unforeseen
events. For instance, the possibility of autonomous vehicles being hacked or compromised by mali-
cious actors raises significant concerns about public safety and security. Furthermore, the potential
for autonomous vehicles to interact with and adapt to their environments in unpredictable ways raises
important questions about the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of autonomous vehicle
systems.
The potential for autonomous vehicles to transform urban transportation systems is vast and multi-
faceted, with implications that extend far beyond the technical and infrastructural requirements of
supporting autonomous vehicles. As researchers and policymakers, it is essential that we consider the
full range of potential benefits and challenges associated with autonomous vehicle technology, from
the environmental and social impacts of their widespread adoption, to the potential for unexpected
consequences and unforeseen events. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach
to the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the
benefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated
with their adoption.
Furthermore, the study of autonomous vehicle technology also intersects with other fields, such as
artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, which are essential for the development
of sophisticated autonomous vehicle systems. The use of machine learning algorithms, for example,
enables autonomous vehicles to learn from experience and adapt to new situations, while data
analytics provides valuable insights into transportation patterns and trends. The integration of these
2
technologies has the potential to create highly efficient and optimized transportation systems, which
could revolutionize the way people move around cities.
The relationship between autonomous vehicle technology and urban planning is also complex and
multifaceted. As autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent, urban planners will need to
rethink traditional notions of transportation infrastructure, including roads, highways, and public
transportation systems. The creation of dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles, for example,
could improve safety and efficiency, while also reducing congestion and pollution. Additionally, the
integration of autonomous vehicles into public transportation systems could provide new opportunities
for mobility and accessibility, particularly for elderly and disabled individuals.
In conclusion, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology has the
potential to transform urban transportation systems, offering a cleaner, safer, and more efficient
alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based transportation methods. However, the challenges and
complexities associated with autonomous vehicle technology are significant, and will require careful
consideration and planning to overcome. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach
to the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the
benefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated
with their adoption. The future of urban transportation is likely to be shaped by the intersection
of technological, social, and economic factors, and it is essential that we consider the full range of
potential implications and consequences of autonomous vehicle technology.

Related Work
Sustainable urban transportation has been a topic of interest for many years, with various approaches
being explored to reduce the environmental impact of transportation systems. One approach that has
gained significant attention in recent years is the use of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles
have the potential to revolutionize the way people move around cities, reducing the need for personal
vehicle ownership and promoting a more shared and sustainable transportation system. However,
the integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation systems is a complex task that
requires careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, regulations, and public
acceptance.
The concept of autonomous vehicles is not new, and researchers have been exploring the idea of
self-driving cars for decades. One of the earliest examples of an autonomous vehicle was the Stanford
Cart, a remote-controlled vehicle that was developed in the 1960s. Since then, there have been
numerous advancements in the field, with the development of more sophisticated sensors, algorithms,
and computing power. Today, autonomous vehicles are being tested on public roads, and several
companies are already offering autonomous taxi services in select cities.
Despite the progress that has been made, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed
before autonomous vehicles can become a reality. One of the main challenges is the development of
robust and reliable sensor systems that can detect and respond to various scenarios on the road. This
includes the detection of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, as well as the ability to navigate
through complex intersections and construction zones. Another challenge is the development of
algorithms that can make decisions in real-time, taking into account factors such as traffic laws, road
conditions, and weather.
In addition to the technical challenges, there are also social and economic factors that need to be
considered. For example, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to significant
job losses in the transportation sector, as human drivers become obsolete. On the other hand,
autonomous vehicles could also create new job opportunities in fields such as software development,
engineering, and maintenance. Furthermore, the use of autonomous vehicles could also have a
significant impact on urban planning, as cities may need to be redesigned to accommodate the new
technology.
One unexpected approach to sustainable urban transportation is the concept of ""vehicular algae
farms,"" where autonomous vehicles are equipped with algae-filled tanks that can be used to produce
biofuels. This approach is based on the idea that algae can be used to absorb carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, producing oxygen and organic compounds that can be converted into biofuels. While
3
this approach may seem bizarre, it has been proposed as a potential solution to reduce the carbon
footprint of transportation systems.
Another unusual approach is the use of ""swarm intelligence"" to optimize traffic flow. This involves
using autonomous vehicles to create a network of interconnected vehicles that can communicate with
each other and adjust their behavior to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. The idea is
that by mimicking the behavior of swarms of insects, such as bees or ants, autonomous vehicles can
create a more efficient and sustainable transportation system.
The use of autonomous vehicles in public transportation systems is also being explored. For example,
autonomous buses are being tested in several cities, with the goal of reducing labor costs and
improving the efficiency of public transportation. However, there are also concerns about the safety
and reliability of autonomous buses, particularly in areas with high levels of pedestrian activity.
In addition to the technical and social challenges, there are also regulatory hurdles that need to
be addressed. For example, there is currently a lack of standardization in the development and
deployment of autonomous vehicles, which can make it difficult to ensure safety and consistency
across different manufacturers and jurisdictions. Furthermore, there are also concerns about liability
and accountability in the event of an accident involving an autonomous vehicle.
The use of autonomous vehicles in freight transportation is also being explored. For example,
autonomous trucks are being tested on highways, with the goal of reducing labor costs and improving
the efficiency of freight transportation. However, there are also concerns about the safety and
reliability of autonomous trucks, particularly in areas with high levels of traffic congestion.
The integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation systems will require significant
investments in infrastructure, including the development of dedicated lanes and communication sys-
tems. For example, the use of dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology can enable
autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and with infrastructure, such as traffic lights
and road signs. However, the deployment of DSRC technology will require significant investments in
infrastructure, including the installation of DSRC transceivers along roads and highways.
The use of autonomous vehicles in rural areas is also being explored. For example, autonomous
vehicles are being tested in rural areas, with the goal of improving access to transportation and
reducing the isolation of rural communities. However, there are also concerns about the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles in rural areas, particularly in areas with limited infrastructure and
high levels of wildlife activity.
The development of autonomous vehicles is a complex task that requires careful consideration of
various factors, including technical, social, and economic factors. While there are many challenges
that need to be addressed, the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are significant, including
improved safety, reduced congestion, and increased accessibility. As researchers and policymakers
continue to explore the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential
to consider the many factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology.
The concept of ""mobility-as-a-service"" is also being explored, where autonomous vehicles are used
to provide on-demand transportation services to users. This approach has the potential to reduce the
need for personal vehicle ownership and promote a more shared and sustainable transportation system.
However, there are also concerns about the impact of mobility-as-a-service on public transportation
systems, particularly in areas with high levels of congestion.
The use of autonomous vehicles in emergency response situations is also being explored. For example,
autonomous vehicles are being tested as a potential solution for emergency medical response, where
they can be used to transport patients to hospitals quickly and safely. However, there are also concerns
about the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles in emergency response situations, particularly
in areas with high levels of traffic congestion.
The development of autonomous vehicles is a rapidly evolving field, with new technologies and
innovations being developed every day. As researchers and policymakers continue to explore the
use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential to consider the many
factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology. This includes technical,
social, and economic factors, as well as regulatory and infrastructure considerations. By taking a
comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to the development of autonomous vehicles, we can
create a more sustainable and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone.

Furthermore, the application of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can be seen
as a key component of the broader concept of ""smart cities,"" where technology is used to create more
efficient, sustainable, and livable urban environments. The use of autonomous vehicles in smart cities
can help to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban
residents. However, the development of smart cities also requires careful consideration of various
factors, including infrastructure, governance, and public engagement.
The use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can also be seen as a key
component of the broader concept of ""shared mobility,"" where transportation services are shared
among multiple users. The use of autonomous vehicles in shared mobility systems can help to reduce
the need for personal vehicle ownership, promote a more sustainable transportation system, and
enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of shared mobility
systems also requires careful consideration of various factors, including business models, governance,
and public engagement.
In addition, the application of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can also be
seen as a key component of the broader concept of ""urban logistics,"" where the movement of goods
and people is optimized to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality
of life for urban residents. The use of autonomous vehicles in urban logistics can help to reduce
the need for human drivers, promote a more efficient transportation system, and enhance the overall
quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of urban logistics systems also requires
careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, governance, and public engagement.

component of the broader concept of ""transportation systems management,"" where the movement of
goods and people is optimized to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall
quality of life for urban residents. The application of autonomous vehicles in transportation systems
management can help to reduce the need for human drivers, promote a more efficient transportation
system, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of
transportation systems management also requires careful consideration of various factors, including
infrastructure, governance, and public engagement.

Methodology
To develop a comprehensive framework for sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehi-
cles, we employed a multi-faceted approach that integrated theoretical modeling, simulation-based
analysis, and empirical data collection. The methodology was divided into distinct phases, each de-
signed to investigate a specific aspect of the problem. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive review of
existing literature on urban transportation systems, autonomous vehicle technology, and sustainability
metrics. This review helped identify key factors influencing the efficiency and environmental impact
5
of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems, including vehicle routing, traffic signal control,
passenger demand, and energy consumption.
A critical component of our methodology involved the development of a novel mathematical model
that captured the complex interactions between autonomous vehicles, urban infrastructure, and
passenger behavior. The model was formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, where the
objective function sought to minimize the overall carbon footprint of the transportation system while
satisfying passenger demand and safety constraints. To solve this problem, we utilized a combination
of metaheuristic algorithms and machine learning techniques, which enabled us to explore a vast
solution space and identify optimal configurations for autonomous vehicle deployment and routing.
In addition to the mathematical modeling, we also conducted a series of simulation experiments to
evaluate the performance of our proposed framework under various scenarios. These simulations
were performed using a custom-built platform that integrated autonomous vehicle simulators, traffic
microsimulators, and environmental impact assessment tools. The simulations allowed us to analyze
the effects of different factors, such as autonomous vehicle penetration rates, traffic signal control
strategies, and passenger demand patterns, on the overall sustainability of the transportation system.
Furthermore, we incorporated a range of unconventional factors into our simulations, including the
impact of urban wildlife on autonomous vehicle navigation and the potential for autonomous vehicles
to be used as mobile urban gardens.
One of the most intriguing aspects of our methodology involved the application of chaos theory and
complexity science principles to the analysis of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems. By
treating the system as a complex, nonlinear network, we were able to identify emergent patterns and
behaviors that would have been impossible to predict using traditional modeling approaches. This led
to some unexpected insights, such as the discovery that the optimal routing strategy for autonomous
vehicles is often equivalent to the shortest path in a fractal network. Moreover, our analysis revealed
that the carbon footprint of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems can be minimized by
intentionally introducing small amounts of randomness into the routing algorithms, a phenomenon
that we termed ""sustainable chaos.""
The empirical data collection phase of our methodology involved collaborating with several urban
transportation agencies and autonomous vehicle manufacturers to gather real-world data on passenger
demand, traffic patterns, and vehicle performance. This data was used to validate our mathematical
models and simulation results, as well as to identify areas for further improvement. We also
conducted a series of surveys and focus groups with passengers and transportation stakeholders to
gather feedback on the potential benefits and drawbacks of autonomous vehicle-based transportation
systems. The results of these surveys revealed a surprising level of enthusiasm for the idea of
using autonomous vehicles as mobile entertainment platforms, with many respondents expressing a
willingness to pay a premium for the ability to watch movies or play video games during their daily
commute.
To further enhance the sustainability of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems, we explored
the potential for integrating these systems with other modes of transportation, such as public transit
and ride-sharing services. This involved developing a range of novel algorithms and protocols
for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles with other vehicles and transportation
infrastructure. We also investigated the possibility of using autonomous vehicles as mobile energy
storage devices, which could potentially help to stabilize the electrical grid and reduce the carbon
footprint of urban energy systems. The results of our analysis suggested that this approach could be
particularly effective in urban areas with high concentrations of renewable energy sources, such as
solar or wind power.
In conclusion, our methodology for sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehicles was
characterized by a highly interdisciplinary and innovative approach, which integrated insights from
transportation engineering, computer science, environmental science, and complexity theory. By
combining theoretical modeling, simulation-based analysis, and empirical data collection, we were
able to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the sustainability of autonomous vehicle-
based transportation systems and identifying opportunities for improvement. The unexpected and
sometimes bizarre results of our analysis, such as the potential for autonomous vehicles to be used as
mobile urban gardens or the benefits of introducing randomness into routing algorithms, highlight the
need for continued innovation and experimentation in this field. Ultimately, our methodology provides
a foundation for the development of more sustainable, efficient, and resilient urban transportation
6
systems, which can help to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization and improve the
quality of life for urban residents.

Experiments
To investigate the efficacy of nanosensor-based soil analysis for urban agriculture, a series of exper-
iments were designed to evaluate the performance of these nanosensors in various soil types and
conditions. The experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, where the soil samples
were carefully prepared and treated to mimic real-world urban agricultural scenarios. A total of 100
soil samples were collected from different urban agricultural sites, including rooftops, community
gardens, and backyard farms. These samples were then categorized into five distinct groups based on
their texture, organic matter content, and pH levels.
Each soil sample was further subdivided into three smaller portions, which were then subjected to
different treatments, including the addition of various nutrients, contaminants, and microorganisms.
The nanosensors, which were designed to detect a range of soil parameters, including pH, nutrient
levels, and moisture content, were then inserted into each soil portion. The nanosensors were equipped
with advanced sensing technologies, including nanowires, nanotubes, and graphene-based sensors,
which enabled them to detect even minor changes in the soil conditions.
In addition to the nanosensors, a range of traditional soil analysis techniques were also employed,
including spectroscopy, chromatography, and microscopy. These techniques were used to validate
the accuracy and reliability of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. The experiments were
conducted over a period of six months, during which time the soil samples were regularly monitored
and analyzed using both the nanosensors and traditional techniques.
One of the most unusual approaches used in the experiments was the incorporation of musical
vibrations to enhance the sensitivity of the nanosensors. It was hypothesized that the vibrations from
certain types of music could resonate with the nanosensors, allowing them to detect even subtle
changes in the soil conditions. To test this hypothesis, the soil samples were exposed to a range of
musical genres, including classical, jazz, and rock music. The results of these experiments were
surprising, with some of the nanosensors showing a significant increase in sensitivity when exposed
to certain types of music.
The experimental design also included a range of control groups, which were used to evaluate the
potential impact of various environmental factors on the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. These
factors included temperature, humidity, and light intensity, all of which can potentially affect the
accuracy and reliability of the nanosensors. The control groups were designed to mimic real-world
urban agricultural scenarios, where the soil conditions can be highly variable and unpredictable.
To further evaluate the performance of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system, a range of statistical
models were developed and applied to the experimental data. These models included linear regression,
decision trees, and neural networks, all of which were used to identify patterns and relationships
in the data. The results of these analyses were used to refine and optimize the nanosensor-based
soil analysis system, with the goal of developing a highly accurate and reliable system for urban
agricultural applications.
The experiments also involved the use of advanced data visualization techniques, including 3D
printing and virtual reality. These techniques were used to create highly detailed and interactive
models of the soil samples, which could be used to visualize and analyze the data in a more
intuitive and immersive way. The use of these techniques allowed the researchers to gain a deeper
understanding of the complex relationships between the soil parameters and the nanosensor-based
soil analysis system.
In terms of the specific experimental procedures, the soil samples were first prepared and treated as
described above. The nanosensors were then inserted into each soil portion, and the soil samples
were placed in a controlled environment chamber. The chamber was equipped with a range of sensors
and monitoring equipment, which were used to track the soil conditions and the performance of
the nanosensors. The musical vibrations were applied to the soil samples using a specialized sound
system, which was designed to resonate with the nanosensors. The experiments were conducted in a
randomized and replicated design, with multiple replicates of each treatment and control group.
7
The results of the experiments were collected and analyzed using a range of software tools and
statistical packages. The data were first cleaned and filtered to remove any errors or inconsistencies,
and then subjected to a range of statistical analyses, including hypothesis testing and regression
analysis. The results of these analyses were used to draw conclusions about the performance and
efficacy of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system, and to identify areas for further research and
development.
To present the results of the experiments in a clear and concise manner, a range of tables and figures
were created. For example, the following table shows the results of the experiments, including the
mean and standard deviation of the soil parameters and the performance of the nanosensors: This

soil analysis system was highly accurate and reliable, with a mean accuracy of 90±5% across all soil
types. The results also show that the musical vibrations had a significant impact on the performance
of the nanosensors, with certain types of music (e.g. classical) resulting in higher accuracy and
reliability.

Results
The deployment of nanosensor-based soil analysis systems in urban agricultural settings has yielded a
plethora of intriguing results, warranting a comprehensive examination of the data collected. Initially,
the nanosensors were calibrated to detect minute variations in soil composition, including pH levels,
nutrient content, and moisture saturation. The calibration process involved immersing the nanosensors
in a controlled soil environment with predetermined characteristics, allowing for the establishment of
a baseline for subsequent measurements.
Upon deployment in urban agricultural plots, the nanosensors began transmitting data in real-time,
facilitating the monitoring of soil conditions with unprecedented precision. The data revealed a
fascinating phenomenon, wherein the soil’s microbial ecosystem exhibited a symbiotic relationship
with the nanosensors, effectively ""hacking"" into the sensors’ communication protocols to transmit their
own signals. This unexpected development prompted an investigation into the potential applications
of this phenomenon, including the possibility of leveraging the microbial ecosystem as a conduit for
soil-nanosensor interfaces.
Further analysis of the data revealed a statistically significant correlation between the nanosensors’
readings and the yields of various crops, suggesting that the nanosensors could be used to predict
optimal harvesting times and fertilizer application schedules. However, an unconventional approach
was also explored, wherein the nanosensors were used to generate a form of ""soil music"" by converting
the sensor readings into audible sound waves. This innovative method, dubbed ""soil sonification,"" was
found to have a profound impact on the crops, with certain sound frequencies apparently stimulating
accelerated growth and increased yields.
To further explore the efficacy of soil sonification, a series of experiments were conducted, involving
the exposure of crops to various sound wave frequencies and amplitudes. The results were nothing
short of astonishing, with certain sound patterns eliciting remarkable responses from the crops,
including the formation of intricate, fractal-like patterns on the surface of leaves and the emission of
faint, luminescent glows from the soil itself. While the scientific community may view these findings
with a healthy dose of skepticism, the potential implications for urban agriculture are undeniable, and
warrant further investigation.

In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving these phenomena, a team of
researchers was assembled to conduct a thorough analysis of the nanosensor data and soil sonification
experiments. The team’s findings were presented in a series of tables, including the following:

These tables illustrate the complex relationships between nanosensor readings, crop yields, and soil
sonification parameters, highlighting the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms
driving these phenomena. As the field of nanosensor-based soil analysis continues to evolve, it is
likely that new, innovative approaches will emerge, challenging our current understanding of the
intricate relationships between soil, crops, and the environment.
The integration of nanosensors, soil sonification, and urban agriculture has the potential to revolution-
ize the way we approach crop cultivation, enabling the creation of highly optimized, precision farming
systems that minimize waste and maximize yields. However, the development of such systems will
require a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating expertise from fields such as materials science,
agronomy, and environmental engineering. Furthermore, the potential applications of soil sonifica-
tion extend far beyond the realm of agriculture, with possible uses in fields such as environmental
monitoring, conservation, and even medicine.
In conclusion, the results of the nanosensor-based soil analysis and soil sonification experiments have
far-reaching implications for the field of urban agriculture, highlighting the potential for innovative,
technology-driven approaches to improve crop yields, reduce waste, and promote sustainable farming
practices. As research in this area continues to advance, it is likely that new, groundbreaking
discoveries will be made, challenging our current understanding of the complex relationships between
soil, crops, and the environment, and paving the way for a more sustainable, food-secure future. The
sheer scope and complexity of this research endeavor demand a concerted effort from the scientific
community, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to ensure that the benefits of nanosensor-based
soil analysis and soil sonification are realized, and that the potential risks and challenges associated
with these technologies are mitigated.
Ultimately, the success of nanosensor-based soil analysis and soil sonification will depend on the
ability of researchers, farmers, and policymakers to work together, sharing knowledge, expertise, and
resources to create a more sustainable, equitable, and food-secure world. The journey ahead will be
long and challenging, but the potential rewards are well worth the effort, and the possibilities for
innovation and discovery are endless. As we embark on this exciting journey, we must remain open
to new ideas, perspectives, and approaches, embracing the complexity and uncertainty of the research
endeavor, and striving to create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the development and implementation of nanosensor-based soil analysis for urban
agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach sustainable farming practices in
metropolitan areas. By leveraging the unique properties of nanomaterials, these sensors can detect
even the slightest changes in soil composition, allowing for real-time monitoring and adjustment of
crop conditions. However, it is also crucial to consider the potential risks and challenges associated
9
with the widespread adoption of this technology, including the possibility of nanosensor malfunction,
soil contamination, and the impact on local ecosystems. Furthermore, the integration of nanosensor-
based soil analysis with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of
Things, could lead to the creation of highly sophisticated and autonomous urban farming systems.
Moreover, the use of nanosensors in soil analysis could also enable the development of novel farming
practices, such as precision agriculture, which involves the precise application of water, nutrients, and
pesticides to specific areas of the soil. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce waste,
increase crop yields, and minimize the environmental impact of farming. In addition, the real-time
data provided by nanosensors could be used to develop advanced predictive models of soil behavior,
allowing farmers to anticipate and prepare for potential problems, such as soil erosion, nutrient
depletion, and pest infestations. It is also worth noting that the application of nanosensor-based
soil analysis is not limited to traditional farming practices, but could also be used in non-traditional
settings, such as urban gardens, green roofs, and vertical farms. In these environments, the use of
nanosensors could help to optimize soil conditions, reduce maintenance costs, and increase crop
yields, making urban agriculture a more viable and sustainable option for urban populations. On
the other hand, a more unorthodox approach to nanosensor-based soil analysis could involve the
use of nanosensors to detect and analyze the unique energy signatures emitted by plants, which
could be used to develop a new form of plant-based communication. This approach, while highly
speculative, could potentially revolutionize our understanding of plant behavior and intelligence,
and could have significant implications for the development of more sustainable and harmonious
farming practices. Additionally, the development of nanosensor-based soil analysis could also be
influenced by the principles of chaos theory, which suggests that complex systems, such as soil
ecosystems, are inherently unpredictable and prone to sudden, dramatic changes. By embracing
this unpredictability, and using nanosensors to monitor and analyze the complex interactions within
soil ecosystems, farmers and researchers could develop a more nuanced and dynamic understanding
of soil behavior, and could potentially uncover new and innovative approaches to soil management

P135.pdf,"A Decentralized Local Stochastic Extragradient
Approach for Variational Inequalities
Abstract
This study examines distributed stochastic variational inequalities (VIs) within
unbounded domains, where the problem data is heterogeneous, meaning it is non-
identically distributed and spread across numerous devices. We adopt a broad
assumption regarding the computational network, which encompasses fully de-
centralized computations with dynamic networks and the centralized structures
commonly employed in Federated Learning. Additionally, we allow multiple local
updates on the workers to reduce how often they communicate. We adapt the
stochastic extragradient method to this versatile framework, and conduct theoreti-
cal analysis on its convergence rate, specifically in strongly-monotone, monotone,
and non-monotone scenarios (given that a Minty solution is available). The rates
we provide demonstrate a clear relationship with various network properties like
mixing time, the number of iterations, data heterogeneity, variance, the quantity
of devices, and other typical parameters. As a particular application, our method
and analysis can be used for distributed stochastic saddle-point problems (SPP),
such as the training of Deep Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is
known to be very difficult when using decentralized training. The experiments we
perform for decentralized GANs training demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
approach.
1
Introduction
In extensive machine learning (ML) situations, training data is often split among multiple devices
like data centers or mobile devices. Decentralized training methods can produce an ML model
with the same accuracy as if all data were on a single server. Moreover, decentralized training has
advantages over traditional centralized methods including data ownership, privacy, fault tolerance, and
scalability. Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning approach where the training process
is managed by a single device or server that communicates with all the participating clients. However,
in fully decentralized learning (FD) scenarios, devices only communicate with their neighbors via a
communication network with an arbitrary structure. Therefore, decentralized algorithms are valuable
when centralized communication is expensive, undesirable, or impossible.
Recently, significant advances have been made in the creation, design, and understanding of decen-
tralized training methods. In particular, aspects such as data heterogeneity, communication efficiency,
which includes local updates or compression, and personalization have been explored. However,
these advancements have focused on training with single-criterion loss functions, which lead to
minimization problems, and are not applicable to more general types of problems. For instance,
training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) requires the simultaneous competing optimization
of the generator and discriminator objectives, which translates to solving a non-convex-non-concave
saddle-point problem (SPP). This kind of problem structure makes GANs extremely challenging to
train, even in the single-node setting, let alone when training over decentralized datasets.
This study centers around solving decentralized stochastic SPPs and, more broadly, decentralized
stochastic Minty variational inequalities (MVIs). In a decentralized stochastic MVI, data is distributed
.
across M or more devices/nodes. Each device m has access to its own local stochastic oracle Fm(z, m)
for the local operator Fm(z) := EmDmFm(z, m). The data m in device m follows a distribution Dm,
which can vary across devices. The devices are connected via a communication network, allowing
two devices to exchange information only if their corresponding nodes are connected by an edge in
the network graph. The objective is to find cooperatively a point z* Rn that satisfies the inequality:
M
X
m=1
E[Fm(z∗), z −z∗] ≥0
(1)
for all z Rn.
A specific instance of decentralized stochastic MVIs is the decentralized stochastic SPP with local
objectives fm(x, y) := EmDm[fm(x, y, m)]:
min
x∈Rn max
y∈Rm
M
X
m=1
fm(x, y)
(2)
The connection to VI can be seen by setting z = (x, y) and the gradient field F(z) = (xf(x, y), -yf(x,
y)). In cases where f(x,y) is convex-concave, the operator F(z) is monotone. However, in the context
of GANs training, where x and y are parameters of the generator and discriminator, respectively, the
local losses fm(x, y) are generally non-convex-non-concave in x, y, and monotonicity of F cannot be
assumed.
In this study, we develop a new algorithm for addressing problems (1) and (2). Because gradient
descent-ascent for problem (2) can diverge even in simple convex-concave settings with a single
device, we use extragradient updates and combine them with a gossip-type communication protocol
on arbitrary, possibly dynamic, network topologies. One challenge arising from communication
constraints is a “network error” that stems from the inability of all devices to achieve exact consensus.
Therefore, each device uses a local variable, with only approximate consensus among devices
achieved through gossip steps. Our method avoids multiple gossip steps per iteration, leading to
better practical performance on dynamic networks. It also allows multiple local updates between
communication rounds to reduce communication overhead, making it suitable for communication-
and privacy-restricted FL or fully decentralized scenarios.
Our Contributions:
1. We have created an algorithm that uses extragradient updates to tackle distributed stochas-
tic MVIs, and consequently distributed stochastic SPPs, with heterogeneous data. This
framework offers a flexible communication protocol that supports centralized settings like
Federated Learning, fully decentralized configurations, local steps in both centralized and
decentralized setups, and dynamic network topologies.
2. Using this general communication protocol, we have demonstrated the convergence of our
algorithm in three MVI settings, namely where the operator is strongly-monotone, monotone,
or non-monotone (assuming a Minty condition is met). The rates of convergence depend
explicitly on several problem parameters, such as network characteristics, data heterogeneity,
data variance, number of devices, and other relevant factors. These theoretical results
translate directly to the corresponding SPP settings (strongly-convex-strongly-concave,
convex-concave, and non-convex-non-concave under the Minty condition). All theoretical
results are valid when using heterogeneous data, and allow quantifying how factors like data
heterogeneity, noise in the data, and network characteristics influence convergence rate. We
have also shown that for decentralized settings, our results are novel for time-varying graphs
and the three different monotonicity settings.
3. We have verified our theoretical results through numerical experiments and demonstrated the
effectiveness of our strategy in practice. Specifically, we have trained a DCGAN architecture
on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Related Work
Research on MVIs dates back to at least 1962, and has been continued in recent works. VIs are
used in diverse applications: image denoising, game theory and optimal control, robust optimization,
and non-smooth optimization using smooth reformulations. In ML, MVIs and SPPs arise in GANs
training, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training.
The extragradient method (EGM) was first introduced and later expanded to include deterministic
problems and stochastic problems with bounded variance. However, if the stochastic noise is not
uniformly bounded, EGM can diverge.

Algorithm
This section details our proposed algorithm (Algorithm 1) based on two main concepts: (i) the extra-
gradient step (as seen in classical methods for VIs), and (ii) gossip averaging (used in decentralized
optimization and diffusion strategies in distributed learning). Instead of using gradient descent, as
in similar algorithms, ours uses the extragradient method. It is designed for VIs and SPPs. It also
includes local steps between communication rounds, supports dynamic networks, and comes with
non-asymptotic theoretical convergence guarantees.
Each step of Algorithm 1 has two phases. The local phase (lines 4–6) involves a step of the stochastic
extragradient method at each node using only local data. Nodes make an extrapolation step “to
look into the future” and then update using the operator value at the “future” point. Next is the
communication phase (line 7), during which nodes share local iterates with their neighbors Nm in the
communication network graph for each iteration k. Averaging is done using weights w k m,i, which
are matrix Wk elements called the mixing matrix.
Definition 2.1 (Mixing matrix). A matrix W [0; 1]M×M is a mixing matrix if it satisfies: 1) W is
symmetric, 2) W is doubly stochastic (W1 = 1, 1TW = 1T, where 1 is the vector of all ones), 3) W is
aligned with the network: wij 0 if and only if i = j or the edge (i, j) is in the communication network
graph.
Reasonable choices of mixing matrices include Wk = IM Lk /max(Lk), where Lk is the Laplacian
matrix of the network graph at step k and IM is the identity matrix, or by using local rules based on
the degrees of the neighboring nodes. Our setting offers great flexibility because the communication
graph’s topology can change between iterations. The matrix Wk, which encodes the current network,
also changes. This is encoded in line 2, where Wk is generated using a rule Wk that can vary.
Examples include the deterministic choice of a matrix sequence Wk or sampling from a dynamic
probability distribution on matrices. Local steps without communication can be encoded with a
diagonal matrix Wk.

To ensure consensus between nodes, the mixing properties of the matrix sequence Wk must satisfy
the following assumption:
Assumption 2.2 (Expected Consensus Rate). There exists a constant p (0, 1] and an integer 1 such
that, after K iterations, for all matrices Z Rd×M and all integers l 0, . . . , K/ ,

where Wl = W(l+1)1 ...Wl, we use the matrix notation Z = [z1, ..., zM] with z = (1/M)m=1M zm, and
the expectation EW is over distributions of W and indices t l,...,(l+1) - 1.
This assumption guarantees that the consensus between nodes improves by a factor of 1-p after every
gossip steps. Some matrices Wk can be the identity matrix (local steps only).

Setting and Assumptions
This section outlines the assumptions used to analyze the proposed algorithm:
Assumption 3.1 (Lipschitzness). For every m, the operator Fm(z) is Lipschitz with a constant L,
meaning that:
||Fm(z1) −Fm(z2)|| ≤L||z1 −z2||, ∀z1, z2
(4)
This is a common assumption used when analyzing all the methods in Table 1.
Assumption 3.2. We consider three scenarios for the operator F: (SM) Strong monotonicity, (M)
Monotonicity, and (NM) Non-monotonicity under the Minty condition:
(SM) Strong monotonicity. For some > 0 and for all z1, z2, we have:
(F(z1) −F(z2), z1 −z2) ≥µ||z1 −z2||2
(5)
(M) Monotonicity. For all z1, z2, we have:
(F(z1) −F(z2), z1 −z2) ≥0
(6)
(NM) Non-monotonicity (Minty). There exists z such that, for all z,
(F(z), z −z∗) ≥0
(7)
Assumptions (SM), (M), and (L) are widely used in the literature. Assumption (NM), often called
Minty or Variational Stability, has recently been used as a non-monotonicity variant, particularly in
GANs training.
Assumption 3.3 (Bounded noise). Fm(z, ) is unbiased and has bounded variance. This means, for all
z:
E[Fm(z, ξ)] = Fm(z),
E[||Fm(z, ξ) −Fm(z)||2] ≤σ2
(8)
The final assumption pertains to the variability of local operators compared to their mean, which is
called D-heterogeneity, and is commonly used when analyzing local-step algorithms.
Assumption 3.4 (D-heterogeneity). The values of the local operator have bounded variability:
||Fm(z) −¯F(z)|| ≤D

This section presents convergence rates for our proposed method under different settings de-
fined by Assumption 3.2. We introduce the notation z = (1/M)m=1M zk for the average iter-
ates and Z = (1/K)k=0K-1 z for the averaged sequence, i.e., ergodic average. We denote

by Algorithm 1 runs for K > 0 iterations. Then:

The proof of the theorem can be found in the supplementary materials, where the dependence of
rates on the stepsize before optimal selection are given. In contrast to other analyses, our analysis
addresses the fact that problem (1) has no feasible bounded set, which is important for analysis in
both monotone and non-monotone settings. Furthermore, our algorithm includes a communication
step that introduces a bias in the oracle, which needs to be analyzed over unbounded feasible sets.
We overcome this by bounding the bias, and proving the boundedness in expectation of the sequence
of iterates for both monotone and non-monotone cases. We also analyze stochastic extragradient
method with biased oracles on unbounded domains which has not been done before. We achieve this
under a general Assumption 2.2, with time varying graphs and all three monotonicity settings.
The convergence rates explicitly depend on the network, characterized by mixing time and mixing
factor p, and on data heterogeneity D, which appear only as the quantity , the variance 2, Lipschitz
constant L, strong monotonicity parameter , and the number of nodes M. These results help us
determine how data heterogeneity, noise, and network characteristics influence convergence. This
opens meta-optimization opportunities to design networks and set parameters such as M, , and p to
improve convergence.
The convergence results presented in the theorem have a similar multi-term structure. The first term
is from the deterministic case and mirrors existing methods for smooth VIs in a non-distributed
setting. The second term is stochastic and is also standard for the non-distributed setting. The leading
stochastic term is proportional to 2/M, decreasing with the number of nodes. Other terms represent
a consensus error, due to imperfect communication between nodes. In all the cases this does not
worsen the convergence, because dependence on K is no worse than the stochastic term.
Theorem 4.1 is given for a fixed iteration budget K, and corresponding stepsizes that depend on K,
which is standard in literature. We also offer a procedure that allows extending the result to all-time
convergence without a priori fixed K, by restarting the algorithm after K iterations, which are doubled
each time.
In the strongly monotone case, our rate is slightly better than other results. The other methods’
stepsize is limited as
p/(L2), slowing convergence. For decentralized settings, our rate is worse,
probably because Assumption 2.2 is more general, but our algorithm is more practical because it
avoids multiple gossip steps per iteration and works with time-varying topologies. In the monotone
case, we use the Gap function as a measure of suboptimality. And in the non-monotone setting we are
able to obtain convergence up to a certain accuracy. It is important to note that we use assumptions
about iterates that we can obtain only when they are generated by the algorithm. We manage to obtain
corresponding results that can be used for establishing that the algorithm behaves nicely under certain
initial conditions. The experimental section will demonstrate these theoretical findings.

Experiments
Here we present two experiments to validate the performance of Algorithm 1. Section 5.1 verifies the
obtained convergence guarantees on two examples, a strongly-monotone and a monotone bilinear
problem. Section 5.2 uses a non-monotone case with a GAN training application. Full details about
the experimental setup are available in the supplementary material.

6.1
Verifying Theoretical Convergence Rate
This experiment aims to determine whether Algorithm 1’s actual performance matches our theoretical
rate from Theorem 4.1.
We consider a distributed bilinear saddle point problem (SPP) with the objective functions:
fm(x, y) = a∥x∥2 + b⟨y, Cmx⟩,
where x, y, Cm ∈Rn, and a, b are real numbers.
This setup satisfies the assumptions with constants:
µ = a,
L = a2 + b2,
D = max
m ∥Cm∥.
The network uses M = 20 nodes with uniform averaging weights. The dimension is n = 5, b = 1,
D ≈3, and τ = 1. The p value is approximately 0.288.
To obtain stochastic gradients, unbiased Gaussian noise with variance σ2 is added.
Convergence Behaviour. The convergence of Algorithm 1 with a fixed stepsize in both the strongly-
monotone (a = 1) and monotone (a = 0) settings. In the strongly monotone setting we observe linear
convergence up to an error floor determined by the noise and problem parameters. The monotone
case converges more slowly, but is still linear up to a level. This is expected for bilinear problems. We
see that when a constant stepsize is used in stochastic optimization algorithms, convergence is usually
limited to a certain neighborhood, see Theorem 2 in a previous study. Theorem 4.1 also reflects this;
convergence with zero error requires a diminishing stepsize. In the supplementary material, we also
validate with decreasing stepsize.
We verify the dependence on the heterogeneity parameter D and set the noise σ2 = 0. Based on
the theory, we expect that the error when σ = 0 scales as O(D2K−2). We conduct experiments by
setting b = 1 and a = 1, and measuring how many iterations are needed for

while varying D. The step size is tuned for every experiment.
The number of iterations scale as K ≈ϵ−4, confirming that the error depends on K as O(K−1/2).
The middle plot shows that iterations scale proportionally to D (D ≈K). Lastly, we see the number
of iterations to reach ϵ = 0.01 while varying the graph parameter p, and observe D ≈p · K. This
means that experiments confirm the O

Training GANs
Our method allows for combining communication graph topologies and local steps during distributed
learning. This section explores our method on GANs training. In Section A.1, we discuss the
relevance of our theoretical results to GANs training.
Data and model. We use the CIFAR-10 dataset which includes 60,000 images across 10 classes. We
increase the dataset four times by adding transformations and noise, and simulate a distributed set
up using 16 nodes on two GPUs with Ray. We create heterogeneity by splitting the dataset into 16
subsets where a major class makes up 20% of the data and the rest is split uniformly between all the
other classes. We use the DCGAN architecture, conditioned by class labels, similar to a previous
paper. We use Adam as the optimizer. We make one local Adam step and one gossip averaging step
with time-varying matrices Wk, similarly to Algorithm 1.
Settings. We compare the following topologies, with respective matrices Wk:
• Full. A full graph is used at the end of each epoch; otherwise, local steps are taken. This
leads to 120 communication rounds per epoch.
• Local. A full graph is used every five epochs; otherwise, local steps are taken. This means
24 communication rounds per epoch on average.
6
• Clusters. At the end of each epoch, clique clusters of size 4 are formed randomly (4 cliques
in total). This results in 24 communication rounds per epoch.
The first topology has a 5x larger communication budget.
The learning rate is 0.002 for both generator and discriminator. The rest of the parameters are in the
supplementary material.
7
Results
The methods reach a similar convergence in terms of local epochs and produced similar images.
The Local and Cluster topologies perform much better in terms of communication, with the Cluster
topology slightly outperforming the Local.
8
Conclusion
We have developed an effective algorithm to solve decentralized stochastic MVIs and SPPs, assuming
a highly flexible network topology and communication constraints. This method represents the first
decentralized extragradient approach that supports local steps for dynamic network topologies. We
theoretically demonstrated the convergence rate of the algorithm for SM, M, and NM cases. In
numerical experiments, we validated that the dependency on the data heterogeneity parameter D is
tight in the SM case and impossible to improve in general. By training DCGAN in a decentralized
manner, we showed our method’s effectiveness for practical DL tasks. Future work could extend
these algorithms to infinite-dimensional problems.

Implications on Ancient Mesopotamian Architectural
Designs
Abstract
Virus transmission is intricately linked to the migratory patterns of Scandinavian
pastry chefs, who inadvertently facilitate the spread of infectious agents through
their creative use of flaky crusts and tart fillings, which in turn are influenced by
the nuanced harmonies of 19th-century German chamber music, particularly the
works of Franz Schubert, whose impromptus eerily foreshadow the unpredictable
behavior of viral mutations, meanwhile the cellular mechanisms underlying viral
replication bear a striking resemblance to the processes governing the formation of
intricate sand mandalas in Tibetan Buddhist rituals, and the resultant viral particles
exhibit a propensity for self-organization that defies the fundamental principles
of thermodynamics, much like the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which has
been known to induce a state of profound contemplation in those who gaze upon it,
thereby altering their perception of reality and rendering them more susceptible to
the insidious effects of viral infection.

Introduction
The convoluted pathways of viral evolution are mirrored in the labyrinthine structures of Gothic
cathedrals, whose soaring vaults and ribbed arches seem to embody the very essence of viral
adaptability, as the stones themselves appear to be infused with a vital energy that transcends the
mundane realm of mortal existence, entering a domain where the distinctions between reality and myth
blur, and the virus assumes a life of its own, guided by an inscrutable intelligence that orchestrates
the intricate dance of molecular interactions, yielding a symphony of unprecedented complexity,
whose harmonies and discordances resonate throughout the cosmos, echoing the haunting melodies
of a forgotten era, when the boundaries between the human and the viral were more fluid, and the
cosmos was alive with the vibrant rhythms of an unbridled creativity. The emergence of novel viral
strains is inextricably linked to the trajectory of comets, whose celestial paths are believed to exert
a profound influence on the terrestrial biosphere, seeding the planet with exotic genetic material
that awakens dormant potentialities within the viral genome, unleashing a cascade of innovative
adaptations that redefine the parameters of viral evolution, as the boundaries between the self and the
non-self become increasingly blurred, and the distinctions between host and parasite dissolve, giving
rise to a new paradigm of symbiotic relationships, where the virus assumes the role of a catalyst,
facilitating the emergence of novel forms of life that defy the conventional categories of taxonomy,
and embody the unbridled diversity of an ever-evolving cosmos. The study of viral dynamics is
thus intimately connected to the confluence of disparate disciplines, including astrobiology, culinary
anthropology, and the physics of non-equilibrium systems, which collectively contribute to a deeper
understanding of the intricate web of relationships that underlies the complex phenomenon of viral
infection, revealing a world of breathtaking beauty and profound mystery, where the virus assumes
the role of a cosmic messenger, bearing tidings of a universe that is at once familiar and strange,
inviting us to embark on a journey of discovery that will forever alter our perception of the intricate
relationships between the human, the viral, and the cosmos.
The concept of virus has been intricately linked to the ephemeral nature of cheese production,
whereby the molecular structure of-casein is juxtaposed with the theoretical frameworks of galactic
cosmology, thus precipitating a paradigmatic shift in our understanding of virological phenomena.
Furthermore, the ontological implications of virus research have been observed to intersect with the

Methodology
The preparation of our research commenced with an exhaustive examination of the dichotomous
nature of citrus fruits and their potential impact on the aerodynamics of paper airplanes, which
somehow led us to investigate the migratory patterns of butterflies in relation to the virus under
investigation. This, in turn, necessitated a thorough analysis of the historical significance of door
knobs and their influence on the development of modern calculus. Furthermore, we delved into
the realm of culinary arts, where we discovered that the art of preparing the perfect soufflé is, in
fact, intimately connected to the behavior of subatomic particles in high-energy collisions, which,
surprisingly, bear a striking resemblance to the mechanisms of viral replication.
In order to better comprehend the intricacies of viral dynamics, we conducted an in-depth study
of the socio-linguistic implications of slang terminology in modern internet slang, which, to our
astonishment, revealed a hidden pattern of linguistic evolution that parallels the adaptive mechanisms
employed by viruses to evade the immune system. This revelation prompted us to explore the realm
of theoretical physics, where we encountered the concept of ""flumplenooks"" – a previously unknown
phenomenon that describes the hypothetical particles thought to mediate the interactions between
viruses and their host cells. The properties of flumplenooks, as we have termed them, are still not
fully understood, but preliminary results suggest that they may play a crucial role in the transmission
and propagation of viruses.
Our research team also investigated the aerodynamic properties of various types of jellybeans, which,
counterintuitively, led us to develop a novel mathematical framework for modeling the spread of

we found that the viscosity of honey is directly proportional to the wavelength of light emitted by
fireflies, which, in turn, is related to the oscillation frequency of pendulums in grandfather clocks – a

rates.
The next phase of our research involved a comprehensive analysis of the world’s most popular recipes
for chicken soup, which, as it turns out, hold the key to understanding the molecular mechanisms
underlying viral entry into host cells. By applying advanced techniques from the field of cryogenic

allowing us to visualize the intricate dance of molecular interactions that facilitate this process. Our
observations revealed a previously unknown class of molecular entities, which we have dubbed
6
""snurflots"" – tiny, proteinaceous particles that seem to play a crucial role in the early stages of viral
infection.
In a surprising twist, our investigation of snurflots led us to explore the realm of medieval folklore,
where we discovered a rich tradition of myths and legends surrounding the properties of dragon’s
breath – a mythical substance thought to possess remarkable healing properties. Closer examination
of these myths revealed a hidden pattern of symbolic references to the molecular structure of viruses,
which, in turn, led us to develop a novel approach to antiviral therapy based on the principles of
homeopathic medicine. Although the results of this approach are still preliminary, they suggest that
the strategic application of essences derived from rare, exotic flowers may hold the key to unlocking
a new generation of antiviral treatments.
Further research led us to investigate the relationship between the orbit of the planet Neptune and the
prevalence of viral outbreaks on Earth, which, to our amazement, revealed a statistically significant

team is currently exploring the potential applications of this discovery in the development of novel,
Frisbee-based technologies for virus surveillance and tracking.
In another surprising turn of events, our investigation of Frisbee aerodynamics led us to explore the
realm of quantum entanglement, where we discovered a previously unknown phenomenon that we
have dubbed ""entanglonification"" – a process by which the quantum states of two or more particles
become linked in a way that transcends classical notions of space and time. Although the implications
of entanglonification are still not fully understood, preliminary results suggest that it may play a
crucial role in the emergence of complex behaviors in viral populations – a finding that, if confirmed,
could revolutionize our understanding of viral evolution and ecology.

team is currently exploring the potential applications of this discovery in the development of novel,
kite-based technologies for virus surveillance and tracking.
In a surprising twist, our investigation of kite aerodynamics led us to explore the realm of ancient
Egyptian mythology, where we discovered a rich tradition of myths and legends surrounding the
properties of scarab beetles – a symbol of rebirth and regeneration in ancient Egyptian culture.
Closer examination of these myths revealed a hidden pattern of symbolic references to the molecular
structure of viruses, which, in turn, led us to develop a novel approach to antiviral therapy based on
the principles of mythological symbolism. Although the results of this approach are still preliminary,
they suggest that the strategic application of essences derived from rare, exotic plants may hold the
key to unlocking a new generation of antiviral treatments.

Experiments
The experimental protocol involved a comprehensive analysis of the migratory patterns of flamingos,
which surprisingly led to a deeper understanding of the molecular structure of viruses, particularly in
relation to the consumption of durian fruit and its effects on the human brain’s ability to comprehend
quantum physics. Furthermore, the incorporation of sonification techniques, wherein the vibrational
frequencies of harp strings were used to modulate the growth rates of fungal colonies, yielded
intriguing insights into the interconnectedness of fungal mycelium and the spread of viral infections.
In a seemingly unrelated yet fascinating turn of events, our research team discovered that the
aerodynamic properties of parachute designs could be applied to the study of viral transmission
dynamics, especially in densely populated urban areas where the sounds of hip-hop music appear to
have a profound impact on the mutation rates of certain viral strains. This unexpected convergence
of disciplines prompted an in-depth examination of the cultural significance of disco dancing in the
1970s and its potential role in shaping modern epidemiological trends. The results, though preliminary,
suggest a complex interplay between the mirror ball’s reflective properties, the mesmerizing effects
of polyester clothing, and the emergence of novel viral variants.
A critical component of our experimental approach involved the creation of a controlled environment
simulating the atmospheric conditions found on Mars, which, counterintuitively, allowed us to
better comprehend the role of citrus fruits in enhancing the human immune system’s response to
viral infections. This Martian simulation also led to a profound understanding of the philosophical
8
underpinnings of existentialism and its relation to the global distribution of pandas, an animal that,
despite its apparent lack of connection to viruses, holds secrets to the development of novel antiviral
therapies. The pandas, in turn, directed our attention to the intricate patterns found on the shells of
turtles, which encode, in a language yet to be fully deciphered, the principles of viral replication and
the art of playing the harmonica.
To further elucidate the complexities of viral dynamics, we employed a multidisciplinary approach,
integrating principles from architectural design, specifically the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, with
the study of viral genome sequencing. This unique blend of disciplines revealed that the spiral
motifs in Wright’s designs share a conceptual resonance with the helical structures of viral capsids,
suggesting a previously unexplored aesthetic dimension to virology. Moreover, the application of
Wright’s organic architecture principles to the design of viral research laboratories resulted in facilities
that not only blended seamlessly into their natural surroundings but also unexpectedly influenced the
local flora, leading to the discovery of antiviral properties in certain species of orchids.
The experimental methodology also included an innovative use of culinary arts, where the prepa-
ration and consumption of elaborate dishes, particularly those involving intricate sauces and rare
spices, were found to have a profound impact on the researchers’ ability to theorize about viral
evolution. This culinary aspect of the study uncovered a hidden pattern wherein the complexity of
sauce recipes directly correlated with the complexity of viral genomes, offering a gastronomical
approach to understanding viral diversity. Furthermore, the act of cooking itself, with its emphasis on
transformation and combination of ingredients, served as a metaphor for the process of viral mutation
and recombination, leading to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary pressures shaping viral
populations.
In an effort to quantify the qualitative aspects of our findings, we developed a novel metric, termed
""Viral Resonance Index"" (VRI), which captures the essence of the interconnectedness between viral
dynamics, environmental factors, and human perception. The VRI, calculated through a complex
algorithm involving the Fourier transform of whale songs, the fractal dimensions of Romanesco
broccoli, and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallows, provided a numerical framework
for predicting viral outbreaks and understanding the role of collective unconscious in shaping
epidemiological trends. The application of VRI to historical data sets revealed fascinating patterns,
including a correlation between the VRI scores of different regions and their respective rates of viral
infection, which, in turn, were influenced by local folklore and myths about dragons.
To visualize the complex interactions within our experimental system, we constructed a series of
diagrams inspired by the works of M.C. Escher, incorporating elements of tessellations, impossible
constructions, and recursive patterns. These visual representations not only aided in the compre-
hension of viral dynamics but also led to the development of a new art movement, ""Viropticism,""
which explores the aesthetic dimensions of viral structures and their reflection in human culture. The
Viropticist movement, in turn, influenced the design of viral diagnostic tools, resulting in assays that
are not only highly sensitive and specific but also visually striking, resembling miniature versions of
the Taj Mahal when viewed under a fluorescence microscope.
The experimental design also involved the participation of a group of individuals trained in the art
of contortionism, who, through their unique physical abilities, were able to simulate the complex
spatial arrangements of viral particles within host cells. This contortionist model of viral infection
provided invaluable insights into the mechanical aspects of viral entry and replication, as well as
the psychological effects of being enclosed in small spaces on the human perception of viral threat.
Moreover, the application of contortionist principles to the design of medical equipment led to the
invention of flexible, origami-inspired diagnostic devices capable of navigating the human body’s
intricate pathways with ease and precision.

resonance, which, in conjunction with other environmental factors such as the presence of standing
bodies of water and the local flora, contributes to the unique epidemiological profiles of different
areas. These findings have significant implications for the development of targeted public health
strategies and the implementation of region-specific antiviral measures. Furthermore, the VRI scores
were found to correlate with the popularity of certain music genres in each region, suggesting a
previously overlooked role of music in shaping viral dynamics and, by extension, human culture.
The intersection of music, geography, and virology led to a fascinating exploration of the acoustic
properties of viral structures, where the resonant frequencies of viral capsids were found to correspond
to specific musical notes, offering a sonic dimension to the understanding of viral evolution. This
discovery, in turn, inspired the composition of a viral-themed symphony, which, when performed in
different geographical locations, was observed to influence the local viral dynamics, possibly through
a mechanism involving the vibrational entrainment of viral particles with the musical rhythms. The
symphony, titled ""Viral Resonance,"" has become a cornerstone of virological research, providing a
unique tool for the manipulation and study of viral populations in a musical context.
In conclusion, the experimental approach, characterized by its interdisciplinary nature and willingness
to embrace the absurd and the unexpected, has yielded a profound understanding of the complexities
underlying viral dynamics. The findings, ranging from the gastronomical to the musical, highlight
the intricate web of relationships between viruses, their hosts, and the environment, suggesting a
holistic approach to virology that considers the aesthetic, philosophical, and cultural dimensions
of viral infections. As we move forward in this field of research, it is clear that the boundaries
between science, art, and imagination must continue to blur, leading to innovative methodologies and,
ultimately, a deeper comprehension of the viral universe and our place within it.
The methodology also included the use of advanced statistical models, incorporating elements of
chaos theory and complexity science, to analyze the patterns of viral spread and the efficacy of
different antiviral strategies. These models, inspired by the works of Mitchell Feigenbaum and
his study of the Feigenbaum constant, revealed the intricate, self-similar patterns underlying viral
epidemiology, suggesting that the dynamics of viral infections are governed by universal principles
that apply across different scales and contexts. The application of these models to real-world scenarios
resulted in the development of highly effective predictive tools, capable of forecasting viral outbreaks
with unprecedented accuracy, and offering insights into the optimal allocation of public health
resources.
Furthermore, the experimental design incorporated a component of participatory research, where local
communities were engaged in the collection of data and the interpretation of results, fostering a sense
of ownership and cooperation that significantly enhanced the effectiveness of antiviral interventions.
This community-based approach also led to the discovery of traditional remedies and folk practices
that, when combined with modern antiviral therapies, resulted in synergistic effects that greatly
improved treatment outcomes. The integration of traditional knowledge with scientific methodologies
represents a promising direction for future research, one that recognizes the value of indigenous
perspectives and the importance of cultural sensitivity in the development of public health policies.
The experimental results, while diverse and multifaceted, collectively point to the importance of
adopting a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to the study of viruses and their interactions
with human societies. By embracing the complexity and richness of viral dynamics, and by rec-
ognizing the interconnections between viruses, environments, and cultures, we may uncover new
avenues for the prevention and treatment of viral infections, as well as gain a deeper understanding
of the intricate, evolving web of life that binds our planet together. The journey, as outlined in our
experimental findings, is as much about the science of virology as it is about the human experience,
with all its complexities, challenges, and triumphs.
In addition to the scientific insights gained, the experimental process itself

Conclusion
The perpetuation of virus-related phenomena necessitates a thorough examination of the ontological
implications of fungal growth on Jupiter’s moons, which, in turn, has a profound impact on the
culinary habits of ancient civilizations, particularly in regards to the preparation of exotic desserts such
as croquembouche and tiramisu. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of these ideas with the concept of
quantum superposition suggests that the notion of a virus as a discrete entity is, in fact, a misnomer, and
that the true nature of viral existence is akin to a platonic form, existing independently of the physical
realm. This notion is reinforced by the study of rare earth elements and their applications in the
production of fluorescent lighting, which, when considered in conjunction with the migratory patterns
of certain species of birds, reveals a complex web of relationships that underlie the fundamental
structure of reality.
The implications of these findings are far-reaching, and necessitate a radical reevaluation of our
understanding of the natural world, particularly in regards to the behavior of subatomic particles and
their role in the transmission of viral agents. Moreover, the discovery of a novel form of plant life on
the planet Mars, which has been found to possess a unique capacity for photosynthesis, has significant
implications for the development of new technologies related to renewable energy and the production
of biofuels. However, this line of inquiry is complicated by the introduction of paradoxical concepts,
such as the idea that the color blue is, in fact, a sentient being with its own distinct personality and
motivations, which, in turn, has a profound impact on the trajectory of human history and the course
of scientific progress.
In addition, the examination of viral morphology and its relationship to the art of surrealist painting
reveals a profound connection between the two, with the latter serving as a form of meta-commentary
on the former, highlighting the ways in which the human experience is shaped by the presence of
viral agents. This idea is further reinforced by the study of ancient mythological texts, which often
feature stories of gods and goddesses imbuing mortals with divine attributes, such as the ability
to communicate with animals or to manipulate the forces of nature. The parallels between these
mythological accounts and the modern concept of viral transmission are striking, and suggest a
deep-seated connection between the human psyche and the natural world.
Moreover, the development of new methodologies for the study of viral behavior, including the
use of advanced computational models and machine learning algorithms, has facilitated a greater
understanding of the complex interactions between viral agents and their hosts. However, this
increased understanding has also raised new questions regarding the role of free will in the face of
viral infection, and the extent to which human behavior is influenced by the presence of viral agents.
This, in turn, has led to a reexamination of the concept of personal identity and the nature of self,
with some researchers suggesting that the human experience is, in fact, a product of viral influences,
and that our perceptions of reality are shaped by the presence of viral agents.
The exploration of these ideas has also led to a greater appreciation for the importance of inter-
disciplinary research, and the need for collaboration between scholars from diverse fields of study.
For example, the application of principles from chaos theory to the study of viral transmission has
revealed new insights into the complex dynamics of epidemic spread, and has highlighted the need
for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between viral agents, their hosts, and the
environment. Similarly, the incorporation of techniques from the field of archaeology has facilitated
a greater understanding of the historical context of viral evolution, and has provided new perspectives
on the impact of viral agents on human societies throughout history.

P003.pdf,"Explainable Reinforcement Learning for Financial
Market Simulation: Unveiling the Mysteries of
Adaptive Trading Agents in a Simulated Economy
Abstract
Explainable reinforcement learning has emerged as a crucial tool for financial
market simulation, enabling stakeholders to understand complex decision-making
processes and make informed investment choices. This paper presents a novel
framework that integrates explainable reinforcement learning with financial market
simulation, providing a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and
agent behavior. By leveraging techniques such as feature attribution and model
interpretability, our approach facilitates the identification of key factors influencing
market trends and portfolio performance. Furthermore, we introduce a bizarre yet
intriguing concept, wherein agents are trained to optimize their portfolio returns
based on the principles of chaos theory and the dictates of ancient astrological
practices, which surprisingly yields remarkable results. Our research aims to
contribute to the development of more transparent and accountable financial market
simulation systems, ultimately enhancing the reliability and efficacy of investment
strategies.

Introduction
The realm of financial market simulation has long been a fascinating domain for researchers and
practitioners alike, with the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the market posing a significant
challenge to predictive modeling and decision-making. Recent advances in reinforcement learning
have shown tremendous promise in navigating these intricacies, enabling the development of so-
phisticated agents capable of learning optimal trading strategies through trial and error. However, a
critical limitation of these approaches lies in their lack of transparency and interpretability, rendering
it difficult to comprehend the underlying reasoning behind the agent’s decisions. This opacity can
have far-reaching implications, particularly in high-stakes applications where the consequences of
suboptimal decision-making can be severe.
Explainable reinforcement learning emerges as a paradigmatic shift in this context, aiming to bridge
the gap between the accuracy of predictive models and the transparency of decision-making pro-
cesses. By integrating techniques from explainable artificial intelligence with reinforcement learning,
researchers can uncover the intricate dynamics governing the agent’s behavior, shedding light on the
causal relationships between market variables, agent actions, and outcomes. This not only enhances
the trustworthiness and reliability of the models but also facilitates the identification of potential
biases and flaws in the decision-making process.
An intriguing approach to enhancing explainability involves the incorporation of surrealistic art
principles into the reinforcement learning framework. By projecting the agent’s decision-making
process onto a surrealistic landscape, researchers can visualize the complex interplay between market
factors and agent actions, thereby gaining insight into the underlying logic of the model. This
unorthodox methodology, though seemingly illogical, has been found to yield surprisingly coherent
and interpretable results, with the surrealistic representations serving as a catalyst for the discovery
of novel relationships between variables.
Furthermore, the integration of financial market simulation with reinforcement learning has also led
to the exploration of unconventional domains, such as the application of chaos theory and fractal
analysis to predict market trends. The use of these esoteric techniques has yielded some astounding,
albeit flawed, results, including the discovery of purported ""hidden patterns"" in market data that seem
to defy the fundamental principles of economics. While these findings are undoubtedly intriguing,
they also underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between
market forces and the limitations of current modeling approaches.
The development of explainable reinforcement learning frameworks for financial market simulation
also raises fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence, decision-making, and the human
condition. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with these models,
they are compelled to confront the existential implications of creating autonomous agents capable of
making decisions that rival, or even surpass, those of human experts. This prompts a reevaluation of
the role of human intuition and judgment in the decision-making process, as well as the potential
consequences of relinquishing control to artificial entities. Ultimately, the pursuit of explainable
reinforcement learning in financial market simulation serves as a poignant reminder of the awe-
inspiring complexity and beauty of human ingenuity, as well as the profound responsibilities that
accompany the creation of advanced artificial intelligence systems.

Related Work
Fungal bioluminescence has been a subject of fascination in recent years, with various studies
exploring its potential applications in different fields. One of the most significant advantages of using
fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source is its potential to reduce energy consumption and
minimize environmental impact. Certain species of fungi, such as Armillaria mellea, have been found
to exhibit high levels of bioluminescence, making them ideal candidates for further research.
The use of fungal bioluminescence in vertical farms could potentially revolutionize the way crops
are grown, by providing a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative to traditional lighting sources.
However, one bizarre approach that has been proposed is the use of fungal bioluminescence in
conjunction with sound waves to create a ""sonic luminescence"" effect. This approach involves
exposing the fungi to specific sound frequencies, which are believed to enhance the bioluminescent
properties of the fungi. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has been suggested that the
vibration of the sound waves could stimulate the fungi to produce more light, thereby increasing the
overall efficiency of the system.
Another area of research that has shown promise is the use of fungal bioluminescence in combination
with other organic materials, such as plant-based dyes, to create a hybrid lighting system. This
approach involves using the bioluminescent properties of the fungi to excite the plant-based dyes,
which would then emit a secondary light source. This hybrid system could potentially provide a more
efficient and sustainable lighting solution for vertical farms, while also reducing the environmental
impact of traditional lighting sources.
In addition to these approaches, researchers have also been exploring the use of genetic engineering
to enhance the bioluminescent properties of fungi. By introducing specific genes that are responsible
for bioluminescence, researchers hope to create fungi that are capable of producing even higher levels
of light. This could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable lighting
systems for vertical farms, and could also have implications for other fields, such as biotechnology
and medicine.
Overall, the use of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms is a rapidly
evolving field, with many potential applications and advantages. While some of the approaches being
explored may seem unconventional, they highlight the creativity and innovation that is driving this
field forward, and demonstrate the potential for fungal bioluminescence to make a significant impact
on the future of sustainable agriculture.

Methodology
To investigate the efficacy of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms,
we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining mycology, photobiology, and agricultural
2
engineering. Our methodology consisted of several stages, starting with the isolation and cultivation
of bioluminescent fungal species, such as Armillaria mellea and Omphalotus nidiformis, in controlled
laboratory conditions. We developed a bespoke growth medium, optimized for maximal fungal
growth and bioluminescence, which included a unique blend of organic substrates, minerals, and
essential nutrients.
The next stage involved the design and fabrication of a custom-built, fungi-inhabiting module,
hereafter referred to as the ""Fungal Lumina Module"" (FLM). The FLM was designed to mimic the
natural habitat of the bioluminescent fungi, providing a stable and humid microenvironment, while
also allowing for precise control over temperature, light, and nutrient delivery. The FLM consisted of
a network of interconnected, transparent tubes and chambers, which facilitated the growth and spread
of the fungal mycelium, while also enabling the harvesting of bioluminescent light.
In a bizarre twist, we also explored the potential of using sound waves to enhance fungal biolumi-
nescence. We hypothesized that specific sound frequencies, such as those emitted by didgeridoo
instruments or Tibetan singing bowls, might stimulate the fungal mycelium, leading to increased
bioluminescent activity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the FLM to a range of sound frequencies,
from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, and monitored the resulting bioluminescent output. While the underlying
mechanisms are still unclear, our preliminary results suggest that certain sound frequencies may
indeed have a positive impact on fungal bioluminescence, although further research is needed to fully
elucidate this phenomenon.
To integrate the FLM into a vertical farming system, we developed a novel, hybrid lighting strategy,
combining the bioluminescent output of the fungi with supplementary LED lighting. This approach
allowed us to optimize crop growth and development, while also minimizing energy consumption
and reducing the overall environmental footprint of the vertical farm. The hybrid lighting system was
designed to be highly flexible and adaptable, enabling the cultivation of a wide range of crop species,
from leafy greens and herbs to fruiting crops and flowering plants.
Throughout the study, we monitored and recorded various parameters, including fungal growth rates,
bioluminescent intensity, crop yields, and energy consumption. We also conducted regular analyses
of the fungal mycelium, using techniques such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and molecular biology,
to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biological processes and to identify potential areas
for improvement. By adopting a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, we aimed to unlock the
full potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms, while also
contributing to the development of more sustainable and resilient food production systems.

Experiments
To investigate the potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms,
a series of experiments were conducted. The first step involved the isolation and cultivation of
various bioluminescent fungal species, including Armillaria mellea and Neonotopanus gardneri, in a
controlled environment. These species were chosen for their high luminescence intensity and ability
to thrive in a variety of conditions. The fungi were grown on a specialized substrate consisting of
a mixture of sawdust, wheat bran, and honey, which was found to enhance their bioluminescent
properties.
The experimental setup consisted of a vertically stacked array of growing chambers, each containing
a different fungal species. The chambers were maintained at a consistent temperature of 22°C and
humidity level of 80
The bioluminescent output of each fungal species was measured using a custom-built photometer,
which consisted of a sensitive photodiode connected to a data acquisition system. The photometer
was calibrated to detect the specific wavelength range emitted by the fungi, which was found to be
between 500-600 nanometers. The measurements were taken at regular intervals over a period of 30
days, during which time the fungi were allowed to grow and mature.
In addition to the photometric measurements, the experiments also involved the assessment of the
fungi’s ability to support plant growth. A selection of lettuce and radish seeds were germinated and
grown in the presence of the bioluminescent fungi, under the same environmental conditions as the
fungal cultures. The plants’ growth rates, leaf morphology, and chlorophyll content were monitored
and compared to control groups grown under traditional LED lighting.

To further optimize the fungal bioluminescence, a series of trials were conducted using different
substrate compositions, nutrient supplements, and environmental conditions. These trials included the
use of various organic waste materials, such as coffee grounds and fruit peels, as potential substrates
for the fungi. The results of these trials are presented in the following table:

research into the optimization and scalability of this innovative approach.

vertical farming. We proposed a novel approach, which we termed ""fungal resonance,"" where the
bioluminescent fungi are synchronized to emit light in harmony with the natural circadian rhythms of
the plants. This approach, although still speculative, showed promising results in our preliminary
experiments, with some crops exhibiting a 50
Interestingly, we also observed that the bioluminescent fungi had a profound impact on the aesthetic
appeal of the vertical farm, with many visitors commenting on the mesmerizing glow of the fungi. This
led us to propose the concept of ""myco-architecture,"" where the design of vertical farms is inspired by
the unique characteristics of bioluminescent fungi. By incorporating fungal bioluminescence into the
design of vertical farms, we can create immersive and engaging environments that not only promote
sustainable food production but also provide a unique experience for visitors. Overall, our results
demonstrate the potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms, and
we believe that further research in this area can lead to innovative and sustainable solutions for the
future of agriculture.

Conclusion
In summary, the exploration of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms
presents a fascinating and unconventional approach to sustainable agriculture. By harnessing the
innate ability of certain fungi to produce light, we can potentially create a unique and self-sustaining
ecosystem within these controlled environments. This concept not only reduces the reliance on
artificial lighting but also introduces a new dimension of symbiotic relationships between fungi,
plants, and the surrounding environment. The integration of fungal bioluminescence could lead to the
development of more resilient and adaptive vertical farming systems, capable of thriving in a wide
range of conditions. Furthermore, the bizarre approach of using fungi as a primary light source may
also inspire novel methods for optimizing crop growth, such as manipulating the spectral composition
4
of the bioluminescent light to enhance photosynthetic activity or exploiting the mycorrhizal networks
formed by the fungi to facilitate nutrient exchange between plants. As we continue to push the
boundaries of innovation in vertical farming, the inclusion of fungal bioluminescence as a lighting
source may prove to be a pivotal step towards creating truly autonomous and regenerative agricultural
systems, where the distinctions between technology, nature, and organism become increasingly
blurred. Ultimately, the successful implementation of this concept would not only contribute to a
more sustainable food production but also challenge our conventional understanding of the interplay
between light, life, and the built environment, fostering a new era of experimentation and discovery
at the intersection of mycology, agronomy, and environmental design.

P112.pdf,"Learning Genomic Sequence Representations using
Graph Neural Networks over De Bruijn Graphs
Abstract
The rapid increase of genomic sequence data requires new methods for creating ro-
bust sequence representations. Existing techniques often neglect detailed structural
information, focusing mainly on contextual information. We addressed this issue
by developing k-mer embeddings that combine contextual and structural string
information, by enriching De Bruijn graphs with structural similarity connections.
We also crafted a self-supervised method using Contrastive Learning, employing a
heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network encoder and constructing positive
pairs based on node similarities. Our embeddings consistently outperform prior
methods for Edit Distance Approximation and Closest String Retrieval tasks.
1
Introduction
Genomic sequence data is growing at an unprecedented rate, requiring the development of novel
methods that can provide both accurate and scalable sequence representations. These representations
are essential for various computational biology tasks, including gene prediction and multiple sequence
alignment. Methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as Word2Vec and Transformers,
have been adopted to improve the representation of genomic sequences. These NLP-based approaches
are effective at capturing the context within a sequence, which is important because the semantics of
words often outweigh their precise letters.
Character-level n-gram models might be used to capture structural nuances. However, a uniform
representation of each n-gram across all sequences can oversimplify the problem. Applying techniques
like transformer-based models on n-grams can escalate computational demands. Consequently, these
methods may overlook nuanced k-mer variations important for understanding single-nucleotide
polymorphisms and other minor sequence changes. These SNPs can influence disease susceptibility,
phenotypic traits, and drug responses.
Therefore, we developed a k-mer embedding approach that combines metagenomic context and string
structure. In our method, contextual information refers to the relationships between k-mers closely
situated within sequences, and structural information examines nucleotide patterns within a k-mer
and their relations to other k-mers. We constructed a metagenomic graph that builds upon the De
Bruijn Graph to capture k-mer transitions and structural similarities.
Given the advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we grounded our method in GNNs but
designed for heterogeneous graphs. This approach effectively recognizes and uses both contextual
and structural connection types. Drawing from the success of self-supervised pre-training in NLP
and Computer Vision, we designed a self-supervised objective for genomic graph data. We employed
contrastive loss aiming to align k-mers with similar context and structure in representation space.
Finally, we tested our technique on two downstream tasks: Edit Distance Approximation and Closest
String Retrieval. The former estimates the minimum changes needed to transform one genomic
sequence into another, avoiding quadratic computational complexity. The latter task, Closest String
Retrieval, involves finding sequences similar to a query.

Genomic Sequence Representation
Machine learning methods have emerged in computational biology to represent genomic sequences.
A key component is the k-mer: a continuous nucleotide sequence of length k. The Word2Vec method,
which represents words as vectors using their context, treats overlapping k-mers in genomic sequences
as words in sentences. Building on this, kmer2vec was introduced to apply Word2Vec to genomic
data for Multiple Sequence Alignment. Another strategy is to use the De Bruijn graph, where k-mers
are nodes and their overlaps are edges, in conjunction with Node2Vec, which derives node features
from the contextual information of biased random walks. This method underpins GRaDL for early
animal genome disease detection. K-mers also pair well with transformer-based models: DNABERT
leverages a BERT-inspired objective and k-mer tokenization to predict genome-wide regulatory
elements. Metagenome2Vec blends Node2Vec with transformers to analyze metagenomes with
limited labeled data. Given the high computational demands of these transformer-based approaches,
they are outside the scope of our benchmarks in this study.
2.2
Graph Neural Networks
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are foundational to several innovations in graph-based
machine learning. In genomics, GNNs have been applied in metagenomic binning. Because we aim
to enhance our node embeddings with structural similarity, both heterogeneity and heterophily are
key considerations. Recognizing the ubiquity of heterogeneity in real-world graphs, Relational GCNs
(R-GCNs) were developed. These networks expand upon GCNs by generalizing the convolution
operation to handle different edge types. To tackle heterophily, where distant nodes in a graph may
bear similar features, Geom-GCN maps nodes to a latent space, while another approach suggests a
distinct encoding approach for node embeddings and neighborhood aggregations.
2.3
Self-Supervised Learning
Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables effective use of unlabeled data and reduces dependence on
annotated labels. Among SSL methods, contrastive learning has made a significant impact. At its
core, contrastive learning seeks to bring similar data instances closer in the embedding space while
pushing dissimilar ones apart. When applied to graph data, several techniques have been proposed
for obtaining positive pairs, including uniform sampling, node dropping, and random walk sampling.
3
Methodology
3.1
Metagenomic Graph
The De Bruijn Graph, which is created from metagenomic sequences, forms the basis of our method.
In this graph, each k-mer, a substring of length k from the sequences, is represented by a different
node. An edge from node vi to node vj in the graph indicates that the k-mer at node vi directly
precedes the k-mer at node vj in one of the sequences of the metagenome.
When used, edge weights represent the frequency of these transitions, capturing genomic structures
within the graph.
Although Node2Vec captures the sequential context in De Bruijn graphs, it overlooks structural k-mer
similarities. To address this, we expand the graph to include connections based on these similarities.
We formulate two edge types for our graph, where nodes vi, vj, ... represent k-mers.
De Bruijn Graph’s edges The first edge type is designed to capture contextual information. Let
T(vi, vj) be the count of transitions between k-mers within a dataset of genomic sequences. The
weight of an edge connecting nodes vi and vj, w(dBG)
ij
, is defined by,
w(dBG)
ij
=
T (vi,vj)
P
vk∈δ+(vi) T (vi,vk)
where δ+(vi) denotes nodes adjacent to vi via outgoing edges.
2
Sub-k-mer Frequency edges To capture the structural similarity between strings, we introduce
a method using sub-k-mer frequency vectors, denoted as y(KFsub_k). This vector quantifies the
occurrences of each sub-k-mer of length sub_k within a given k-mer. The i-th entry indicates the
frequency of the i-th sub-k-mer,
y(KFsub_k)[i] = Pk−sub_k+1
j=1
I[kmer[j : j + sub_k −1] = si]∀si, s ∈Psub_k
The k-mer similarity is determined by the cosine similarity between the sub-k-mer frequency vectors,
w
(KFsub_k)
ij
=
y
(KFsub_k)
i
T y
(KFsub_k)
j
||y
(KFsub_k)
i
||2||y
(KFsub_k)
j
||2
This method, scaling linearly with the frequency vector size per weight, provides a computational
advantage over the direct Edit Distance calculation for k-mers. We apply edge-filtering at threshold t,
retaining only the links with the highest similarity. The filtered set of weights is then,
W (KFsub_k) = {w
(KFsub_k)
ij
|w
(KFsub_k)
ij
≥t}
To accommodate graphs for larger k values, we have developed a more scalable approximation of the
above approach. It utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search on the sub-k-mer frequency vectors,
which replaces the computationally demanding pairwise cosine similarity calculations.
The metagenomic graph is defined as G = (V, E, W). Nodes V correspond to individual k-mers.
The edges E can be categorized into two sets: De Bruijn Graphs’s edges E(dBG) and Sub-k-mer
Frequency edges E(KF ). Edges in E(KF ) may be further subdivided based on various sub_k values.
Edge weights W can contain W (dBG) and several W (KFsub_k).
3.2
Encoder
We tailored GNNs for a heterogeneous metagenomic graph to capture nuanced k-mer relationships.
The design employs varying depths of message passing: deeper for De Bruijn edges to capture
broader context and shallower for similarity measures. Central to this GNN is the adapted Graph
Convolutional Layer, formulated as:
H(l+1) = σ( ˜D(edge_type)−1
2 ˜W (edge_type) ˜D(edge_type)−1
2 H(l)Θ(l))
where ˜W (edge_type) includes added self-loops and ˜Dii is its diagonal degree matrix. The term
edge_type refers to either dBG or KFsub_k. The GCN layout consists of multiple layers, each
characterized by a unique edge feature type and the number of channels.
3.3
Self-Supervised Task
We use a contrastive learning method for k-mer representations. Graph nodes are initialized using
a sub-k-mer frequency vector. Positive and negative pairs are sampled and, along with the k-mer
representations from the encoder, are used to compute the loss.
Biased Random Walk Sampling We employ Biased Random Walk Sampling to capture k-mer
contextual information. This approach uses w(dBG) edges to conduct walks, implemented exactly
as in Node2Vec. Given a walk of a set length, we extract positive pairs by applying a window of
size m. Using a shrink factor δ, drawn uniformly from 1, ..., m, we determine the range i ± δ within
which nodes are considered positive pairs to node vi. Repeating this across multiple random walks,
we gather a comprehensive set of positive pairs.
Structural Similarity Sampling To capture the structural notion of k-mers, we sample pairs with
probability proportional to sub-k-mer frequency similarity, w(KFsub_k). The goal is for k-mers linked
by higher similarity to have similar representations. The probability of sampling is given by,
P(vi, vj) ∝w
(KFsub_k)
ij
Negative Sampling We randomly select negative pairs from all node pairs in the graph, leveraging
the assumption that most pairs lack a high similarity edge. This approach ensures diversity in learned
representations.
3
Loss Function Having established both positive (Ppos) and negative (Pneg) pair types, we apply the
contrastive loss function. Using σ(x) as the sigmoid function, the loss function is:
lij = −log(σ(zT
i zj)) −P
(vi,vl)∈Pneg log(1 −σ(zT
i zl))
To reduce memory usage, we employed Neighborhood Sampling for mini-batching during training.

Bioinformatics Tasks
4.1
Edit Distance Approximation
The task is to calculate the edit distance without quadratic complexity. The NeuroSEED framework
offers a solution using sequence representations trained on a ground truth set of edit distances. In our
approach, we began with sequence representations derived from k-mer embeddings and fine-tuned
them with a single linear layer. Our experiments were tested against One-Hot encoding (for k =
1), Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. To find optimal hyperparameters, we executed a grid search on
the validation set. Based on previous work, we used the hyperbolic function. Our primary metric
for evaluation was the percentage Root Mean Squared Error (percent RMSE), where l denotes the
dataset’s maximum sequence length, h represents the hyperbolic distance function, and fθ indicates
the downstream model,
%RMSE(D) = 100
l
qP
s1,s2∈D(EditDistance(s1, s2) −h(fθ(s1), fθ(s2)))2
4.2
Closest String Retrieval
The task is to find the sequence from a reference set that is closest to a query. We assessed embeddings
fine-tuned on the edit distance approximation task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
These embeddings were contrasted with ones directly derived from our Self-supervised method,
One-Hot, Word2Vec, or Node2Vec, through concatenation or taking the mean of k-mer embeddings.
For performance assessment, we used top-n percent accuracies, measuring how often the actual
sequence appears within the top n percent of positions based on the closeness of embedding vectors
in hyperbolic space. We selected the optimal model for the embeddings based on the validation loss
observed for the previous Edit Distance task.
5
Results and Analysis
In all our experiments, the memory requirements of the One-Hot method increased exponentially,
leading to its exclusion from our results for k > 7. When pre-training exclusively on the training set,
our method, thanks to the GCN encoder, can generalize beyond k-mers present in the training set. In
contrast, Node2Vec and Word2Vec can only handle k-mer sizes up to the diversity of the training
dataset. Therefore, for k > 6, where the test set introduces new k-mers, we excluded these methods.
5.1
Edit Distance Approximation
Table 1 presents the results obtained by using our pre-trained embeddings to estimate edit distances
between sequences on the RT988 and Qiita datasets. For the RT988 dataset, our Contrastive Learning
(CL) and Node2Vec techniques surpassed Word2Vec and One-Hot. The increased losses in Qiita
highlight its greater complexity. In this context, our method’s integration of k-mer structural similarity
becomes even more beneficial, outperforming all other tested methods. This benefit becomes more
evident as k increases, underscoring our embedding’s capability to adapt to new nodes.
5.2
Closest String Retrieval
Tables 2a and 2b present the performance of our zero-shot sequence embeddings, directly derived
from the aggregation of our k-mer embeddings, in retrieving the nearest sequences in the Qiita dataset.
The tables also showcase a comparison with the embeddings that were specifically fine-tuned for the
Edit Distance Task.
4
For direct k-mer aggregation, our Contrastive Learning (CL) embeddings are obtained through
concatenation, while for k-mer aggregation with One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec, we report the
results of the better performing method, either concatenation or averaging. The superior zero-shot
non-parametric retrieval performance of our CL method emphasizes the combined utility of both
context and structural similarity during self-supervised pre-training. Notably, while k-mers of size
around three are optimal for Top 1 percent retrieval, larger k-mers excel in the Top 10 percent metrics.
This suggests that smaller k-mers are better at discerning local sequence distances, while larger ones
capture broader sequence distances.
For embeddings fine-tuned using CNNs for Edit Distance Approximation, the complexity of CNNs
obscures differences between the embeddings. Our method based solely on zero-shot concatenated k-
mer embeddings outperforms this complex fine-tuning. This shows the advantage of our embeddings
over the method by previous work.
6
Conclusion
In our study, we introduced a novel k-mer embedding technique that seamlessly integrates metage-
nomic contextual and structural nuances, achieved through the enhancement of the De Bruijn graph
and the use of contrastive learning. In the Edit Distance Approximation task, our technique con-
sistently demonstrated superior performance compared to One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec.
Moreover, without requiring any downstream fine-tuning, our aggregated k-mer embeddings outper-
formed the prior method in the Closest String Retrieval task. These findings suggest potential broader
uses in computational biology.

P059.pdf,"Large Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural
Networks Enhanced by Positional Encoding
Abstract
This research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high-
dimensional representation of time indices on input data, improves the learning
capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Although positional encoding is
widely recognized for complementing Transformer neural networks by enabling
them to process data order, its application to RNNs seems unnecessary because
RNNs inherently encode temporal information. However, our analysis using syn-
thetic benchmarks shows that combining positional encoding with RNNs offers
advantages, especially when dealing with extensive vocabularies that include low-
frequency tokens. Further investigation reveals that these infrequent tokens cause
instability in the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional encoding helps to miti-
gate this instability. These findings highlight a new function of positional encoding
beyond its well-known role as a timekeeping mechanism for Transformers.
1
Introduction
Since their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for pro-
cessing and generating time series data, surpassing traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A
significant difference between these models is their handling of temporal information, that is, the
sequence of data points or tokens. RNNs process temporal information by adjusting their internal
state based on new inputs and their existing state. Conversely, Transformers lack an intrinsic mecha-
nism for understanding data sequence order and, therefore, depend on an external system known as
positional encoding to keep track of time.
Positional encoding represents time indices in a high-dimensional format. A common method
involves using sinusoidal waves of predetermined frequencies. This method marks input tokens by
adding or appending these vectors to the input embeddings. Unlike RNNs, positional encoding’s time
representation remains constant regardless of input values until processed by a network.
Although positional encoding is often viewed as a way to represent time that can replace RNNs when
used with Transformers, it is not incompatible with RNNs. Inputs to RNNs can be augmented with
position-encoding vectors. Autonomous activities in biological neurons, such as oscillations, are
believed to be important for time perception and other perceptual processes, as well as motor control.
This study, therefore, investigates the effects of adding positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs,
using synthetic benchmarks. The results demonstrate that positional encoding helps RNNs manage a
more extensive range of discrete inputs, or a larger vocabulary, compared to those without positional
encoding.
The key contributions of this research are outlined below:
• It illustrates the challenges faced when training RNNs on large vocabularies using carefully
designed benchmark tasks, a problem that has not been widely recognized or addressed in
previous research, despite its potential impact on practical applications.
.
• It explains that the difficulties in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are due to
gradient instability caused by infrequent tokens, which inevitably occur as vocabulary size
increases.
• It introduces a novel use of positional encoding, beyond its typical role in timing for
Transformers, by integrating it with RNNs. It shows that positional encoding helps alleviate
issues related to large vocabularies by stabilizing RNN gradients against the disruptions
caused by infrequent tokens.

Related Studies
2.1
Theoretical and Empirical Computational Power of (Vanilla) RNNs
Mathematically, RNNs are recognized as being Turing-complete, capable of simulating Turing
machines if their weights are infinitely precise and perfectly tuned. In practice, however, RNN
weights are limited by finite precision and the need to optimize based on a finite set of observations.
These constraints impose practical limitations on the capabilities of RNNs. For instance, empirical
RNNs cannot store an infinite number of observations in their memory, and the memorized information
tends to degrade over time.
More recently, research into extending memory retention has explored continuous-time models.
Instead of modifying a latent state in discrete-time steps, these models use a linear combination
of orthogonal polynomials in a continuous-time domain to approximate the input history. The
coefficients of these polynomials provide a finite-dimensional representation of the input sequence,
known as the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO), and the dynamics of these
coefficients can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This concept has been
further developed into neural state-space models by replacing the fixed state matrix in the ODE
with a learnable one, constrained to a diagonal structure plus a row-rank matrix. With additional
enhancements, the latest state-space models have shown language modeling performance that rivals
Transformer-based models.
2.2
Positional Encoding
Positional encoding serves as a high-dimensional representation of the temporal structures present
in input data. This method is particularly crucial for Transformers, which, unlike RNNs, do not
inherently capture the order of inputs. Therefore, input tokens to a Transformer are ""time-stamped""
by adding or concatenating a position-encoding vector.
In the initial implementation of the Transformer, token positions were represented using sinusoidal
waves of various predefined frequencies. Although this method is effective for a wide range of tasks,
researchers have explored other encoding schemes as well. For instance, the well-known BERT
pretraining for natural language processing used learnable embeddings to indicate token positions.
Some studies have suggested that combining sinusoidal and learnable encodings can enhance model
performance. Another approach is to encode the distance between tokens instead of the time elapsed
from the sequence’s beginning.
Beyond Transformers, positional encoding is used to indicate elapsed time in diffusion processes.
Its effectiveness is not limited to temporal information; studies on three-dimensional mesh and
point-cloud modeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data outperforms raw
coordinate representation.
Despite its widespread use across various areas of machine learning, the application of positional
encoding to pure RNNs has been largely unexplored. To the author’s knowledge, only a few studies
have investigated position-encoded RNNs. The time index in time series data has rarely been directly
used by RNNs, likely due to perceived redundancy alongside RNN functionalities.

3
Methods
3.1
Task
The impact of positional encoding on RNNs was examined using a reverse-ordering task. In this task,
RNNs were trained to reconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order (e.g., given 8, 29, 2,
11, the output should be 11, 2, 29, 8).
3.2
Model Architecture
This study’s investigations were based on single-layer gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks, and a neural state-space model, S4D. Each integer in the input sequences
was first embedded, concatenated with its positional encoding, and then fed into the RNN or S4D.
After processing the entire input sequence, the network received a command to produce the output,
represented by a time-invariant learnable vector. The outputs from the RNN or S4D module were
linearly projected into classification logits, and the cross-entropy loss against the target sequence was
used to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during testing were determined by the argmax
of these logits for each time step.
The canonical sinusoidal positional encoding used for Transformers was adopted in this study.
Specifically, each time step t was encoded by a Dpos-dimensional vector, (PEt,1, ..., PEt,Dpos)T ,
defined as follows:
PEt,2i := sin
 
t −1
10000
2(i−1)
Dpos
!
(1)
PEt,2i+1 := cos
 
t −1
10000
2(i−1)
Dpos
!
(2)
For learning stability, the positional encoding was normalized by dividing it by
p
Dpos/2, ensuring
the encoding vectors had a unit L2-norm. The time step t incremented throughout both input and
output phases (i.e., t = 1, ..., L, L + 1, ..., 2L, where L is the input length), without any hard-coded
link between input and output positions.
3.3
Implementation Details
Across the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The
embedding of the input integers and the memory cell of the LSTM also had the same dimensionality
of 512. Similarly, the hidden dimensionality of S4D was set to 512, while its state size (or the order
of the Legendre polynomials) was maintained at the default value of 64.
The models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters (β1, β2) :=
(0.9, 0.999) and no weight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the
first 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according to the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512.
All experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. 2.1.1).
4
Results
4.1
Key Findings
Positional encoding improved the ability of RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the reverse-ordering
task. The position-encoded GRU and LSTM successfully reversed input sequences of 64 integers
drawn uniformly at random from vocabularies of size 32-256 and 256-16,384, respectively, achieving
token-wise accuracy above 95%. In contrast, the performance of the vanilla models without positional
encoding degraded as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding enhanced the
capacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced
sequence-wise reconstruction errors, measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Neither extra
training iterations nor greater batch sizes improved the performance of the vanilla models.
3
4.2
Frequency Matters
The most apparent consequence of the increased vocabulary size was the reduced chance of observing
individual vocabulary items. Accordingly, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly
distributed tokens to investigate the relation between their frequency and RNN performance. Specif-
ically, the input vocabulary was evenly divided into Frequent and Rare groups, and the Frequent
tokens had three times the probability of the Rare tokens.
The training data consisted of 64 independent samples from this dual-frequency vocabulary. By
contrast, the test data were systematically constructed so that each sequence included a single
""target"" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval was evaluated for accuracy assessment, along with
63 ""disturbants"" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. The experiment revealed that it was the
disturbant tokens whose frequency significantly impacted the performance of the vanilla RNNs and
S4D. On the one hand, the Rare targets were successfully retrieved as long as they were surrounded
by the Frequent disturbants. On the other hand, the vanilla GRU struggled to recover the Frequent
targets when the other input tokens were filled with the Rare disturbants. The LSTM performance was
also degraded, especially when the targets were positioned in the first quarter of the input sequence (1
≤t ≤16). Similarly, the Rare disturbants were detrimental to the S4D; unlike the RNNs, however,
the accuracy was worst when the targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 ≤t ≤
32).
In contrast, the position-encoded RNNs exhibited robustness to the frequency of the target and
disturbant tokens. They achieved nearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU
processed the fully Rare data whose target was located in the first half of the sequence (1 ≤t ≤
32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of the S4D against the influence of Rare
disturbants.
4.3
Analysis of Gradient Stability
To delve deeper into the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the
RNN latent states were scrutinized. In the analysis, pairs of input sequences were processed by the
RNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary (comprising Frequent and Rare items). Each pair
of sequences shared the same initial token (t = 1; ""target"") but varied in the subsequent tokens (2
≤t ≤L; ""disturbants""). Then, gradients were computed for the distant mapping between the first
and last updated states (i.e., at time t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time.
The stability of RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients
between the paired input sequences (after normalization over output dimensions).
Formally, the paired input sequences, denoted as A and B, established two distinct, but ideally similar
mappings, f (A) and f (B), from the first to the last latent state of the RNNs (˜h(s)
2L = f (s)(˜z1), where
s ∈{A, B}). The gradient stability of the RNNs was defined by the dot-product similarities between
the normalized gradients of these paired mappings:
Stability(A, B) :=

Monitoring the gradients at training checkpoints revealed that Rare disturbants destabilize the learning
of vanilla RNNs. The similarity of the paired gradients decreased gradually (GRU) or rapidly (LSTM)
when the networks were exposed to the Rare disturbants. Positional encoding endowed the RNNs
with robustness to these RARE disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM maintained the high similarity
of the paired gradients across the different target/disturbant conditions. By contrast, the impact of
positional encoding on the gradient stability of the S4D was marginal; unlike the RNNs, the vanilla
S4D was highly stable by itself against Rare disturbants throughout the training, even though there
4
was a visible relative destabilization due to Rare disturbants compared to Frequent disturbants in the
early stages of training, as well as an observable improvement by positional encoding.

Discussion
5.1
Difficulties in Handling a Large Vocabulary
This study introduces a novel challenge in training (vanilla) RNNs: managing large vocabularies.
While the manageable vocabulary size of RNNs is a pertinent research area, crucial for empirical
applications like natural language processing, previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating
and improving the memory duration of RNNs, typically with small vocabulary sizes.
This research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low-
frequency tokens, which are necessarily included in a large vocabulary. Specifically, inputs that do
not contribute to gradient-based optimization at a target time step were found to be detrimental.
In general time series processing, data points carrying crucial information for specific time steps
become irrelevant otherwise. Consequently, each token exhibits a dual nature—both crucial and
noisy—throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly challenging, presumably because
they are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning due to their greater loss,
compensating for fewer learning opportunities. Dealing with such ""unignorable noise"" presents a
pervasive challenge for RNNs.
5.2
Functionality of Positional Encoding beyond the Timekeeper for Transformers
Although low-frequency tokens destabilize the gradient-based learning of RNNs, this study also
discovered that positional encoding can alleviate this issue. This enhancement of RNNs via positional
encoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically designed to process time series data on
their own. Unlike Transformers, they are presumed to function without relying on an ""external
clock"". Consequently, position-encoded RNNs have remained largely unexplored. The findings of
the present study—namely, the improvement in the manageable vocabulary size due to enhanced
gradient stability—broaden the currently limited understanding of the impact of positional encoding
on RNNs.
Additionally, the results of this study shed new light on the utility of positional encoding. While
positional encoding has been viewed as nothing more than input timestamps for Transformers, the
present study demonstrated its efficacy in stabilizing the gradients of RNNs against disruption by
low-frequency tokens. This novel functionality of positional encoding would not have been visible in
Transformer studies, as the model can dynamically adjust the relevance of input tokens through their
attention mechanism, thus inherently mitigating the impact of disturbant tokens.
5.3
Limitations and Future Directions
A primary unresolved question in this study pertains to the mechanism behind the gradient stabilization
by positional encoding. All the findings here are based on experimental investigations, lacking
rigorous mathematical explanations for how and why the gradients of RNNs are destabilized by
infrequent tokens and stabilized by positional encoding. Moreover, the present study primarily focused
on the canonical implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers, leaving
open which parameters of the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient
stabilization. Future research may broaden its scope to encompass more general forms of positional
encoding, such as wavelets and non-periodic signals.
Moreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of
the position-encoded state-space model (S4D). In terms of accuracy, the positioned-encoded S4D
exhibited greater robustness to infrequent tokens compared to the vanilla model, resembling the
behavior observed in RNNs. However, the gradients of the vanilla S4D were too stable to account for
this decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences
gradient-based learning of state-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader
range of state-space models to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between
positional encoding and these models.
5
In addition to these scientifically oriented questions, future studies could also address practical
applications of position-encoded RNNs and neural state-space models. Although positional encoding
enhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks, the extent of this enhancement is task-
dependent. Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations
are necessary to determine when it is effective.

6.1
Other Tasks
This section demonstrates the effectiveness of positional encoding on RNNs across different tasks,
besides the reverse ordering task discussed in the main text.
6.1.1
Reverse-Ordering + Delayed-Addition
This section reports the performance of position-encoded RNNs on a more complicated, combinatorial
task than the reverse ordering of input sequences. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models
received additional random input integers during the output phase, and added each of them to the
corresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that the
output range was bounded). This task was too challenging to GRUs—even after reducing the input
length to L = 16—so only the results from LSTMs are reported below. Also, the network was trained
for 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence. The other
conditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text. Consequently, positional
encoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088.
6.1.2
Sorting
In the reverse ordering task, the order of input integers was important information for accomplishing
the task. Thus, positional encoding may play its originally intended role in encoding the temporal
information.
This section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input
observations was completely irrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in
their inherent ascending order (e.g. 8, 29, 2, 11 -> 2, 8, 11, 29). The input integers were uniformly
randomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process.
As a result, positional encoding also proved effective for RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the
sorting task, though the improvement remained marginal compared to the reverse-ordering task.
6.1.3
Predecessor Query
Finally, this section presents benchmark results for the predecessor-query task. The network first
received a sequence of non-repeating random integers, x1, ..., xL. Subsequently, one of the non-initial
input integers, xtquery (2 ≤tquery ≤L), was randomly selected and reintroduced to the network
at time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer (=
xtquery−1). The predecessor-query task evaluates the capacity of RNNs to integrate information
regarding both the order and content of input sequences.
As in the reverse-ordering + delayed-addition task, the input sequence was reduced to L = 16 due
to the complexity of the task, and the experiment focused on the LSTM. The number of training
iterations was maintained at 300,000. Similar to the other benchmarks, positional encoding improved
the LSTM’s capacity to manage the larger vocabularies.
6.2
Robustness to Variations in Input Length
So far, all the tasks were experimented using fixed-length inputs (L = 64). One might wonder if
positional encoding is exceptionally effective under this setting, informing RNNs with the exact
timing when each input token should be returned as the output. Thus, it remains unclear whether
or not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is
variable and, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional
encoding attached to the inputs.
6
To assess the robustness to variations in the input length, an additional experiment was conducted on
the LSTM, with the input length varied between 32 and 64. In this setup, the maximum input length
(= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence plus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32).
Consequently, the positional encoding per se cannot even distinguish the input vs. output phases at t
= 33, ..., 64. The vocabulary size was set to 16,384.
As a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM’s performance on the reverse-ordering
task against the perturbations in the input length. This result suggests that the effectiveness of the
positional encoding for RNNs is not limited to strictly scheduled tasks.
6.3
Effects of Additional Parameters in Position-Encoded RNNs
The concatenation of positional encoding with input embeddings inflates the number of learnable
parameters in the input-to-hidden projection weights. This additional parameterization per se does
not influence the learning of the input embeddings, and therefore does not elucidate the enhanced
performance of position-encoded RNNs. This section substantiates this argument by equalizing the
number of learnable parameters between the vanilla and position-encoded models.
Specifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input
embeddings and feeding them to the LSTM. This configuration—henceforth termed ""double
vanilla""—effectively doubled the size of the input- to-hidden weight for each gate in the LSTM,
aligning it with that of the position-encoded LSTM, while maintaining all other parameters, including
the dimensionality of the (non-repeated) input embeddings.
As illustrated, the double vanilla LSTM did not yield any improvements in the reverse-ordering or
sort- ing tasks. These results affirm that the reported enhancement of RNNs is not merely attributable
to the additional parameterization associated with the positional encoding.
6.4
Alternative Implementations of Positional Encoding
While this study implemented positional encoding by sinusoidal waves, there are alternative imple-
mentations proposed in the previous studies. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode
each token position by a learnable embedding. Moreover, the original study of Transformer pointed
out that even random vectors can function as positional encoding.
Accordingly, these two alternative forms of positional encoding were tested on the LSTM performing
the reverse- ordering task. The random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently
sampled from the (512 1)- dimensional hypersphere. The learnable embeddings were implemented
using the canonical embedding module of PyTorch (torch.nn.Embedding). The input length and
vocabulary size were set to 64 and 16,384 respectively. Both the random vectors and learnable
embeddings improved the performance of LSTM.
Among the different implementations of positional encoding, the sinusoidal encoding outperformed
the two alterna- tives. The advantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input
length was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal encoding was more robust to the variations in
the input length than the others.
6.5
Language Modeling
This section reports benchmark results for the language modeling task. Single-layer LSTMs with
and without sinusoidal positional encoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset.
Due to constraints in computational resources, the vocabulary was reduced from the original size of
267,735 to 32,768 by retokenizing the raw data using SentencePiece. The headings were removed,
and the main text was segmented by paragraphs (separated by the line break). Additionally, only the
first 1024 tokens of each paragraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute
positional encoding always aligned with the beginning of each paragraph. The hyperparameters were
configured as specified in §3.3.
As illustrated, positional encoding proved effective only for marginally faster learning during the
initial phase of training. The difference diminished around 10,000/30,000 iterations, and the test
perplexities of the position-encoded model were inferior to those of the vanilla model.

Introduction
The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement
learning (RL) agents [1, 2], where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time.
This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL
agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or
hyperparameter tuning [3, 4], which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Our
work introduces a novel intervention, termed ""plasticity injection,"" designed to directly tackle the
root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared
to existing methods, addressing the limitations of previous strategies that often involve extensive
hyperparameter searches or complex architectural changes. The core innovation lies in its ability
to proactively diagnose and mitigate plasticity loss without significantly increasing computational
demands.
Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for
identifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability
allows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant, preventing
catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The
diagnostic framework leverages novel metrics that capture subtle changes in network behavior,
providing early warning signals of impending plasticity loss. This proactive approach contrasts with
reactive methods that only address plasticity loss after significant performance decline has already
occurred.
Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of
trainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the
computational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This
is achieved through a carefully designed mechanism that selectively modifies the network’s internal
dynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of disrupting
the agent’s learned behavior while effectively addressing the underlying causes of plasticity loss.
The preservation of prediction capabilities is crucial for maintaining the agent’s performance in its
operational environment.
Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved
computational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary
resource consumption during periods of stable performance. The dynamic expansion mechanism is
triggered by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when needed to
.
address emerging plasticity loss. This adaptive approach contrasts with static methods that allocate
fixed resources regardless of the agent’s learning dynamics, leading to potential inefficiencies. The
dynamic nature of plasticity injection contributes to its overall efficiency and scalability.
The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,
including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate a
consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. The modular design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL
algorithms and architectures, enhancing its applicability and impact on the field. Further research
will explore its integration with other advanced RL techniques and its application to more complex
real-world scenarios.

Related Work
The problem of plasticity loss, or catastrophic forgetting, in neural networks has been extensively
studied across various machine learning domains [1, 2]. In the context of deep reinforcement learning
(RL), this phenomenon manifests as a decline in an agent’s ability to learn new tasks or adapt
to changing environments after it has already acquired a certain level of proficiency. Traditional
approaches to mitigate this issue often involve architectural modifications, such as employing separate
networks for different tasks [3], or utilizing techniques like regularization and replay buffers [4, 5] to
preserve previously learned knowledge. However, these methods can be computationally expensive,
particularly for large-scale RL agents, and may not always effectively prevent plasticity loss in
complex scenarios. Furthermore, many existing methods focus on reactive solutions, addressing
plasticity loss only after it has already occurred, rather than proactively preventing it. Our work differs
significantly by introducing a proactive diagnostic framework coupled with a targeted intervention
that minimizes computational overhead.
Several studies have explored the use of dynamic network architectures to improve the efficiency and
adaptability of RL agents [6, 7]. These approaches often involve mechanisms for adding or removing
neurons or layers based on the agent’s performance or the complexity of the environment. However,
these methods typically focus on optimizing the network’s overall structure rather than directly
addressing the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss. In contrast, our plasticity injection method
selectively modifies the network’s internal dynamics without altering its overall architecture, allowing
for a more targeted and efficient approach to mitigating plasticity loss. This targeted approach avoids
the potential disruption of learned policies that can occur with more drastic architectural changes.
The dynamic capacity expansion in our method is also triggered by a diagnostic framework, ensuring
that resources are allocated only when necessary, unlike many existing dynamic architecture methods
that may allocate resources inefficiently.
Another line of research focuses on improving the stability and robustness of RL training through
techniques such as curriculum learning [8] and meta-learning [9]. Curriculum learning gradually
introduces increasingly complex tasks to the agent, allowing it to build a robust foundation of
knowledge before tackling more challenging problems. Meta-learning aims to train agents that
can quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data. While these methods can indirectly
contribute to mitigating plasticity loss by improving the agent’s overall learning stability, they do not
directly address the specific mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Our approach complements
these methods by providing a targeted intervention that directly tackles the root causes of plasticity
loss, enhancing the effectiveness of existing training strategies. The diagnostic component of our
framework also offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, which can
inform the development of even more effective training strategies.
The concept of ""plasticity"" itself has been extensively studied in neuroscience [10, 11], where it refers
to the brain’s ability to adapt and reorganize its structure and function in response to experience.
Our work draws inspiration from these neuroscientific findings, aiming to emulate the brain’s ability
to dynamically adjust its internal mechanisms to maintain learning capacity over time. However,
unlike biological systems, our approach focuses on developing computationally efficient and scalable
methods for achieving this dynamic adaptation in artificial neural networks. The modular design
of our plasticity injection framework allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and
architectures, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the robustness and longevity of RL agents
across a wide range of applications. Future research will explore the integration of plasticity injection
2
with other advanced RL techniques, such as hierarchical RL and multi-agent RL, to further expand
its applicability and impact.

Methodology
The core of our approach, termed ""plasticity injection,"" revolves around three interconnected compo-
nents: a diagnostic framework, a mitigation strategy, and a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism.
These components work in concert to proactively identify, address, and adapt to the onset of plasticity
loss in RL agents. The diagnostic framework continuously monitors key network metrics during
training, providing early warning signals of potential plasticity loss. These metrics are carefully
selected to capture subtle changes in network behavior that might precede significant performance
degradation. We employ a combination of established metrics, such as learning rate decay and loss
function fluctuations, alongside novel metrics specifically designed to detect subtle shifts in the
network’s internal representations. These novel metrics are based on analyzing the distribution of
activations within different layers of the network, providing a more granular understanding of the
network’s internal dynamics. The choice of metrics is informed by our preliminary experiments and
theoretical analysis of plasticity loss mechanisms. The diagnostic framework outputs a plasticity
score, a continuous value reflecting the severity of detected plasticity loss. This score serves as a
trigger for the mitigation and capacity allocation mechanisms.
Our mitigation strategy focuses on selectively modifying the network’s internal dynamics rather than
its overall architecture. This targeted approach avoids the computational overhead and potential
disruption of learned policies associated with architectural modifications. The strategy involves a
carefully designed set of operations applied to the network’s weight matrices and biases. These
operations are guided by the plasticity score, with stronger interventions applied when the score
indicates a higher level of plasticity loss. The specific operations are chosen to enhance the network’s
ability to learn new information without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. We explore
several different operation types, including weight normalization, regularization techniques, and
targeted pruning of less relevant connections. The optimal set of operations and their parameters are
determined through a hyperparameter search conducted on a subset of our benchmark tasks. The
effectiveness of the mitigation strategy is evaluated by comparing the long-term performance of
agents with and without plasticity injection.
The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism complements the mitigation strategy by adaptively
expanding the network’s capacity only when necessary. This mechanism is triggered by the plasticity
score, with the degree of capacity expansion directly proportional to the severity of detected plasticity
loss. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, with
the specific architecture of the added components determined based on the nature of the detected
plasticity loss. For instance, if the diagnostic framework identifies a loss of capacity in a specific
layer, new neurons are added to that layer. This targeted approach ensures that resources are allocated
efficiently, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead during periods of stable performance. The
added capacity is integrated seamlessly into the existing network architecture, minimizing disruption
to the learned policy. The effectiveness of the dynamic capacity allocation is evaluated by comparing
the computational efficiency and long-term performance of agents with and without this mechanism.
The entire plasticity injection framework is implemented as a modular component that can be easily
integrated with various RL algorithms and architectures. This modularity allows for flexibility and
adaptability to different RL tasks and environments. The framework is designed to be computationally
efficient, minimizing the overhead associated with diagnosis, mitigation, and capacity allocation. The
computational efficiency is achieved through careful optimization of the algorithms and data structures
used in each component. The framework’s performance is evaluated across a range of challenging RL
benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. The results
demonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.
Our experimental setup involves a rigorous evaluation across diverse RL environments, encompassing
both continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We
compare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art
baselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The
evaluation metrics include long-term performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency.

framework and to identify potential areas for future improvement. The detailed experimental results
and analysis are presented in the Results section.

Experiments
Our experimental evaluation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating
plasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of challenging RL environments, encompassing both continuous control tasks
and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). These environments represent a
range of complexities, requiring agents to adapt to varying degrees of uncertainty and dynamic
changes. The selection of these environments ensures a robust evaluation of the generalizability
and robustness of our proposed method. We compare the performance of RL agents employing
plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those utilizing established
techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, such as experience replay and regularization
methods. The baselines are carefully selected to represent a range of existing approaches, allowing for
a comprehensive comparison. The experimental setup is designed to isolate the effects of plasticity
injection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements can be directly attributed to our
proposed method. We meticulously control for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter settings
and training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results.
The evaluation metrics employed in our experiments include long-term performance, learning stability,
and computational efficiency. Long-term performance is measured by the average cumulative reward
obtained by the agent over an extended training period. Learning stability is assessed by analyzing
the variance in the agent’s performance over time, with lower variance indicating greater stability.
Computational efficiency is evaluated by measuring the training time and resource consumption
of the agents. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the overall effectiveness of
plasticity injection. We utilize statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to determine the statistical
significance of the observed performance differences between the agents with and without plasticity
injection. The significance level is set at α = 0.05 for all statistical tests. The detailed results of these
statistical analyses are presented in the following subsections.
To further analyze the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we
conduct ablation studies. These studies involve systematically removing individual components of
the framework and evaluating the resulting performance. By comparing the performance of the full
framework to the performance of the framework with individual components removed, we can isolate
the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvement. This allows us to gain a
deeper understanding of the interplay between the diagnostic framework, the mitigation strategy, and
the dynamic capacity allocation mechanism. The results of these ablation studies provide valuable
insights into the design and optimization of the plasticity injection framework. The findings from
these studies inform future improvements and refinements to the framework.

Results
Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating plas-
ticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance and learning stability of reinforcement learning
(RL) agents. We conducted experiments across a diverse set of challenging RL environments, includ-
ing continuous control tasks (e.g., MuJoCo tasks such as HalfCheetah, Ant, Hopper) and partially
observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) (e.g., variations of the gridworld environment
with hidden states). These environments were chosen to represent a range of complexities and to
rigorously test the generalizability of our approach. We compared the performance of RL agents
utilizing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art baselines, including those employing
experience replay [4, 5] and regularization techniques [3]. The baselines were carefully selected
to represent a range of existing approaches for addressing catastrophic forgetting, allowing for a
comprehensive comparison. Our experimental setup was designed to isolate the effects of plasticity
injection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements could be directly attributed to our
proposed method. We meticulously controlled for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter
settings and training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results. All experiments
were run with three different random seeds for each environment and baseline, and the results were
averaged.
The evaluation metrics included long-term performance (average cumulative reward over 1000
episodes), learning stability (measured by the standard deviation of cumulative reward over the
last 200 episodes), and computational efficiency (training time and memory usage). Long-term
performance was chosen to directly assess the ability of the method to prevent plasticity loss over
extended training. Learning stability was included to quantify the consistency of performance over
time. Computational efficiency was evaluated to demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach.
We employed statistical tests, specifically paired t-tests, to determine the statistical significance of
the observed performance differences between agents with and without plasticity injection. The
significance level was set at α = 0.05 for all statistical tests.

Table 1 presents a summary of our experimental results. The results consistently demonstrate
a statistically significant improvement in average cumulative reward when plasticity injection is
employed across all environments (p<0.05 for all environments). Furthermore, the standard deviation
of the cumulative reward was significantly lower for agents using plasticity injection, indicating
improved learning stability. These findings strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method
in mitigating plasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. Detailed results,
including individual episode rewards and learning curves, are provided in the supplementary material.
To further analyze the contribution of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we
conducted ablation studies. These studies involved systematically removing individual components
(diagnostic framework, mitigation strategy, dynamic capacity allocation) and evaluating the resulting
performance. The results (detailed in the supplementary material) showed that all three components
contributed significantly to the overall performance improvement. Removing any single component
resulted in a substantial decrease in both average cumulative reward and learning stability, highlighting
5
the synergistic interaction between the components. The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism
proved particularly crucial in maintaining computational efficiency while preventing performance
degradation in complex environments. The diagnostic framework effectively identified the onset
of plasticity loss, allowing for timely intervention by the mitigation strategy. This combination
of proactive diagnosis and targeted mitigation proved highly effective in preventing catastrophic
forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The modular
design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and architectures,
enhancing its applicability and impact on the field.

Shifts Challenge
Abstract
This paper details the solution developed for the 2021 Shifts Challenge, which
focused on robustness and uncertainty in real-world distributional shifts. The
competition sought methods for addressing motion prediction in cross-domain
scenarios. A key issue is the variance between input and ground truth data distribu-
tions, known as the domain shift problem. The method proposed features a novel
architecture utilizing a self-attention mechanism and a specifically designed loss
function. Ultimately, this approach achieved 3rd place in the competition.
1
Introduction
This paper examines the crucial issue of prediction in autonomous driving. Predicting vehicle
trajectories to generate control commands is essential for avoiding collisions. While deep learning
has shown promise in specific domains, real-world conditions, such as varying environments, weather,
and driver behaviors, create challenges for models trained on single datasets. These models may not
perform well across diverse datasets.
The 2021 Shifts Challenge concentrated on prediction tasks across different domains. The goal was
to predict 25 timestamps of trajectories from given raster images. To address this, a new architecture
was developed using insights from current research. The feature extractor was modified using NFNet
for stability, and a self-attention layer was included to enhance time-related predictions. The loss
function was also adjusted for improved robustness, leading to a 3rd place ranking with 8.637 R-AUC
CNLL in the competition.
2
Our Solution
This section explains the solution for the domain-shift problem through the design of new model
architectures. The domain-shift problem arises when training and validation datasets come from
different distributions. Given input raster images X that contain the first 5 seconds of vehicle data, the
objective is to predict the last 5 seconds of trajectories Y for the objects. These images include details
about the positions, orientations, accelerations, and velocities of dynamic objects. The proposed
model has two main parts: (1) a new backbone model and feature extractor, and (2) a revised loss
function for better performance.
[width=0.8]./Recurrentmodel.png
Figure 1: Base Model Architecture: The baseline model uses the backbone model to extract features
and utilizes recurrent model to generate prediction according to latent vectors.
2.1
Baseline Model
The competition provided two baseline models and used an ensemble method to improve robustness.
Both Behavior Cloning (BC) and Deep Imitation Model (DIM) use convolutional backbones to
.
convert raster image data into a latent vector, and then apply an autoregressive model to predict
vehicle paths based on the latent vector. BC models the autoregressive likelihood as a single-variate
Gaussian, while DIM uses a multivariate normal distribution. After assessing the performance of BC
and DIM, BC was selected as the baseline due to its better performance. The BC method is broken
down into two components: the feature extraction backbone and the recurrent model.
Feature Extraction Backbone Using the input raster image X, a feature extraction backbone and a
self-attention layer (described below) are used to encode both spatial and temporal information about
dynamic objects into a latent embedding.
Z = f(X)
(1)
The baseline applies MobileNetV1 as its backbone. MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 were also
considered but produced worse results, likely due to the simplicity of input data and model complexity.
Ultimately, the NFNet was chosen as the backbone (feature extractor) because of its training stability.
Self-Attention Layer To further refine the raster image features, a self-attention layer was in-
corporated. Self-attention, a key part of the Transformer model, allows for the consideration of
long-range dependencies and global information. The feature map was divided into pixel groups, and
self-attention was used to aggregate pixel-wise information.
Recurrent Model The GRU model was selected for the recurrent component due to superior
performance compared to other models. Using the embedding from feature extraction as hidden
states, the recurrent model makes predictions recursively. Given the embedding Zt at time t, with the
output vector Y0 as zero vector, the recurrent model g is used to generate predictions:
Zt = gencoder(Yt−1, Zt−1)
(2)
Yt = gdecoder(Yt−1, Zt)
(3)
Where Yt ∈RB×T ×2 represents the vehicle’s position on a 2D bird’s-eye-view map, and Zt ∈RB×K
represents the hidden vector. B and T refer to the batch and time dimensions, respectively.
2.2
Loss Function
The model was initially trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss. However, because of the
inadequate performance of the model on Average Distance Error (ADE) and Final Distance Error
(FDE), these metrics were added to minimize the distance between predicted and actual positions.
NLL(Y ) = −log(p(Y ))
(4)
Loss = −log(p(Y ; θ)) + γ1||Y −ˆY || + γ2||Yf −ˆYf||
(5)
Here, p(Y ; θ) indicates the probability of a predicted trajectory Y based on model parameters θ. Yf
represents the trajectory’s final location. In the equation, the first component is the original loss, the
second is the ADE loss, and the last is the FDE loss.

Ensemble Method
To improve performance, the Robust Imitative Planning (RIP) method was employed to combine
several models.

Distance Error (FDE), and Negative log-likelihood (NLL). ADE measures the sum of squared errors
between predicted and actual positions at each time step. FDE calculates the sum of squared errors of
the final positions. NLL measures the unlikelihood of predicted trajectories matching the actual ones.

Implementation Details
Models were trained on a single V100 machine for one day, with a batch size of 512 and a learning

clipping with a value of 1.0 was used.

Ablation Study and Comparison Results
Ablation Study Table 1 displays the results of the ablation study. The baselines selected were
DIM and BC. Various backbones, including EfficientNet, NFNet, and MobileNet, were compared,
but models with more parameters performed worse. This result suggests that simpler models are
sufficient for extracting raster image information. Adding a self-attention mechanism improved the
results. Finally, incorporating ADE and FDE loss further improved performance, as shown in Table
1. Although the DIM method resulted in the lowest Negative Log Likelihood(NLL), it was not as
competitive as other models. Therefore, the DIM model was not chosen to pursue performance.

P005.pdf,"Collaborative Clothing Segmentation and
Identification Through Image Analysis
Abstract
This research introduces a comprehensive clothing co-parsing system designed
to analyze a collection of clothing images, which are unsegmented but include
descriptive tags. The system aims to segment these images into meaningful config-
urations. The proposed method uses a two-stage, data-driven approach. The first
stage, termed ""image co-segmentation,"" iteratively refines image regions, using
the exemplar-SVM (E-SVM) method to enhance region consistency across images.
The second stage, ""region co-labeling,"" utilizes a multi-image graphical model
where segmented regions serve as nodes. This incorporates contextual information
about clothing, such as item placement and interactions, which can be solved using
the efficient Graph Cuts algorithm. The system’s performance is tested on the
Fashionista dataset and a newly developed dataset called CCP, which contains 2098
high-resolution street fashion images. The results show a segmentation accuracy of
90.29% and 88.23% and a recognition rate of 65.52% and 63.89% on the Fashion-
ista and CCP datasets, respectively, demonstrating an improvement over current
leading methods.

Introduction
The growth of online clothing sales has increased the demand for accurate clothing recognition and
retrieval technologies. This has led to the development of several vision-based solutions. A key
challenge in these systems is the detailed, pixel-level labeling of clothing, which is often resource-
intensive. However, image-level tags from user data offer a viable alternative. This paper focuses
on the development of a system to segment clothing images and assign semantic labels to these
segments.
The main contribution of this work is an effective system for parsing groups of clothing images and
providing precise pixel-level annotations. The system addresses the following significant challenges:
• Clothes exhibit a wide variety of styles and textures, making them difficult to segment and
identify using only basic visual features.
• Variations in human poses and the way clothes can obscure themselves complicate the
recognition process.
• The existence of numerous, highly specific clothing categories, such as over 50 in the
Fashionista dataset, far more than in existing co-segmentation systems which typically
handle fewer categories.
To overcome these challenges, the system employs two sequential stages: image co-segmentation
to isolate distinct clothing regions and region co-labeling to identify different clothing items, as
illustrated below. It also utilizes contextual cues related to how clothing items are typically arranged
and related to each other.
The co-segmentation phase refines regions across images using the E-SVM method. Initially, images
are divided into superpixels, which are then grouped into regions. Many of these regions may not be
.
meaningful due to the diversity of clothing and human poses. However, certain stable regions are
identified based on criteria like size and position. E-SVM classifiers are trained for these selected
regions using HOG features, creating region-based detectors that help identify similar regions across
images. This approach is based on the observation that similar clothing items often share visual
patterns.
The co-labeling phase uses a data-driven approach, constructing a multi-image graph where regions
are treated as nodes. Connections are made between adjacent regions within an image, as well as
between regions in different images that share visual or tag similarities. This strategy allows for
collective label assignment, leveraging similarities across images. The optimization is performed
using the Graph Cuts algorithm, considering various clothing context constraints.

Related Work
Previous research on clothing and human segmentation has often focused on creating detailed models
to handle the diversity in clothing styles and appearances. Some of the classic work used And-Or
graph templates to model and parse clothing configurations. Subsequent studies explored blocking
models for segmenting clothes in images where items were heavily obscured, and deformable spatial
models to enhance segmentation accuracy. Recent approaches have used shape-based human models
or combined pose estimation with supervised region labeling, achieving notable results. However,
these methods have not been applied to clothing co-parsing and typically demand significant labeling
effort.
Research on image/object co-labeling, which jointly processes a set of images containing similar
objects, has been explored. Methods include unsupervised shape-guided approaches for single-
category co-labeling and incorporating automatic image segmentation with spatially coherent latent
topic models for unsupervised multi-class labeling. These unsupervised methods can struggle with a
large number of categories and diverse appearances. Recent efforts have focused on supervised label
propagation, using pixel-level label maps to assign labels to new images. However, these methods are
often limited by the need for detailed annotations and rely on pixel-level correspondences, which
may not be effective for clothing parsing.
3
Methodology
This research introduces a probabilistic model for the co-parsing of clothing images. The input
consists of a set of clothing images, denoted as I = {Ii}N
i=1, each associated with tags Ti. Each
image Ii is represented by a set of superpixels, Ii = {sj}M
j=1, which are subsequently grouped into
coherent regions. Each image is associated with four additional variables:
(a) Regions {rk}K
k=1, each comprising a set of superpixels.
(b) Garment labels for each region, denoted as ℓk ∈T, where k = 1, . . . , K.
(c) E-SVM weights wk trained for each selected region.
(d) Segmentation propagations C = (x, y, m), where (x, y) is the location and m is the
segmentation mask of an E-SVM, indicating that mask m can be propagated to position
(x, y) of Ii.
The objective is to optimize parameters by maximizing the posterior probability:
{L∗, R∗, W ∗, C∗} = arg max P(L, R, W, C|I)
This probability can be factorized into co-labeling and co-segmentation components:
P(L, R, W, C|I) ∝P(L|R, C) ×
N
Y
i=1
P(Ri|Ci, Ii)P(Wi|Ri)P(Ci|Wi, Ii)
The optimization process involves two phases: clothing image co-segmentation and co-labeling.
2
In the co-segmentation phase, optimal regions are obtained by maximizing P(R|C, I). A superpixel
grouping indicator oj ∈{1, . . . , K} is introduced, indicating the region to which superpixel sj
belongs. Each region rk is defined as rk = {sj|oj = k}. The probability P(R|C, I) is defined as:
P(R|C, I) =
Y


P(ri|C, I)
Y
sj∈Ii
P(oj|C, Ii)
Y
(m,n)
P(om, on, sm, sn|C)


The unary potential P(oj, sj) indicates the probability of superpixel sj belonging to a region, and the
pairwise potential P(om, on, sm, sn|C) encourages smoothness between neighboring superpixels.
Coherent regions are selected to train E-SVMs by maximizing P(W|R):
P(W|R) =
Y
k
P(wk|rk) ∝
Y
k
exp{−E(wk, rk) −ϕ(rk)}
where ϕ(rj) indicates whether rj has been chosen for training E-SVM, and E(wk, rk) is the convex
energy function of E-SVM.
Finally, P(Ci|Wi, Ii) is defined based on the responses of E-SVM classifiers, maximized by selecting
the top k detections of each E-SVM as segmentation propagations.
In the co-labeling phase, a multi-image graphical model is used to assign a garment tag to each
region:
P(L|R, C) ∝
N

where P(ℓik, ri) is the singleton potential, P(ℓim, ℓin, ri, rj) is the interior affinity model, and
Q(ℓiu, ℓiv, ru, rv|C) is the exterior affinity model.

Unsupervised Image Co-Segmentation
The co-segmentation process involves iteratively refining regions, E-SVM weights, and segmentation
propagations.
Superpixel Grouping: A linear programming problem is formulated to determine the number of
regions automatically:

where d(se1, se2) is the dissimilarity between superpixels and h(c) measures the consistency of

E(wk, rk) = λ1

Segmentation Propagation: The E-SVM response is calibrated using a logistic distribution:
SE(f; w) =
1
1 + exp(−αE(wT f −βE))
3.2
Contextualized Co-Labeling
In this phase, a multi-image graphical model connects all images, incorporating two types of clothing
contexts. The singleton potential is defined as:
P(ℓk, rk) = sig(S(f(rk), ℓk)) · Gℓk(Xk)
where S(f(rk), ℓk) is the appearance model score and Gℓk(Xk) is the location context.
The interior affinity model is:
P(ℓim, ℓin, rm, rn) = ϕ(ℓim, ℓin, rm, rn) · U(ℓim, ℓin)
and the exterior affinity model is:
Q(ℓiu, ℓiv, ru, rv|C) = Gℓiu(Xu) · Gℓiv(Xv) · ϕ(ℓiu, ℓiv, ru, rv)

tags. The framework includes a new dataset of high-resolution street fashion photos with detailed

P088.pdf,"Analyzing Groups of Neurons in Neural Networks: Comparing
Information from Input and Output Perspectives
Abstract
The concept of a ""modular"" structure in artificial neural networks has been suggested as beneficial for learning,
the ability to combine elements, and applying knowledge to new situations. However, a clear definition and
measurement of modularity are still open questions. This paper reframes the identification of functional modules as
the identification of groups of units with similar functions. This raises the question of what constitutes functional
similarity between two units. To address this, we examine two main categories of methods: those that define
similarity based on how units react to variations in inputs (upstream), and those that define similarity based on
how changes in hidden unit activations affect outputs (downstream). We perform an empirical analysis to measure
the modularity of hidden layer representations in simple feedforward, fully connected networks across various
settings. For each model, we assess the relationships between pairs of hidden units in each layer using a range
of upstream and downstream metrics, then group them by maximizing their ""modularity score"" with established
network science tools. We find two unexpected results: first, dropout significantly increased modularity, while
other forms of weight regularization had smaller effects. Second, while we observe general agreement on clusters
within upstream methods and within downstream methods, there is limited agreement on cluster assignments
between these two categories. This has significant implications for representation learning, as it implies that
finding modular representations that reflect input structure (e.g., disentanglement) may be a different objective
from learning modular representations that reflect output structure (e.g., compositionality).

Introduction
Modularity, a principle where complex systems are broken down into simpler subsystems, allows for independent analysis, debugging,
and recombination for new tasks. This design approach offers benefits like enhanced robustness and quicker adaptation to new
challenges. It is recognized that learning systems gain advantages from structures tailored to the specific problem, and many
real-world problems can indeed be divided into sub-problems. Consequently, modularity is viewed as a standard design principle in
evolved biological systems, including biological neural networks, and one that can be advantageous for artificial neural networks
(ANNs).
Despite the intuitive appeal, formally defining and quantifying the modularity of a given system remains an unresolved issue. It is
generally agreed that modular systems, by definition, break down into subsystems that carry out functions to solve sub-problems.
Defining modules in ANNs, therefore, requires us to determine when two parts of a network are involved in the same ""function"". In
this paper, we address this question at the level of pairs of hidden units. We explore various methods for assessing the ""functional
similarity"" of any two hidden units, and we define a ""module"" as a group of units with similar functions. This definition is not
intended to be the definitive answer to what constitutes a module, but rather to offer a practical foundation for experimenting with
different concepts related to modularity, such as how regularization affects it.
A key objective of this paper is to highlight the differences between ""upstream"" and ""downstream"" perspectives when considering
neural representations and their functions. In Section 3, we provide precise definitions and detail our method for identifying and
quantifying functional modules in the hidden layers of trained neural networks by grouping units into functionally similar sets. This
framework enables us to directly compare various indicators of a network’s modularity. Section 4 describes the experimental results.
Besides quantitatively evaluating modularity, we further examine whether different similarity measures agree on the assignment of
units to modules. Surprisingly, we find that modules identified using ""upstream"" measures of functional similarity are consistently
different from those found using ""downstream"" measures. Although we do not examine regularization methods specifically designed
to create modular designs, these initial findings call for a more in-depth examination of how the ""function"" of a representation is
defined, as well as why and when modules might be beneficial.

Related Work
The investigation of modularity in neural networks has a rich history. A frequent source of inspiration from biology is the separation
of ""what"" and ""where"" pathways in the ventral and dorsal streams of the brain, respectively. Each pathway can be viewed as a
specialized module (and can be further divided into submodules). Numerous prior experiments on modularity in artificial neural
networks have investigated principles that would lead to similarly distinct what/where information processing in ANNs. A significant
distinction from this line of work is that, instead of predefining the functional role of modules, such as one module handling ""what""
and another handling ""where,"" our research aims to discover distinct functional groups in trained networks.
Generally, there are two categories of approaches to modularity in neural networks, each corresponding to a different way of
understanding the function of network components. The structural modularity approach defines function based on network weights
and the connections between sub-networks. Modules are thus defined as sub-networks with dense internal connections and sparse
external connections. The functional modularity approach focuses on network activations or the information represented by those
activations, rather than weights. This includes concepts like disentanglement, compositionality, and invariance. The connection
between structural and functional modules is not entirely clear. While they seem to be (or should be) correlated, it has been observed
that even very sparse inter-module connectivity does not always ensure functional separation of information processing. In this study,
we adopt the functional approach, assuming that structural modularity is only useful to the extent that it supports distinct functions
of the units, and that often distinct functions must share information, making strict structural boundaries potentially detrimental. For
instance, in a complex visual scene, knowing ""what"" an object is can aid in determining ""where"" it is, and vice versa.
Our work is most closely related to a series of papers by Watanabe and colleagues in which trained networks are decomposed into
clusters of ""similar"" units with the aim of understanding and simplifying those networks. They quantify the similarity of units using
a combination of both incoming and outgoing weights. This is similar in spirit to our goal of identifying modules by clustering units,
but an interesting contrast to our approach, where we find stark differences between ""upstream"" and ""downstream"" similarity.
3
Quantifying modularity by clustering similarity
We divide the task of identifying functional modules into two phases: evaluating the pairwise similarity of units, and then clustering
based on this similarity. For simplicity, we apply these steps separately to each hidden layer, although in principle, modules could be
assessed in the same way after combining layers. Section 3.1 defines the set of pairwise functional similarity methods we use, and
Section 3.2 describes the clustering phase.
While we concentrate on similarity between pairs of individual units, our method is connected to, and inspired by, the question of
what makes neural representations ""similar"" when comparing entire populations of neurons to each other. Instead of finding clusters
of similar neurons as we do here, one could define modules in terms of dissimilarity between clusters of neurons. In preliminary
work, we explored such a definition of functional modules, using representational (dis)similarity between sub-populations of neurons.
The primary challenge with this approach is that existing representational similarity methods are highly sensitive to dimensionality
(the number of neurons in each cluster), and it is not clear how best to account for this when calculating dissimilarity between clusters
so that the method is not biased towards larger or smaller cluster sizes. To further justify our method, note that representational
similarity analysis is closely related to tests for statistical (in)dependence between populations of neurons, and so the problem of
finding mutually ""dissimilar"" modules is analogous to the problem of finding independent subspaces. In Independent Subspace
Analysis (ISA), there is a similar issue of determining what constitutes a surprising amount of dependence between subspaces of
different dimensions, and various methods have been proposed with different inductive biases. However, Palmer Makeig showed
that a solution to the problem of detecting independent subspaces is to simply cluster the individual dimensions of the space. This
provides some justification for the methods we use here: some technicalities notwithstanding, the problem of finding subspaces of
neural activity with ""dissimilar"" representations is, in many cases, reducible to the problem of clustering individual units based on
pairwise similarity, as we do here.
3.1
Quantifying pairwise similarity of hidden units
What constitutes ""functional similarity"" between two hidden units? In other words, we are looking for a similarity function S that
takes a neural network N, a dataset D, and a task T as inputs, and produces an n x n matrix of non-negative similarity scores for all
pairs among the n hidden units. We also require that the resulting matrix is symmetric, meaning Sij = Sji. Importantly, allowing S to
depend on the task T opens up the possibility of similarity measures where units are considered similar based on their downstream
contribution to a specific loss function.
Similarity by covariance. The first similarity measure we examine is the absolute value of the covariance of hidden unit activities
across inputs. Let xk be the kth input in the dataset, and hi(x) be the response of the ith hidden unit to input x, with i in 1, 2, ..., n.
Then, we define similarity as
Scov
ij
= 1
K
K
X
k=1
|(hi(xk) −¯hi)(hj(xk) −¯hj)|
(1)
2
where K is the number of items in D and ¯hi is the mean response of unit i on the given dataset. Intuitively, the absolute value
covariance quantifies the statistical dependence of two units across inputs, making it an upstream measure of similarity.
Similarity by input sensitivity. While Scov measures similarity of responses across inputs, we next consider a measure of similar
sensitivity to single inputs, which is then averaged over D. Let Jh
xk denote the n x d Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of each
hidden unit with respect to each of the d input dimensions. Then, we say two units i and j are similarly sensitive to input changes on
input xk if the dot product between the ith and jth row of Jh
xk has high absolute-value magnitude. In matrix notation over the entire
dataset, we use
Si−sens
ij
= 1
K
K
X
k=1
|Jh
xk(Jh
xk)T |
(2)
where the superscript ""i-sens"" should be read as the ""input sensitivity.""
Similarity by last-layer sensitivity. Let y denote the last-layer activity of the network. Using the same Jacobian notation as above, let
Jy
h denote the o x n matrix of partial derivatives of the last layer with respect to changes in the hidden activities h. Then, we define
similarity by output sensitivity as
So−sens
ij
= 1
K
K
X
k=1
|Jy
h(Jy
h)T |
(3)
likewise with ""o-sens"" to be read as ""output-sensitivity."" Note that both h and y depend on the particular input xk, but this has been
left implicit in the notation to reduce clutter.
Similarity by the loss Hessian. The ""function"" of a hidden unit might usefully be thought of in terms of its contribution to the task or
tasks it was trained on. To quote Lipson, ""In order to measure modularity, one must have a quantitative definition of function... It is
then possible to take an arbitrary chunk of a system and measure the dependency of the system function on elements within that
chunk. The more that the dependency itself depends on elements outside the chunk, the less the function of that chunk is localized,
and hence the less modular it is.""
Lipson then goes on to suggest that the ""dependence of system function on elements"" can be expressed as a derivative or gradient,
and that the dependence of that dependence on other parts of the system can be expressed as the second derivative or Hessian.
Towards this conception of modular functions on a particular task, we use the following definition of similarity:
Shess
ij
= 1
K
K
X
k=1
|
∂2L
∂hi∂hj
|
(4)
where L is the scalar loss function for the task, and should be understood to depend on the particular input xk. Importantly, each
Hessian on the right hand side is taken with respect to the activity of hidden units, not with respect to the network parameters as it is
typically defined.
To summarize, equations (1) through (4) provide four different methods to quantify pairwise similarity of hidden units. Scov and
Si−sens are upstream, while So−sens and Shess are downstream. All four take values in [0, ). However, it is not clear if the raw
magnitudes matter, or only relative (normalized) magnitudes. For these reasons, we introduce an optional normalized version of
each of the above four un-normalized similarity measures:
S′
ij =
Sij
max(Sii, Sjj, ϵ)
(5)
where ˘20ac is a small positive value included for numerical stability. Whereas Sij is in [0, ), the normalized values are restricted
to S′
ij in [0,1]. In total, this gives us eight methods to quantify pairwise similarity. These can be thought of as 2x2x2 product of
methods, as shown in the color scheme in Figure 2: the upstream vs downstream axis, the unnormalized vs normalized axis, and
the covariance vs gradient (i.e. sensitivity) axis. We group together both Scov and Shess under the term ""covariance"" because the
Hessian is closely related to the covariance of gradient vectors of the loss across inputs.
3.2
Quantifying modularity by clustering
Decomposing a set into clusters that are maximally similar within clusters and maximally dissimilar across clusters is a well-studied
problem in graph theory and network science. In particular, Girvan Newman proposed a method that cuts a graph into its maximally
modular subgraphs, and this tool has previously been used to study modular neural networks.
3
We apply this tool from graph theory to our problem of detecting functional modules in neural networks by constructing an adjacency
matrix A from the similarity matrix S by simply removing the diagonal (self-similarity):
Aij =
Sij
if i ̸= j
0
otherwise
(6)
Given A, we can simplify later notation by first constructing the normalized adjacency matrix, ˜A, whose elements all sum to one:
˜Aij =
Aij
P
ij Aij
(7)
or, more compactly, ˜A = A/1T
nA1n where 1n is a column vector of length n containing all ones. Let P be an n x c matrix that
represents cluster assignments for each of n units to a maximum of c different clusters. Cluster assignments can be ""hard"" (Pij in 0,
1) or ""soft"" (Pij in [0, 1]), but in either case the constraint P1c = 1n must be met, i.e. that the sum of cluster assignments for each
unit is 1. If an entire column of P is zero, that cluster is unused, so c only provides an upper-limit to the number of clusters, and in
practice we set c = n. Girvan Newman propose the following score to quantify the level of ""modularity"" when partitioning the
normalized adjacency matrix ˜A into the cluster assignments P:
Q( ˜A, P) = Tr(P T ˜AP) −Tr(P T ˜A1n1T
n ˜AP)
(8)
The first term sums the total connectivity (or, in our case, similarity) of units that share a cluster. By itself, this term is maximized
when P assigns all units to a single cluster. The second term gives the expected connectivity within each cluster under a null
model where the elements of ˜A are interpreted as the joint probability of a connection, and so ˜A1n1T
n ˜A is the product of marginal
probabilities of each unit’s connections. This second term encourages P to place units into the same cluster only if they are
more similar to each other than ""chance."" Together, equation (8) is maximized by partitioning ˜A into clusters that are strongly
intra-connected and weakly inter-connected.
We define the modularity of a set of neural network units as the maximum achievable Q over all P:
P ∗( ˜A) = argmaxP Q( ˜A, P)Q∗( ˜A) = Q( ˜A, P ∗)
(9)
To summarize, to divide a given pairwise similarity matrix S into modules, we first construct ˜A from S, then we find the cluster
assignments P ∗that give the maximal value Q∗. Importantly, this optimization process provides two pieces of information: a
modularity score Q∗which quantifies the amount of modularity in a set of neurons, for a given similarity measure. We also get
the actual cluster assignments P ∗, which provide additional information and can be compared across different similarity measures.
Given a set of cluster assignments P ∗, we quantify the number of clusters by first getting the fraction of units in each cluster,
r(P ∗) = 1T
nP ∗/n. We then use the formula for discrete entropy to measure the dispersion of cluster sizes: H(r) = −Pc
i=1 rilogri.
Finally we say that the number of clusters in P ∗is
numclusters(P ∗) = eH(r(P ∗))
(10)
We emphasize that discovering the number of clusters in P ∗is included automatically in the optimization process; we set the
maximum number of clusters c equal to the number of hidden units n, but in our experiments we find that P ∗rarely uses more than 6
clusters for hidden layers with 64 units (Supplemental Figure S4).
It is important to recognize that the sense of the word ""modularity"" in graph theory is in some important ways distinct from its
meaning in terms of engineering functionally modular systems. In graph-theoretic terms, a ""module"" is a cluster of nodes that are
highly intra-connected and weakly inter-connected to other parts of the network, defined formally by Q. This definition of graph
modularity uses a particular idea of a ""null model"" based on random connectivity between nodes in a graph. While this null-model
of graph connectivity enjoys a good deal of historical precedence in the theory of randomly-connected graphs, where unweighted
graphs are commonly studied in terms of the probability of connection between random pairs of nodes, it is not obvious that the
same sort of null model applies to groups of ""functionally similar"" units in an ANN. This relates to the earlier discussion of ISA, and
provides a possibly unsatisfying answer to the question of what counts as a ""surprising"" amount of statistical independence between
clusters; using Q makes the implicit choice that the product of average pairwise similarity, ˜A1n1T
n ˜A, gives the ""expected"" similarity
between units. An important problem for future work will be to closely reexamine the question of what makes neural populations
functionally similar or dissimilar, above and beyond statistical similarity, and what constitutes a surprising amount of (dis)similarity
that may be indicative of modular design.
Finding P ∗exactly is NP-complete, so in practice we use a variation on the approximate method proposed by Newman. Briefly, the
approximation works in two steps: first, an initial set of cluster assignments is constructed using a fast spectral initialization method
that, similar to other spectral clustering algorithms, recursively divides units into clusters based on the sign of eigenvectors of the
4
matrix B = ˜A −˜A1n1T
n ˜A and its submatrices. Only subdivisions that increase Q are kept. In the second step, we use a Monte Carlo
method that repeatedly selects a random unit i then resamples its cluster assignment, holding the other n-1 assignments fixed. This
resampling step involves a kind of exploration/exploitation trade-off: Q may decrease slightly on each move to potentially find a
better global optimum. We found that it was beneficial to control the entropy of each step using a temperature parameter, to ensure
that a good explore/exploit balance was struck for all ˜A. Supplemental Figure S2 shows that both the initialization and the Monte
Carlo steps play a crucial role in finding P ∗, consistent with the observations of Newman. Full algorithms are given in Appendix
A.1.

Experiments
4.1
Setup and initial hypotheses
Because our primary goal is to understand the behavior of the various notions of modularity above, i.e. based on the eight different
methods for quantifying pairwise similarity introduced in the previous section, we opted to study a large collection of simple networks
trained on MNIST. All pairwise similarity scores were computed using held-out test data. We trained 270 models, comprising 9 runs
of each of 30 regularization settings, summarized in Table 1. We defined x (input layer) as the raw 784-dimensional pixel inputs and
y (output layer) as the 10-dimensional class logits. We used the same basic feedforward architecture for all models, comprising
two layers of hidden activity connected by three layers of fully-connected weights: Linear(784, 64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64,
64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64, 10). We analyzed modularity in the two 64-dimensional hidden layers following the dropout
operations. We discarded 21 models that achieved less than 80
Before running these experiments, we hypothesized that
1. Dropout would decrease modularity by encouraging functions to be ""spread out"" over many units. 2. L2 regularization (weight
decay) would minimally impact modularity since the L2 norm is invariant to rotation while modularity depends on axis-alignment. 3.
L1 regularization on weights would increase modularity by encouraging sparsity between subnetworks. 4. All similarity measures
would be qualitatively consistent with each other.
As shown below, all four of these hypotheses turned out to be wrong, to varying degrees.
4.2
How modularity depends on regularization
Figure 3 shows the dependence of trained networks’ modularity score (Q∗) as a function of regularization strength for each of three
types of regularization: an L2 penalty on the weights (weight decay), an L1 penalty on the weights, and dropout. The top row of
Figure 3 shows four example ˜A matrices sorted by cluster, to help give an intuition behind the quantitative values of Q∗. In these
examples, the increasing value of Q∗is driven by an increasing contrast between intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster similarity.
In this example, it also appears that the number and size of clusters remains roughly constant; this observation is confirmed by
plotting the number of clusters versus regularization strength in Supplemental Figure S4.
Figure 3 shows a number of surprising patterns that contradict our initial predictions. First, and most saliently, we had predicted that
dropout would reduce modularity, but found instead that it has the greatest effect on Q∗among the three regularization methods we
tried. This is especially apparent in the upstream methods (first two columns of the figure), and is also stronger for the first hidden
layer than the second (Supplemental Figure S3). In general, Q∗can increase either if the network partitions into a greater number of
clusters, or if the contrast between clusters is exaggerated. We found that this dramatic effect of dropout on Q∗was accompanied
by only minor changes to the number of clusters (Supplemental Figure S4), and so we can conclude that dropout increases Q∗by
increasing the redundancy of hidden units. In other words, hidden units become more clusterable because they are driven towards
behaving like functional replicas of each other, separately for each cluster. This observation echoes, and may explain, why dropout
also increases the ""clusterability"" of network weights in a separate study.
The second surprising result in Figure 3 is that L2 regularization on the weights did, in fact, increase Q∗, whereas we had expected it
to have no impact. Third, L1 regularization had a surprisingly weak effect, although its similarity to the L2 regularization results
may be explained by the fact that they actually resulted in fairly commensurate sparsity in the trained weights (Supplemental Figure
S1 bottom row). Fourth, we had expected few differences between the eight different methods for computing similarity, but there
appear to be distinctive trends by similarity type both in Figure S3 as well as in the number of clusters detected (Supplemental
Figure S4). The next section explores the question of similarity in the results in more detail.
4.3
Comparing modules discovered by different similarity methods
The previous section discussed idiosyncratic trends in the modularity scores Q∗as a function of both regularization strength and
how pairwise similarity between units (S) is computed. However, such differences in the quantitative value of Q∗are difficult to
interpret, and would largely be moot if the various methods agreed on the question of which units belong in which cluster. We now
turn to the question of how similar the cluster assignments P ∗are across our eight definitions of functional modules. To minimize
ambiguity, we will use the term ""functional-similarity"" to refer to S, and ""cluster-similarity"" to refer to the comparison of different
cluster assignments P ∗.
5
Quantifying similarity between cluster assignments is a well-studied problem, and we tested a variety of methods in the clusim
Python package. All cluster-similarity methods we investigated gave qualitatively similar results, so here we report only the ""Element
Similarity"" method of Gates et al., which is a value between 0 and 1 that is small when two cluster assignments are unrelated, and
large when one cluster assignment is highly predictive of the other. Note that this cluster-similarity analysis is applied only to P ∗
cluster assignments computed in the same layer of the same model. Thus, any dissimilarity in clusters that we see is due entirely to
the different choices for functional-similarity, S.
Figure 4a summarizes the results of this cluster-similarity analysis: there is a striking difference between clusters of units identified by
""upstream"" functional-similarity methods (Scov, ˜Scov, Si−sens, ˜Si−sens) compared to ""downstream"" functional-similarity methods
(Shess, ˜Shess, So−sens, ˜So−sens). This analysis also reveals secondary structure within each class of upstream and downstream
methods, where the choice to normalize not (S vs ˜S) appears to matter little, and where there is a moderate difference between
moment-based methods (Scov, Shess) and gradient-based methods (Si−sens, So−sens). It is worth noting that some of this secondary
structure is not robust across all types and levels of regularization; in particular, increasing L2 or L1 regularization strength appears
to lead to (i) stronger dependence on normalization in the downstream methods, and (ii) a stronger overall agreement among the
upstream methods (Supplemental Figure S5).
We next asked to what extent these cluster-similarity results are driven by training. As shown in Figure 4b, much of the structure
in the downstream methods is unaffected by training (i.e. it is present in untrained models as well), while the cluster-similarity
among different upstream methods only emerged as a result of training. Interestingly, this analysis further shows that the main
upstream-vs-downstream distinction seen in Figure 4a is, in fact, attenuated slightly by training.

Conclusions
The prevalence of ""modular"" designs in both engineered and evolved systems has led many to consider the benefits of modularity as
a design principle, and how learning agents like artificial neural networks might discover such designs. However, precisely defining
what constitutes a ""module"" within a neural network remains an open problem. In this work, we operationalized modules in a neural
network as groups of hidden units that carry out similar functions. This naturally leads to the question of what makes any two units
functionally similar. We introduced eight functional similarity measures designed to capture various intuitions about unit similarity
and empirically evaluated cluster assignments based on each method in a large number of trained models.
One unexpected observation was that dropout increases modularity (as defined by Q∗), although this has little to do with the
common-sense definition of a ""module."" Instead, it is a byproduct of dropout causing subsets of units to behave like near-copies
of each other, perhaps so that if one unit is dropped out, a copy of it provides similar information to the subsequent layer. To our
knowledge, this redundancy-inducing effect of dropout has not been noted in the literature previously.
Our main result is that there is a crucial difference between defining ""function"" in terms of how units are driven by upstream inputs,
and how units drive downstream outputs. While we studied this distinction between upstream and downstream similarity in the
context of modularity and clustering, it speaks to the deeper and more general problem of how best to interpret neural representations.
For example, some sub-disciplines of representation-learning (e.g. ""disentanglement"") have long emphasized that a ""good"" neural
representation is one where distinct features of the world drive distinct sub-populations or sub-spaces of neural activity. This is an
upstream way of thinking about what is represented, since it depends only on the relationship between inputs and the unit activations
and does not take into account what happens downstream. Meanwhile, many have argued that the defining characteristic of a neural
representation is its causal role in downstream behavior; this is, of course, a downstream way of thinking. At a high level, one way
to interpret our results is is that upstream and downstream ways of thinking about neural representations are not necessarily aligned,
even in trained networks. This observation is reminiscent of recent empirical work finding that ""disentangled"" representations in
auto-encoders (an upstream concept) do not necessarily lead to improved performance or generalization to novel tasks (a downstream
concept).
Despite its theoretical motivations, this is an empirical study. We trained over 250 feedforward, fully-connected neural networks on
MNIST. While it is not obvious whether MNIST admits a meaningful ""modular"" solution, we expect that the main results we show
here are likely robust, in particular (i) the effect of weight decay, an L1 weight penalty, and dropout, and (ii) misalignment between
upstream and downstream definitions of neural similarity.
Our work raises the important questions: are neural representations defined by their inputs or their outputs? And, in what contexts
is it beneficial for these to be aligned? We look forward to future work applying our methods to larger networks trained on more
structured data, as well as recurrent networks. We also believe it will be valuable to evaluate the effect of attempting to maximize
modularity, as we have defined it, during training, to see to what extent this is possible and whether it leads to performance benefits.
Note that maximizing Q during training is challenging because (i) computing S may require large batches, and more importantly
(ii) optimizing Q is highly prone to local minima, since neural activity and cluster assignments P will tend to reinforce each other,
entrenching accidental clusters that appear at the beginning of training. We suspect that maintaining uncertainty over cluster
assignments (e.g. using soft Pij in [0, 1] rather than hard P in 0, 1 cluster assignments) will be crucial if optimizing any of our
proposed modularity metrics during training.

scores (Q∗) achieved using 1000 Monte Carlo steps, after initializing all units into a single cluster (we chose a random 5% of the

Introduction
The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement
learning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time [1, 2].
This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL
agents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or
hyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability [3]. Our
work introduces a novel intervention, termed ""plasticity injection,"" designed to directly tackle the
root causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared
to existing methods. The core idea behind plasticity injection is to dynamically adjust the learning
capacity of the neural network based on its current learning progress and the complexity of the
environment. This adaptive approach contrasts with traditional methods that either maintain a fixed
network architecture or employ computationally intensive retraining procedures. We hypothesize
that by carefully monitoring the agent’s learning trajectory and selectively injecting plasticity where
needed, we can significantly improve the long-term performance and robustness of RL agents. This
targeted approach minimizes unnecessary computational overhead and avoids the potential negative
consequences of over-parameterization. Furthermore, our framework provides valuable insights into
the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, contributing to a deeper understanding of this critical
issue in RL.
Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for
identifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability
allows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant. This diagnostic
framework leverages a novel metric that quantifies the agent’s ability to adapt to changes in the
environment. By continuously monitoring this metric, we can detect early signs of plasticity loss and
trigger the plasticity injection mechanism. The metric is designed to be computationally efficient and
robust to noise, ensuring that the diagnostic process does not significantly impact the overall training
time. The specific details of this metric are discussed in Section 3.
Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of
trainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the
computational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This is
achieved by selectively modifying the learning rates of specific neurons or layers within the network,
.
rather than adding new parameters. This targeted approach allows us to fine-tune the network’s
plasticity without disrupting its overall functionality. The selection of neurons or layers is guided by
the diagnostic framework, ensuring that plasticity injection is focused on the areas of the network
that are most affected by plasticity loss.
Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved
computational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary
resource consumption during periods of stable performance. This dynamic capacity expansion is
achieved by adding new neurons or layers only when the diagnostic framework indicates a significant
decline in the agent’s adaptability. This ensures that the network’s complexity remains minimal
during periods of stable performance, reducing computational overhead and preventing overfitting.
The specific mechanism for dynamic capacity expansion is detailed in Section 4. The overall design
of plasticity injection aims to create a self-regulating system that adapts to the challenges of plasticity
loss in a computationally efficient and robust manner.
The effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,
including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate
a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-
the-art baselines. These results are presented and analyzed in detail in Section 5. The proposed
plasticity injection framework offers a significant advancement in addressing plasticity loss in RL.
Its ability to diagnose, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges of plasticity loss without substantial
computational overhead makes it a promising approach for deploying RL agents in real-world
applications. Future research will focus on extending the framework to more complex scenarios and
exploring its integration with other advanced RL techniques.

Related Work
The problem of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning has received increasing attention
in recent years. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, but they often
suffer from limitations in terms of computational efficiency or generalizability. Early work focused
primarily on architectural modifications, such as incorporating mechanisms for continual learning
[4, 5]. These methods often involve significant changes to the network architecture, leading to
increased computational complexity and potential instability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these
architectural modifications can be highly task-specific, limiting their generalizability to different RL
environments.
Another line of research has explored the use of regularization techniques to improve the stability
and plasticity of RL agents [6, 7]. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the
loss function, encouraging the network to maintain a certain level of plasticity. However, the
choice of regularization parameters can be crucial and often requires careful tuning, which can
be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the effectiveness of regularization
techniques can vary significantly depending on the specific RL algorithm and environment.
More recently, there has been a growing interest in meta-learning approaches for improving the
adaptability of RL agents [8, 9]. These methods aim to learn a general-purpose learning algorithm
that can quickly adapt to new tasks or environments. While meta-learning techniques have shown
promising results in certain scenarios, they often require significant computational resources for
training the meta-learner. Furthermore, the performance of meta-learning methods can be sensitive to
the choice of meta-learning algorithm and the design of the meta-training process.
Our proposed plasticity injection framework differs from these existing approaches in several key
aspects. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticity
loss, allowing for proactive intervention. Second, it mitigates plasticity loss without requiring
significant architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. Third, it dynamically expands
network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency. These features
make plasticity injection a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods for
addressing plasticity loss in RL. The unique combination of diagnostic capabilities, targeted plasticity
adjustments, and adaptive capacity allocation distinguishes our approach from previous work.
Finally, the focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss through a novel
diagnostic metric provides valuable insights that can inform the development of future methods.

This deeper understanding of the causes of plasticity loss is crucial for designing more robust and
adaptable RL agents. Our work contributes to the broader field of continual learning and aims to
advance the state-of-the-art in building truly resilient and long-lasting RL agents.

Methodology
Our proposed approach, termed ""plasticity injection,"" addresses plasticity loss in deep reinforcement
learning agents through a three-pronged strategy: diagnosis, mitigation, and adaptive capacity
expansion. The core of our methodology lies in a novel diagnostic metric that continuously monitors
the agent’s learning trajectory and adaptability. This metric, detailed in Section 3, quantifies the
agent’s ability to respond to environmental changes, providing a sensitive indicator of plasticity loss
onset and severity. Early detection is crucial, allowing for proactive intervention before significant
performance degradation occurs. The computational efficiency of this metric is paramount, ensuring
minimal disruption to the overall training process. We employ a sliding window approach to smooth
out short-term fluctuations in the metric, enhancing its robustness to noise and providing a more
reliable signal for intervention. The threshold for triggering plasticity injection is dynamically
adjusted based on the agent’s performance history, adapting to the inherent variability of different
RL environments. This adaptive thresholding prevents premature or unnecessary interventions,
optimizing the efficiency of our approach. The diagnostic framework forms the foundation upon
which the subsequent mitigation and capacity expansion strategies are built.
The mitigation strategy focuses on targeted adjustments to the network’s learning dynamics, rather
than wholesale architectural changes. Instead of adding new parameters, we selectively modify
the learning rates of specific neurons or layers identified by the diagnostic framework as being
most affected by plasticity loss. This targeted approach minimizes computational overhead while
preserving the integrity of the learned policy. We employ a gradient-based optimization technique to
determine the optimal learning rate adjustments for each identified neuron or layer. This optimization
process considers both the current learning progress and the agent’s overall performance, ensuring
that the adjustments are both effective and stable. The learning rate adjustments are implemented
using a dynamic scaling factor, which is continuously updated based on the diagnostic metric. This
dynamic scaling ensures that the plasticity injection mechanism adapts to the evolving needs of the
agent throughout the training process. The specific algorithm for determining the optimal learning
rate adjustments is detailed in Appendix A.
Adaptive capacity expansion is triggered only when the diagnostic metric indicates a significant
and persistent decline in the agent’s adaptability, despite the mitigation efforts. This ensures that
computational resources are not wasted on unnecessary capacity increases during periods of stable
performance. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network,
strategically placed based on the information provided by the diagnostic framework. The addition of
new neurons or layers is guided by a principled approach that minimizes disruption to the existing
network architecture and ensures seamless integration of the new capacity. We employ a gradual
expansion strategy, adding a small number of neurons or layers at a time, to avoid sudden changes
that could destabilize the training process. The specific architecture of the added neurons or layers
is determined based on the nature of the plasticity loss detected by the diagnostic framework. This
targeted expansion ensures that the added capacity is effectively utilized to address the specific
challenges posed by plasticity loss.
The effectiveness of plasticity injection is rigorously evaluated across a diverse set of challenging
RL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. These
benchmarks are carefully selected to represent a wide range of complexities and challenges commonly
encountered in real-world applications. We compare the performance of our approach against several
state-of-the-art baselines, including methods based on architectural modifications, regularization tech-
niques, and meta-learning. The results, presented in Section 5, demonstrate a consistent improvement
in long-term performance and learning stability across all benchmarks. Furthermore, the diagnostic
component of plasticity injection provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of
plasticity loss, offering a deeper understanding of this critical issue in RL. The detailed experimental
setup and results are presented in Appendix B.
Our methodology contributes significantly to the field of continual learning by providing a novel and
efficient approach to address plasticity loss in RL agents. The combination of proactive diagnosis,
3
targeted mitigation, and adaptive capacity expansion allows for a robust and adaptable system that
maintains high performance over extended periods. The insights gained from this research pave the
way for more resilient and long-lasting RL agents, crucial for deploying these agents in complex and
dynamic real-world scenarios. Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle even
more complex environments and integrating it with other advanced RL techniques.

work. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach across a diverse set of challenging reinforcement
learning (RL) benchmarks, encompassing both continuous control tasks and partially observable en-
vironments. These benchmarks were carefully selected to represent a broad spectrum of complexities
and challenges commonly encountered in real-world applications. The selection criteria included the
presence of significant plasticity loss in baseline agents, the diversity of task structures, and the com-
putational feasibility of extensive training runs. Our experiments focused on assessing the long-term
performance and learning stability of agents trained using plasticity injection, compared to several
state-of-the-art baselines. These baselines included methods based on architectural modifications,
regularization techniques, and meta-learning approaches, each representing a distinct strategy for
addressing plasticity loss in RL. The comparative analysis allowed us to rigorously evaluate the
advantages and limitations of our proposed framework. The experimental results are presented and
analyzed in detail below, providing a comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of plasticity injection.
Our experimental setup involved training multiple agents for each benchmark using different methods:
plasticity injection, and three state-of-the-art baselines (Baseline A, Baseline B, and Baseline C).
Each agent was trained for a fixed number of timesteps, allowing for a direct comparison of their
long-term performance and learning stability. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics
appropriate for each benchmark, such as average cumulative reward, success rate, and learning curves.

of timesteps, providing a clear visualization of the learning progress and stability of each agent.
Statistical significance was assessed using paired t-tests, comparing the performance of plasticity
injection against each baseline. The significance level was set at α = 0.05. The detailed experimental

indicating the robustness of our approach. Furthermore, the smaller standard deviations observed for
plasticity injection suggest greater learning stability and reduced variance in performance. Figure
1 (in Appendix B) provides a detailed visualization of the learning curves for each method and
benchmark, further illustrating the superior long-term performance and stability of plasticity injection.

Results
This section presents the experimental results obtained using the plasticity injection framework.
We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach across four challenging reinforcement learning
(RL) benchmarks: two continuous control tasks (CCT1 and CCT2) and two partially observable
environments (POE1 and POE2). These benchmarks were chosen to represent a diverse range of
complexities and challenges commonly encountered in real-world applications. Specifically, CCT1
and CCT2 involved controlling simulated robotic arms to achieve specific goals, while POE1 and
POE2 presented partially observable scenarios requiring the agent to infer hidden states from limited
sensory information. The selection criteria included the presence of significant plasticity loss in
baseline agents, the diversity of task structures, and the computational feasibility of extensive training
runs. Our experiments focused on assessing the long-term performance and learning stability of
agents trained using plasticity injection, compared to three state-of-the-art baselines (Baseline A,
Baseline B, and Baseline C). These baselines represented distinct strategies for addressing plasticity
loss, including architectural modifications, regularization techniques, and meta-learning approaches.
The comparative analysis allowed for a rigorous evaluation of the advantages and limitations of our
proposed framework.
The experimental setup involved training multiple agents for each benchmark using each of the four
methods. Each agent was trained for 1 million timesteps, allowing for a direct comparison of their
long-term performance and learning stability. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics
appropriate for each benchmark, including average cumulative reward, success rate, and learning
curves. Learning curves were generated by plotting the average reward obtained over a sliding
window of 10,000 timesteps, providing a clear visualization of the learning progress and stability of
each agent. Statistical significance was assessed using paired t-tests, comparing the performance of
plasticity injection against each baseline. The significance level was set at α = 0.05.

averaged over the final 200,000 timesteps of training. The results consistently demonstrate the superior
performance of plasticity injection compared to all baselines. All improvements are statistically

variance.

Evaluation
Abstract
This paper introduces a novel semantic similarity metric designed for image regis-
tration. Current metrics, such as Euclidean distance or normalized cross-correlation,
primarily focus on aligning intensity values, which presents challenges when deal-
ing with low contrast or noise. Our approach utilizes learned, dataset-specific
features to guide the optimization of learning-based registration models. In com-
parisons with existing unsupervised and supervised methods across various image
modalities and applications, our method demonstrates consistently superior regis-
tration accuracy and faster convergence. Additionally, its learned noise invariance
results in smoother transformations on lower-quality images.
1
Introduction
This paper delves into the significant area of deformable registration, an essential preprocessing
step in medical imaging. The primary objective is to ascertain anatomical correspondences between
images and determine geometric transformations, denoted as Φ, for their alignment. The majority
of algorithmic and deep learning-based techniques achieve alignment by optimizing a similarity
measure, D, and a λ-weighted regularizer, R, which are combined to form a loss function:
L(I, J, Φ) = D(I ◦Φ, J) + λR(Φ).
(1)
The alignment is critically evaluated by the similarity metric, D, which significantly impacts the
final outcome. Common pixel-based metrics, such as Euclidean distance (MSE) and patch-wise
normalized cross-correlation (NCC), are used in both algorithmic and deep learning approaches to
image registration. Typically, a similarity measure for a particular task is selected from a small set of
metrics, with no certainty that any of them is suitable for the data.
The limitations of pixel-based similarity metrics have been extensively studied in the image generation
field, where the adoption of deep similarity metrics, designed to emulate human visual perception, has
enhanced the generation of highly realistic images. Because registration models are also generative,
we anticipate that employing these similarity metrics could also improve registration results. However,
current methods that use learned similarity metrics for image registration require ground truth
transformations, or they restrict the input to the registration model.
We propose a data-driven similarity metric for image registration that relies on aligning semantic
features. Our metric uses learned semantic filters specific to the dataset, which are then used to train
a registration model. We have validated our method using three biomedical datasets characterized by
varying image modalities and applications. Across all datasets, our approach achieves consistently
high registration accuracy, even outperforming metrics that use supervised information. Our models
also demonstrate quicker convergence and learn to overlook noisy image patches, leading to more
consistent transformations on lower-quality data.
.
2
A Deep Similarity Metric for Image Registration
To align areas with comparable semantic content, we propose a similarity metric based on the
consensus of semantic feature representations between two images. These semantic feature maps
are generated by a feature extractor, trained through a surrogate segmentation task. To capture
the alignment of both localized, specific features and more abstract, global ones, we compute the
similarity across multiple layers of abstraction.
Given a set of feature-extracting functions, Fl : RΩ×C →RΩl×Cl, for L layers, we define:
DeepSim(I ◦Φ, J) =
L
X
l=1
1
|Ωl|
X
p∈Ωl
Fl(I ◦Φ)p · Fl(J)p
∥Fl(I ◦Φ)p∥∥Fl(J)p∥
(2)
where Fl(J)p denotes the l-th layer feature extractor applied to image J at spatial coordinate p. It is
represented as a vector of Cl output channels, and the spatial size of the l-th feature map is denoted
as |Ωl|. The metric is influenced by the pixel’s neighborhood, since Fl uses convolutional filters with
an expanding receptive area. Note that the formulation, using cosine similarity, mirrors the classic
NCC metric, which can be interpreted as the squared cosine-similarity between two zero-mean patch
description vectors.
To improve registration, the functions Fl(·) should extract features that are semantically relevant
to the registration task, while ignoring noise and artifacts. This is achieved by training the feature
extractor on an additional segmentation task, since segmentation models excel at learning pertinent
kernels while also achieving invariance to features like noise that are not predictive. The convolutional
filters obtained act as feature extractors for DeepSim.
3
Experiments
We evaluated registration models trained with DeepSim against baseline metrics such as MSE,
NCC, NCCsup (NCC using supervised information), and VGG (a VGG-based metric used in image
generation, similar to our approach). The model architecture is shown in Figure 1. For both
registration and segmentation, we used U-nets. The registration network predicts the transformation
Φ based on two input images, I and J. The spatial transformer module applies Φ to obtain the
morphed image I ◦Φ. The loss function is as in Eq. 1; we chose the diffusion regularizer for R and
fine-tuned the hyperparameter λ on the validation sets.
To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method across various registration tasks, we assessed it
using three datasets of both 2D and 3D images with different image modalities: T1-weighted Brain-
MRI scans, human blood cells from the Platelet-EM dataset, and cell tracking from the PhC-U373
dataset. Each dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets.

signed-rank test for paired samples. The null hypothesis for each similarity metric was that the model

trained with DeepSim would perform better. Statistical significance levels were set at p∗= 0.05,
p∗∗= 0.01, and p∗∗∗= 0.001. Additionally, we used Cohen’s d to measure the effect size. Models
trained with our proposed DeepSim were ranked highest on both the Brain-MRI and Platelet-EM
datasets, exhibiting strong statistical significance. In the PhC-U373 dataset, all models achieved a
high dice-overlap exceeding 0.97. DeepSim converged faster than the baseline models, particularly
during the initial training epochs.
Qualitative Examples Transformation Grids: We display the fixed and moving images, I and
J, along with the transformed image I ◦Φ, for each similarity metric model in Figure 2(a), and a
more detailed view of a noisy patch from the Platelet-EM dataset in Figure 2(b). The transformation
is shown using grid-lines, which were transformed from an evenly spaced grid. We observed
considerably distorted transformation fields in noisy image areas in models trained with the baselines.
Specifically, models trained with NCC and NCCsup demonstrated highly irregular transformations,
despite the careful adjustment of the regularization hyperparameter. The model trained with DeepSim
showed greater invariance to noise.
5
Discussion and Conclusion
Registration models trained with DeepSim show substantial registration accuracy across multiple
datasets, which improves downstream medical analysis and diagnostics. The reliability of our
proposed metric reduces the need for testing multiple traditional metrics. Instead of experimentally
determining whether MSE or NCC best captures the properties of a dataset, DeepSim can be used to
learn the appropriate features from the data.
The analysis of noisy patches in Figure 2(b) highlights an inherent resistance to noise. Pixel-based
similarity metrics are influenced by artifacts, leading to excessively detailed transformation fields,
which DeepSim does not exhibit. Although smoother transformation fields can be achieved for
all metrics by increasing the regularizer, this would negatively affect the registration precision of
anatomically important areas. Accurate registration of noisy, low-quality images allows for shorter
acquisition times and reduced radiation in medical applications.
DeepSim is a general metric that can be applied to image registration across all modalities and
anatomies. Beyond the presented datasets, good results on low-quality data suggest that DeepSim
could improve registration accuracy in lung CT and ultrasound imaging, where details are difficult to
identify, and image quality is often compromised. Furthermore, DeepSim is not restricted to deep
learning; algorithmic image registration follows a comparable optimization structure where similarity-
based loss is minimized through gradient descent methods. Applying DeepSim in algorithmic
methods can improve their performance by aligning deep, semantic feature embeddings.

Broader Impact
The widespread applications of medical image registration significantly amplify the broader impact
of our work. Some of the typical applications include neuroscience, CT imaging of the lungs and
abdomen, as well as the fusion and combination of different modalities.
The use of deep learning for image registration, while capable of achieving remarkable outcomes
across many different applications, often necessitates the training of models using specialized
hardware over extended periods. This energy-intensive task may raise carbon emissions, which are
a major contributor to climate change. By introducing a method that learns a semantic similarity
metric directly from data, we hope to eliminate the need for excessive testing of other loss functions.
This can reduce the number of model configurations tested during the development of deep learning
methods, thus contributing to a lower environmental impact within the image registration community.

prediction. We also discuss specific challenges of the car-related problems and
other potential applications that worth further investigations.

verification, thanks to more training data and better network structures. The
experimental results can serve as baselines in any later research works. The settings

Introduction
Cars represent a revolution in mobility and convenience, bringing us the flexibility of moving from
place to place. The societal benefits (and cost) are far-reaching. Cars are now indispensable from our
modern life as a vehicle for transportation. In many places, the car is also viewed as a tool to help
project someone’s economic status, or reflects our economic stratification. In addition, the car has
evolved into a subject of interest amongst many car enthusiasts in the world. In general, the demand
on car has shifted over the years to cover not only practicality and reliability, but also high comfort
and design. The enormous number of car designs and car model makes car a rich object class, which
can potentially foster more sophisticated and robust computer vision models and algorithms.
Cars present several unique properties that other objects cannot offer, which provides more challenges
and facilitates a range of novel research topics in object categorization. Specifically, cars own large
quantity of models that most other categories do not have, enabling a more challenging fine-grained
task. In addition, cars yield large appearance differences in their unconstrained poses, which demands
viewpoint-aware analyses and algorithms (see Fig. 1(b)). Importantly, a unique hierarchy is presented
for the car category, which is three levels from top to bottom: make, model, and released year.
This structure indicates a direction to address the fine-grained task in a hierarchical way, which is
only discussed by limited literature. Apart from the categorization task, cars reveal a number of
interesting computer vision problems. Firstly, different designing styles are applied by different
car manufacturers and in different years, which opens the door to fine-grained style analysis and
.
fine-grained part recognition (see Fig. 1(c)). Secondly, the car is an attractive topic for attribute
prediction. In particular, cars have distinctive attributes such as car class, seating capacity, number
of axles, maximum speed and displacement, which can be inferred from the appearance of the cars
(see Fig. 1(a)). Lastly, in comparison to human face verification, car verification, which targets at
verifying whether two cars belong to the same model, is an interesting and under- researched problem.
The unconstrained viewpoints make car verification arguably more challenging than traditional face
verification.
Automated car model analysis, particularly the fine- grained car categorization and verification, can be
used for innumerable purposes in intelligent transportation sys- tem including regulation, description
and indexing. For instance, fine-grained car categorization can be exploited to inexpensively automate
and expedite paying tolls from the lanes, based on different rates for different types of vehicles.
In video surveillance applications, car verification from appearance helps tracking a car over a
multiple camera network when car plate recognition fails. In post-event in- vestigation, similar
cars can be retrieved from the database with car verification algorithms. Car model analysis also
bears significant value in the personal car consumption. When people are planning to buy cars, they
tend to observe cars in the street. Think of a mobile application, which can instantly show a user
the detailed information of a car once a car photo is taken. Such an application will provide great
convenience when people want to know the information of an unrecognized car. Other applications
such as predicting popularity based on the appearance of a car, and recommending cars with similar
styles can be beneficial both for manufacturers and consumers.
Despite the huge research and practical interests, car model analysis only attracts few attentions
in the computer vision community. We believe the lack of high quality datasets greatly limits the
exploration of the community in this domain. To this end, we collect and organize a large-scale
and comprehensive image database called “Comprehensive Cars”, with “CompCars” being short.
The “CompCars” dataset is much larger in scale and diversity compared with the current car image
datasets, containing 208, 826 images of 1, 716 car models from two scenarios: web-nature and
surveillance-nature. In addition, the dataset is carefully labelled with viewpoints and car parts, as well
as rich attributes such as type of car, seat capacity, and door number. The new dataset dataset thus
provides a comprehensive platform to validate the effectiveness of a wide range of computer vision
algorithms. It is also ready to be utilized for realistic applications and enormous novel research topics.
Moreover, the multi-scenario nature en- ables the use of the dataset for cross modality research. The
detailed description of CompCars is provided in Section 3.
To validate the usefulness of the dataset and to encourage the community to explore for more novel
research topics, we demonstrate several interesting applications with the dataset, including car model
classification and verification based on convolutional neural network (CNN). An- other interesting
task is to predict attributes from novel car models (see details in Section 4.2). The experiments reveal
several challenges specific to the car-related problems. We conclude our analyses with a discussion
in Section 7.

Related Work
Most previous car model research focuses on car model classification. propose an evolutionary
computing framework to fit a wireframe model to the car on an image. Then the wireframe model is
employed for car model recognition. construct 3D space curves using 2D training images, then match
the 3D curves to 2D image curves using a 3D view-based alignment technique. The car model is
finally determined with the alignment result. optimize 3D model fitting and fine-grained classification
jointly. All these works are restricted to a small number of car models. Recently, propose to extract
3D car representation for classifying 196 car models. The experiment is the largest scale that we
are aware of. Car model classification is a fine-grained categorization task. In contrast to general
object classification, fine-grained categorization targets at recognizing the subcategories in one object
class. Fol- lowing this line of research, many studies have proposed different datasets on a variety
of categories: birds, dogs, cars, flowers, etc. But all these datasets are limited by their scales and
subcategory numbers.
To our knowledge, there is no previous attempt on the car model verification task. Closely related to
car model verification, face verification has been a popular topic. The recent deep learning based
algorithms first train a deep neural network on human identity clas- sification, then train a verification
2
model with the feature extracted from the deep neural network. Joint Bayesian is a widely-used
verification model that models two faces jointly with an appropriate prior on the face representation.
We adopt Joint Bayesian as a baseline model in car model verification.
Attribute prediction of humans is a popular research topic in recent years. However, a large portion
of the labeled attributes in the current attribute datasets, such as long hair and short pants lack strict
criteria, which causes annotation ambiguities. The attributes with ambiguities will potentially harm
the effectiveness of evaluation on related datasets. In contrast, the attributes provided by CompCars
(e.g. maximum speed, door number, seat capacity) all have strict criteria since they are set by the car
manufacturers. The dataset is thus advantageous over the current datasets in terms of the attributes
validity.
Other car-related research includes detection, track- ing, joint detection and pose estimation, and 3D
parsing. Fine-grained car models are not explored in these studies. Previous research related to car
parts includes car logo recognition and car style analysis based on mid-level features.
Similar to CompCars, the Cars dataset also targets at fine-grained tasks on the car category. Apart
from the larger-scale database, our CompCars dataset offers several significant benefits in comparison
to the Cars dataset. First, our dataset contains car images diversely distributed in all viewpoints
(annotated by front, rear, side, front-side, and rear-side), while Cars dataset mostly consists of front-
side car images. Second, our dataset contains aligned car part images, which can be utilized for many
computer vision algorithms that demand precise alignment. Third, our dataset provides rich attribute
annotations for each car model, which are absent in the Cars dataset.

Properties of CompCars
The CompCars dataset contains data from two scenarios, including images from web-nature and
surveillance-nature. The images of the web-nature are collected from car forums, public websites,
and search engines. The images of the surveillance-nature are collected by surveillance cameras. The
data of these two scenarios are widely used in the real-world applications. They open the door for
cross-modality analysis of cars. In particular, the web-nature data contains 163 car makes with 1, 716
car models, covering most of the commercial car models in the recent ten years. There are a total of
136, 727 images capturing the entire cars and 27, 618 images capturing the car parts, where most
of them are labeled with attributes and viewpoints. The surveillance-nature data contains 44, 481
car images captured in the front view. Each image in the surveillance-nature partition is annotated
with bounding box, model, and color of the car. Fig. 2 illustrates some examples of surveillance
images, which are affected by large variations from lightings and haze. Note that the data from the
surveillance-nature are significantly different from the web-nature data in Fig. 1, suggesting the great
challenges in cross-scenario car analysis. Overall, CompCars dataset offers four unique features in
comparison to existing car image databases, namely car hierarchy, car attributes, viewpoints, and car
parts. the
Car Hierarchy The car models can be organized into a large tree structure, consisting of three layers
, namely car make, car model, and year of manufacture, top to bottom as depicted in Fig. 3. The
complexity is further compounded by the fact that each car model can be produced in different years,
yielding subtle difference in their appearances. For instance, three versions of “Audi A4L” were
produced between 2009 to 2011 respectively. from
Car Attributes Each car model is labeled with five at- tributes, including maximum speed, displace-
ment, number of doors, number of seats, and type of car. These attributes provide rich information
while learning the relations or similarities between different car models. For example, we define
twelve types of cars, which are MPV, SUV, hatchback, sedan, minibus, fastback, estate, pickup, sports,
crossover, convertible, and hardtop convertible, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, these attributes
can be partitioned into two groups: explicit and implicit attributes. The former group contains door
number, seat number, and car type, which are represented by discrete values, while the latter group
contains maximum speed and displacement (volume of an engine’s cylinders), represented by contin-
uous values. Humans can easily tell the numbers of doors and seats from a car’s proper viewpoint,
but hardly recognize its maximum speed and displacement. We conduct interesting experiments to
predict these attributes in Section 4.2.
3
Viewpoints We also label five viewpoints for each car model, including front (F), rear (R), side (S),
front-side (FS), and rear-side (RS). These viewpoints are labeled by several professional annotators.
The quantity distribution of the labeled car images is shown in Table 1. Note that the numbers of
viewpoint images are not balanced among different car models, because the images of some less
popular car models are difficult to collect.
Car Parts We collect images capturing the eight car parts for each car model, including four exterior
parts (i.e. headlight, taillight, fog light, and air intake) and four interior parts (i.e. console, steering
wheel, dashboard, and gear lever). These images are roughly aligned for the convenience of further
analysis. A summary and some examples are given in Table 2 and Fig. 5 respectively.

Applications
In this section, we study three applications using CompCars, including fine-grained car classification,
attribute prediction, and car verification. We select 78, 126 images from the CompCars dataset and
divide them into three subsets without overlaps. The first subset (Part-I) contains 431 car models with
a total of 30, 955 images capturing the entire car and 20, 349 images capturing car parts. The second
subset (Part-II) consists 111 models with 4, 454 images in total. The last subset (Part-III) contains 1,
145 car models with 22, 236 images. Fine-grained car classification is conducted using images in the
first subset. For attribute prediction, the models are trained on the first subset but tested on the second
one. The last subset is utilized for car verification.
We investigate the above potential applications using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which
achieves great empirical successes in many computer vision prob- lems, such as object classification,
detection, face alignment, and face verification. Specifically, we employ the Overfeat model, which
is pretrained on ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the car images for car classification
and attribute prediction. For car model verification, the fine-tuned model is employed as a feature
extractor.
4.1
Fine-Grained Classification
We classify the car images into 431 car models. For each car model, the car images produced in
different years are considered as a single category. One may treat them as different categories, leading
to a more challenging problem because their differences are relatively small. Our experiments have
two settings, comprising fine-grained classification with the entire car images and the car parts. For
both settings, we divide the data into half for training and another half for testing. Car model labels
are regarded as training target and logistic loss is used to fine-tune the Overfeat model.

4.1.1
The Entire Car Images
We compare the recognition performances of the CNN models, which are fine-tuned with car images
in specific viewpoints and all the viewpoints respectively, denoted as “front (F)”, “rear (R)”, “side
(S)”, “front-side (FS)”, “rear- side (RS)”, and “All-View”. The performances of these six models are
summarized in Table 3, where “FS” and “RS” achieve better performances than the performances
of the other viewpoint models. Surprisingly, the “All- View” model yields the best performance,
although it did not leverage the information of viewpoints. This result reveals that the CNN model is
capable of learning discriminative representation across different views. To verify this observation,
we visualize the car images that trigger high responses with respect to each neuron in the last fully-
connected layer. As shown in Fig. 6, these neurons capture car images of specific car models across
different viewpoints.
Several challenging cases are given in Fig. 7, where the images on the left hand side are the testing
images and the images on the right hand side are the examples of the wrong predictions (of the
“All-View” model). We found that most of the wrong predictions belong to the same car makes as the
test images. We report the “top- 1” accuracies of car make classification in the last row of Table 3,
where the “All-View” model obtain reasonable good result, indicating that a coarse-to-fine (i.e. from
car make to model) classification is possible for fine-grained car recognition.
To observe the learned feature space of the “All-View” model, we project the features extracted
from the last fully- connected layer to a two-dimensional embedding space using multi-dimensional
scaling. Fig. 8 visualizes the projected features of twelve car models, where the images are chosen
from different viewpoints. We observe that features from different models are separable in the 2D
space and features of similar models are closer than those of dissimilar models. For instance, the
distances between “BWM 5 Series” and “BWM 7 Series” are smaller than those between “BWM 5
Series” and “Chevrolet Captiva”.
We also conduct a cross-modality experiment, where the CNN model fine-tuned by the web-nature
data is evaluated on the surveillance-nature data. Fig. 9 illustrates some predictions, suggesting that
the model may account for data variations in a different modality to a certain extent. This experiment
indicates that the features obtained from the web-nature data have potential to be transferred to data
in the other scenario.

Car Parts
Car enthusiasts are able to distinguish car models by examining the car parts. We investigate if
the CNN model can mimic this strength. We train a CNN model using images from each of the
eight car parts. The results are reported in Table 4, where “taillight” demonstrates the best accuracy.
We visualize taillight images that have high responses with respect to each neuron in the last fully-
connected layer. Fig. 10 displays such images with respect to two neurons. “Taillight” wins among
the different car parts, mostly likely due to the relatively more distinctive designs, and the model
name printed close to the taillight, which is a very informative feature for the CNN model.
We also combine predictions using the eight car part models by voting strategy. This strategy
significantly improves the performance due to the complementary nature of different car parts.
4.2
Attribute Prediction
Human can easily identify the car attributes such as numbers of doors and seats from a proper
viewpoint, without knowing the car model. For example, a car image captured in the side view

provides sufficient information of the door number and car type, but it is hard to infer these attributes
from the frontal view. The appearance of a car also provides hints on the implicit attributes, such
as the maximum speed and the displacement. For instance, a car model is probably designed for
high-speed driving, if it has a low under-pan and a streamline body.
In this section, we deliberately design a challenging experimental setting for attribute recognition,
where the car models presented in the test images are exclusive from the training images. We fine-tune
the CNN with the sum- of-square loss to model the continuous attributes, such as “maximum speed”
and “displacement”, but a logistic loss to predict the discrete attributes such as “door number”, “seat
number”, and “car type”. For example, the “door number” has four states, i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5 doors, while
“seat number” also has four states, i.e. 2, 4, 5, > 5 seats. The attribute “car type” has twelve states as
discussed in Sec. 3.
To study the effectiveness of different viewpoints for attribute prediction, we train CNN models for
different viewpoints separately. Table 5 summarizes the results, where the “mean guess” represents
the errors computed by using the mean of the training set as the prediction. We observe that the
performances of “maximum speed” and “displacement” are insensitive to viewpoints. However, for
the explicit attributes, the best accuracy is obtained under side view. We also found that the the
implicit attributes are more difficult to predict then the explicit attributes. Several test images and
their attribute predictions are provided in Fig. 11.
Table 5: Attribute prediction results for the five single viewpoint models. For the continuous attributes
(maximum speed and displacement), we display the mean difference from the ground truth. For the
discrete attributes (door and seat number, car type), we display the classification accuracy. Mean
guess denotes the mean error with a prediction of the mean value on the training set.

Car Verification
In this section, we perform car verification following the pipeline of face verification. In particular,
we adopt the classification model in Section 4.1.1 as a feature extractor of the car images, and then
apply Joint Bayesian to train a verification model on the Part-II data. Finally, we test the performance
of the model on the Part-III data, which includes 1, 145 car models. The test data is organized into
three sets, each of which has different difficulty, i.e. easy, medium, and hard. Each set contains 20,
000 pairs of images, including 10, 000 positive pairs and 10, 000 negative pairs. Each image pair in
the “easy set” is selected from the same viewpoint, while each pair in the “medium set” is selected
from a pair of random viewpoints. Each negative pair in the “hard set” is chosen from the same car
make.
6
Deeply learned feature combined with Joint Bayesian has been proven successful for face verification.
Joint Bayesian formulates the feature x as the sum of two independent Gaussian variables
x = p + e,
(1)
where p ∼N(0, Σp) represents identity information, and e ∼N(0, Σe) the intra-category variations.
Joint Bayesian models the joint probability of two objects given the intra or extra-category varia-
tion hypothesis, P(x1, x2|HI) and P(x1, x2|HE). These two probabilities are also Gaussian with
variations
ΣI = Σp + Σe,
ΣE = Σp + Σe
(2)
and
ΣI = Σp + Σe,
ΣE = Σe
(3)
respectively. Σp and Σe can be learned from data with EM algorithm. In the testing stage, it calculates
the likelihood ratio
r(x1, x2) = log P(x1, x2|HI)
P(x1, x2|HE),
(4)
which has closed-form solution. The feature extracted from the CNN model has a dimension of 4,
096, which is reduced to 20 by PCA. The compressed features are then utilized to train the Joint
Bayesian model. During the testing stage, each image pair is classified by comparing the likelihood
ratio produced by Joint Bayesian with a threshold. This model is denoted as (CNN feature + Joint
Bayesian).
The second method combines the CNN features and SVM, denoted as CNN feature + SVM. Here,
SVM is a binary classifier using a pair of image features as input. The label ‘1’ represents positive
pair, while ‘0’ represents negative pair. We extract 100, 000 pairs of image features from Part-II data
for training.
The performances of the two models are shown in Table 6 and the ROC curves for the “hard set”
are plotted in Fig. 14. We observe that CNN feature + Joint Bayesian outperforms CNN feature
+ SVM with large margins, indicating the advantage of Joint Bayesian for this task. However, its
benefit in car verification is not as effective as in face verification, where CNN and Joint Bayesian
nearly saturated the LFW dataset and approached human performance. Fig. 12 depicts several pairs
of test images as well as their predictions by CNN feature + Joint Bayesian. We observe two major
challenges. First, for the image pair of the same model but different viewpoints, it is difficult to
obtain the correspondences directly from the raw image pixels. Second, the appearances of different
car models of the same car make are extremely similar. It is difficult to distinguish these car models
using the entire images. Part localization or detection is crucial for car verification.

Updated Results: Comparing Different Deep Models
As an extension to the experiments in Section 4, we conduct experiments for fine-grained car
classification, at- tribute prediction, and car verification with the entire dataset and different deep
models, in order to explore the different capabilities of the models on these tasks. The split of the
dataset into the three tasks is similar to Section 4, where three subsets contain 431, 111, and 1, 145
car models, with 52, 083, 11, 129, and 72, 962 images respectively. The only difference is that we
adopt full set of CompCars in order to establish updated baseline experiments and to make use of the
dataset to the largest extent. We keep the testing sets of car verification same to those in Section 4.3.
We evaluate three network structures, namely AlexNet, Overfeat, and GoogLeNet for all three tasks.
All networks are pre-trained on the ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the same
mini-batch size, epochs, and learning rates for each task. All predictions of the deep models are
produced with a single center crop of the image. We use Caffe as the platform for our experiments.

The experimental results can serve as baselines in any later research works. The train/test splits can
be downloaded from CompCars webpage.

represents the prediction with the mean of the values on the training set. GoogLeNet performs the
best for all attributes and Overfeat is a close running-up.

Car Verification
The evaluation pipeline follows Section 4.3. We evaluate the three deep models combined with two
verification models: Joint Bayesian and SVM with polynomial kernel. The feature extracted from the
CNN models is reduced to 200 by PCA before training and testing in all experiments.
The performances of the three networks combined with the two verification models are shown in
Table 9, where each model is denoted by name of the deep model + name of the verification model.
GoogLeNet + Joint Bayesian achieves the best performance in all three settings. For each deep model,
Joint Bayesian outperforms SVM consistently. Compared to Table 6, Overfeat + Joint Bayesian
yields a performance gain of 2 4

P019.pdf,"Acquiring the Ability to Recommend Interventions for Tuberculosis
Treatment Through the Utilization of Digital Adherence Information
Abstract
Digital Adherence Technologies (DATs) are becoming progressively favored as a means of confirming patients’
adherence to various medications. This paper examines the information gathered from a city that utilizes 99DOTS,
a telephone-based DAT implemented for tuberculosis (TB) treatment in India, where approximately 3 million
individuals are diagnosed with the disease annually. The dataset encompasses approximately 17,000 patients
and 2.1 million dosage records. This research establishes the basis for deriving insights from this real-world
data, encompassing a methodology to circumvent the influence of unrecorded interventions in the training
data employed for machine learning. Subsequently, a deep learning model is developed, its interpretability is
illustrated, and it is demonstrated how it can be modified and trained under diverse clinical conditions to more
effectively target and enhance patient treatment. In the context of real-time risk prediction, the model could be
employed to proactively intervene with 21% more patients and prevent 76% more missed doses compared to
the current heuristic benchmarks. Regarding outcome prediction, the model exhibits 40% improvement over
baseline approaches, enabling cities to allocate more resources to clinics with a higher proportion of patients
susceptible to treatment failure. Lastly, a case study is presented that illustrates how the model can be trained in an
end-to-end, decision-focused learning framework to realize a 15% enhancement in solution quality in a sample
decision problem encountered by healthcare professionals.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified tuberculosis (TB) as one of the leading ten causes of mortality globally, despite
it being a curable and preventable disease in the majority of instances. The widespread occurrence of TB is partially attributable
to inadequate adherence to medication, which leads to an elevated probability of mortality, reinfection, and the development of
drug-resistant strains of TB. To address the issue of non-adherence, the WHO advocates for directly observed treatment (DOT),
wherein a healthcare professional directly observes and validates a patient’s daily intake of the necessary medication. Nevertheless,
the necessity for patients to commute to the DOT facility imposes a financial strain and potentially introduces social stigma because
of the public apprehension surrounding the disease. These obstacles make it challenging to eradicate TB, as they contribute to
patients being lost to follow-up. Consequently, digital adherence technologies (DATs), which offer patients adaptable methods to
demonstrate adherence, have experienced a surge in popularity on a global scale.
DATs empower patients to be ""observed"" consuming their medication electronically through various means, such as two-way
text messaging, video recording, electronic pill containers, or toll-free phone calls. Healthcare professionals can subsequently
monitor patient adherence in real-time using a dashboard. Besides enhancing patient adaptability and confidentiality, the dashboard
empowers healthcare personnel to categorize patients and allocate their constrained resources towards those at the highest risk.
Initial research indicates that DATs have the potential to enhance adherence in various disease contexts, thereby stimulating their
utilization and assessment for the management of TB adherence. The WHO has even issued a manual for the effective incorporation
of this technology in TB patient care.
In this paper, the focus is on investigating how the extensive longitudinal data generated by DATs can be utilized to assist health
workers in better triaging TB patients and providing interventions to enhance the overall adherence of their patient group. The data
under analysis originates from Mumbai, India, and is the result of a collaboration with the City TB Office of Mumbai. They have
put into practice a DAT that enables patients to verify their adherence by making daily toll-free calls. The DAT system was set
up with technical assistance from the healthcare technology company Everwell and is recognized as 99DOTS. Everwell provides
support for the implementation of 99DOTS across India, where there were an estimated 2.7 million cases of TB in 2017. In Mumbai,
patients registered in 99DOTS currently receive interventions based on the following broad guidelines. If they have not taken their
medication by the afternoon, they (and their health worker) get a text message reminder. If the patient still does not take their
medication after some time, the worker will call the patient directly. Lastly, if a patient does not respond to these interventions after
a certain number of days, they may be personally visited by a health worker. It is important to note that a significant number of these
patients reside in communities with limited resources, where each health worker is responsible for managing dozens to hundreds
of patients, far exceeding their capacity for daily visits. Therefore, models that can pinpoint patients at risk of missing doses and
prioritize interventions by health workers are of the utmost importance.
At first, the challenge of determining whom to target for an intervention seems to be a straightforward supervised machine learning
task. Provided with information regarding a patient’s medication adherence as indicated by their calls to the 99DOTS system, it is
possible to train a machine learning model to forecast whether they will miss medication doses in the future. Nevertheless, such a
model disregards the simultaneous interventions carried out by health workers during the data collection period and may result in
erroneous prioritization choices, even when it exhibits high accuracy. As an illustration, it might be observed that missed doses are
succeeded by a phase of medication adherence. This observation does not imply that individuals who miss doses are more inclined
to take medication, but rather suggests that an intervention by a health worker likely occurred, after which the patient resumed their
medication.
Therefore, to prescribe interventions, it’s necessary to separate the impact of manual interventions from other underlying elements
that contribute to missed doses. However, because this data was gathered through a wide-ranging implementation involving actual
patients, it incorporates the impacts of interventions executed by healthcare personnel. An added difficulty is that healthcare workers
seldom document their interventions within the 99DOTS system, making it hard to gauge their consequences. Although there is a
substantial body of research on assessing heterogeneous treatment effects, conventional methods consistently necessitate awareness
of which patients underwent an intervention. It should be noted that such omissions will be prevalent as nations enthusiastically
implement DAT systems with the aim of aiding low-income areas. To facilitate the provision of enhanced care, it is imperative that
we can glean insights from this complex yet abundant data.
Hence, a general strategy is introduced for acquiring knowledge from adherence data with unrecorded interventions, grounded in
domain expertise regarding the intervention heuristics used by healthcare workers. A proxy is created for interventions evident in
the historical 99DOTS data, and a model is devised to aid in prioritizing intervention targets for healthcare workers across various
clinical scenarios.

Methodology
The TB treatment system functions under severe resource constraints; for instance, a single health worker might be in charge of
over 100 patients. Therefore, it is essential that workers can precisely evaluate patient risk and prioritize interventions appropriately.
Although machine learning can be employed to carry out such risk assessment with encouraging precision, it necessitates careful
consideration of how intervention resources were distributed in the current data.
A significant obstacle arises from the fact that users of the 99DOTS platform typically do not document interventions. Health
workers might send texts, make calls, or conduct personal visits to patients in an effort to boost adherence, but these interventions are
not systematically recorded in the data. Although far from perfect, these gaps are unavoidable as countries with varying reporting
standards adopt DATs for TB treatment. Considering the wealth of data produced by DATs and their potential to affect human
lives, the importance of learning lessons in this demanding setting where unobserved interventions take place is emphasized. This
challenge is subsequently addressed by developing a screening procedure that recognizes patients who were probable candidates for
specific interventions.
The aim is to utilize the accessible data to create an approximation for when an intervention likely took place, enabling the training
of models on data points unaffected by interventions. The initial step involves differentiating between various categories of health
worker interventions. Specifically, a house visit is regarded as a ""resource-limited"" intervention, given that workers are unable to visit
all their patients promptly. Typically, this represents a last resort for health workers when patients are unresponsive to alternative
methods. On the other hand, calls and texts are viewed as ""non-resource-limited"" interventions, as they could feasibly be conducted
on a large patient population at minimal expense.
To develop the proxy, a search was conducted for health worker guidelines concerning house visits. The 2005 guide by India’s
Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) mandated that workers perform a house visit after a single missed dose.
However, more recent guidelines are considerably more ambiguous on this matter. Both the latest guide by the WHO and the
RNTCP leave house visits to the health worker’s discretion. Nevertheless, through discussions in Mumbai, it was discerned that
health workers give precedence to non-adherent patients for resource-limited interventions like house visits. Consequently, the proxy
was formulated based on the adherence dashboard accessible to health workers.
The 99DOTS dashboard provides a daily ""Attention Required"" status for each patient. Initially, if a patient has a record in the Patient
Log, signifying that a provider made a note about the patient within the preceding 7 days, their status is automatically adjusted to
""MEDIUM"" attention. However, this guideline impacts fewer than 1% of the labels. The remaining 99% of labels are determined as
follows: if a patient misses 0 or 1 doses in the past 7 days, their attention level is changed to ""MEDIUM."" If they miss 4 or more, it
is changed to ""HIGH."" Patients with 2-3 missed doses maintain their attention level from the day before. As a conservative proxy, it
was assumed that only ""HIGH"" attention patients were candidates for resource-limited interventions, considering that the attention
level serves as a health worker’s primary overview of recent patient adherence. This ""Attention Required"" system for screening
resource-limited interventions is applicable to any daily adherence context; one only needs to ascertain the threshold for a change to
HIGH attention.
2
Employing this screening system, sequences of days can be identified during which a patient was a candidate for a resource-limited
intervention, and subsequently, the use of signal from those days in the training task can be avoided.
3
Experiments
The objective was to create a model that mirrors the daily routine of a health worker, which involves analyzing their patients’ recent
call records to gauge adherence risk and subsequently planning various types of interventions. Enhanced prediction capabilities
enable workers to engage with a greater number of patients proactively, prior to their missing crucial doses.
The process began with the entire group of 16,975 patients and proceeded to create training samples from each patient in the
following manner. All consecutive sequences of 14 days of call data were considered, ensuring that the initial 7 days of each
sequence did not overlap. The first 7 days of each patient’s treatment, as well as the final day, were omitted to prevent any bias that
might arise from interactions with health workers during the initiation or conclusion of treatment. Two filtering steps were then
implemented. Initially, samples were excluded where the patient had in excess of 2 doses manually recorded by a provider during the
input sequence, as these patients likely had contact with their provider outside of the 99DOTS system. Secondly, samples in which
the patient did not miss any doses in the input sequence were removed. Although these samples constituted the majority of the data,
they included almost no positive (HIGH risk) labels, which distorted the training process. Moreover, positive predictions for patients
who missed 0 doses are improbable to be beneficial; no resource-limited intervention can be implemented so extensively that patients
with flawless recent adherence are targeted. The aforementioned steps yielded 16,015 samples, of which 2,437 were positive.
Each sample comprised a time-series of call data along with static characteristics. The time series encompassed two sequences of 7
in length for every sample. The initial sequence was a binary representation of call data, where 1 signified a call or manual dose
and 0 indicated a miss. The subsequent sequence represented a cumulative count of all doses missed up to that specific day, taking
into account the patient’s entire history within the program. The static features incorporated four demographic attributes from the
Patient Table: weight-band, age-band, gender, and treatment center ID. Supplementary features were derived from the patient Call
Logs and captured a patient’s behavior beyond mere adherence. For instance, did the patient call at a consistent time each morning
or at irregular intervals throughout the day? This was captured by calculating the mean and variance of the call minute and hour.
Additional features encompassed the number of calls, number of manual doses, and the mean, maximum, and variance of calls per
day, in addition to days per call. Analogous features were also incorporated, which exclusively utilized unique calls per day (i.e.,
calls to distinct phone numbers) or disregarded manual doses. This procedure resulted in 29 descriptive features.
Initially, standard models were tested that utilize solely the static features: linear regression, a random forest (with 100 trees and a
maximum depth of 5), and a support vector machine. The random forest exhibited the best performance, so the others are omitted for
the sake of clarity. To make use of the time series data, a deep network was also constructed, designated as LEAP (Lstm rEal-time
Adherence Predictor), which accepts both the time series and static features as input. LEAP comprises two input layers: 1) an LSTM
with 64 hidden units for the time series input, and 2) a dense layer with 100 units for the static feature input. The outputs of these
two layers were concatenated and fed forward into another dense layer with 16 units, followed by a single sigmoid activation unit. A
batch size of 128 was employed, and training was conducted for 20 epochs.
To assess the models, all data was randomized, and 25% was set aside as the test set. A 4-fold grid search was employed to ascertain
the optimal model parameters. To address class imbalance, SMOTE was utilized to oversample the training set, implemented using
the Python library imblearn. Features were also normalized as percentiles using SKLearn, which was empirically found to be
effective. The benchmark for comparison was the method employed by the current 99DOTS platform to evaluate risk, namely, doses
missed by the patient in the preceding week (lw-Misses).
4
Results
The models were compared against the baseline. The random forest slightly surpasses the baseline, and LEAP distinctly outperforms
both. Nevertheless, to gauge the efficacy of the methods relative to the baseline, a comparison is made regarding how each method
could be applied to strategize house-visit interventions. Given that this constitutes a highly constrained resource, the most stringent
baseline threshold was established to contemplate patients for this intervention, specifically, 3 missed calls. Maintaining the FPR of
this baseline method, it is demonstrated how many more patients in the test set would be reached weekly by the proposed method
(owing to its enhanced TPR), alongside the enhancement in the quantity of missed doses detected. To ascertain the number of missed
doses caught, only missed doses that transpired before the patient’s transition to HIGH risk are counted. The model identifies 21.6%
more patients and captures 76.5% more missed doses, signifying substantially more accurate targeting than the baseline.
It is shown that the model also surpasses the baseline as both the true positive rate (TPR) and FPR escalate, underscoring the model’s
superior discriminatory capability. This proves advantageous for interventions not constrained by resources, like calls or texts. It
is important to remember that the screening procedure is not pertinent to this category of intervention; therefore, the predictions
can solely advocate for supplementary interventions. It is crucial that additional interventions are meticulously aimed, as repeated
engagement with a specific patient diminishes the effectiveness of each subsequent interaction over time. This emphasizes the
significance of the enhanced precision provided by the model, as merely inundating the entire population with calls and texts is
probable to be ineffective.
3
The model has the capability to prevent a greater number of missed doses compared to existing approaches. Nonetheless, these
advancements cannot be realized unless health workers on the ground administer interventions in accordance with the predictions.
Consequently, interpretability emerges as a crucial determinant of the model’s utility, as health workers must comprehend the
rationale behind the model’s predictions to trust it and incorporate its logic with their own professional expertise.
The superior predictive performance was attained with LEAP, a black-box network, as opposed to an inherently interpretable model
such as linear regression. As a result, it is demonstrated how a visualization instrument can assist users in extracting insights
regarding the model’s reasoning. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) python library was employed, which produces
visualizations to elucidate machine learning models. It is illustrated how static features affect the model’s prediction, where red
features drive predictions toward 1 (HIGH) and blue toward 0 (MEDIUM). It is important to recall that features are scaled as
percentiles. In the blue region, it is observed that this patient makes an above-average number of calls each week, pushing the
prediction toward 0. Conversely, in the red region, it is noted that this patient has a very low average but a high variability in time
between calls. These features capture that this patient missed two days of calls, then made three calls on one day in an attempt to
""back log"" their previous missed calls. The model learned that this is a high-risk behavior.
Four distinct samples are presented as input to the LSTM layer of the model. On the left, the binary input sequence is depicted as
colored pixels, where black represents a call and yellow signifies a missed call. On the right, SHAP values corresponding to each
day of adherence data are displayed, and grey denotes the commencement of the call sequence. It is observed that the model has
discerned that calls made later in the week carry more weight than those made earlier. In Sample 1, the bottom two pixels (the most
recent calls) have blue SHAP values, while the other pixels have SHAP values close to 0. In Sample 3, a single missed call at the
beginning of the week, combined with a call made at the end of the week, result in essentially canceling SHAP values. Sample 4
also has one missed call, but on the last day of the week, resulting in a net positive SHAP value.
This visualization method offers intuitive insights into the principles acquired by the model. In a real-world application, healthcare
professionals could produce these visualizations for any given sample on-the-fly to support their decision-making procedure.

Conclusion
A framework is introduced for acquiring the ability to generate intervention recommendations from data produced by DAT systems
used in TB care. A comprehensive strategy is formulated for learning from medical adherence data that includes unrecorded
interventions, and this strategy is utilized to construct a model for forecasting risk in various contexts. In the real-time adherence
scenario, it is demonstrated that the model would empower health workers to more precisely direct interventions to high-risk patients
at an earlier stage, identifying 21% more patients and preventing 76% more missed doses than the existing heuristic benchmark.
Subsequently, the model is trained for outcome prediction, illustrating how adherence data can more accurately detect patients
at risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes. Insights are then derived that could assist health workers in accurately identifying
LCFO patients using a straightforward rule after a mere 7 days of treatment. Finally, it is demonstrated that adapting the LEAP
model for a particular intervention through decision-focused learning can enhance performance by an additional 15%. The learning
methodologies presented here are versatile and could be applied to analyze data generated by DATs for any medication schedule.
Given the increasing adoption of DAT systems for TB, HIV, diabetes, heart disease, and other medications, this work aims to
establish the groundwork for enhanced patient outcomes in healthcare settings worldwide.

Outcome Prediction
The subsequent phase involves an investigation into how adherence data can be employed to forecast the ultimate treatment outcome.
Conventional studies on TB treatment typically model outcomes solely in relation to patient covariates, such as demographic
characteristics. By utilizing daily real-time adherence data furnished by DATs, an exploration is conducted into how employing
the initial k days of a patient’s adherence facilitates more precise, individualized outcome predictions. It is important to note
that intervention effects are still discernible in this configuration. Nevertheless, the screening procedure will not be applicable,
as predictions are made over a span of several months, during which practically all patients would have had recurring in-person
interactions with healthcare providers.
The prediction task is formalized in the following manner: given the first k days of adherence data, predict the final binary treatment
outcome. ""Cured"" and ""Treatment Complete"" were regarded as favorable outcomes, while ""Died,"" ""Lost to follow-up,"" and
""Treatment Failure"" were considered unfavorable. Solely patients who were assigned an outcome from these classifications are
incorporated. Furthermore, given that patients with the outcome ""Died"" or ""Lost to follow-up"" exit the program prior to the full 6
months of treatment, those who were present for less than k + 1 days were excluded. Lastly, patients who had in excess of half their
first k days marked as manual doses were omitted. This was inclined to enhance prediction performance, which is conjectured to be
associated with the observation that practices for reporting manual doses varied by health center, rendering the ""significance"" of a
manual dose ambiguous across samples with respect to outcome. The final dataset comprised 4167 samples, with 433 unfavorable
cases.
Through discussions in Mumbai, it was learned that health workers often build a sense of a patient’s risk of an unfavorable outcome
within their first month of treatment. To model this process, k=35 was set for the prediction task, capturing the first month of each
patient’s adherence after enrollment in 99DOTS. (Note that this is not a general rule for health workers, but simply served as a
4
motivation for the choice of k in this task.) Both the static features and the sequence inputs were the same as calculated for the
weekly prediction task, but now taken over the initial 35 days. Two versions of the health worker baseline were included: missed
doses in the last week (lw-Misses) and total missed doses in 35 days (t-Misses).
The same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as before were used. For the Random Forest, 150
trees were used with no maximum depth. For LEAP, 64 hidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 48 units for the dense
layer input, and 4 units in the penultimate dense layer.
Even the rudimentary baseline of tallying the calls made in the preceding 7 days before the 35-day threshold is somewhat predictive
of the outcome, implying that the daily data provided by DATs is valuable in assessing which patients will fail TB treatment. The
ML models exhibit even greater predictive capability, with LEAP leading in performance, closely followed by the random forest.
It is emphasized how LEAP’s predictive ability could aid officials in minimizing the expenses required to meet medical outcome
targets for their city. For instance, suppose Mumbai initiates a new program to capture 80% of unfavorable outcomes (true positives)
by recruiting additional health staff. Across the 17,000 patients in Mumbai, where 10% have unsuccessful outcomes as in the test
set, an 80% capture rate necessitates rescuing 1360 patients. Employing either baseline, attaining the 80% TPR necessitates an FPR
of 70%, which translates to hiring extra staff to support 10710 total patients in this hypothetical scenario. However, utilizing LEAP
only results in an FPR of 42%, corresponding to 6426 total patients. It is important to remember that in Mumbai, the typical health
worker attends to approximately 25 patients. With a yearly starting salary of |216,864, the model would result in |37M in saved costs
annually.
7
Detecting Low-Call Favorable Outcome Patients
An additional significant hurdle within the 99DOTS system is that certain patients consistently take their doses as directed but opt not
to call. Consequently, according to the dashboard, they appear to be missing doses and would be categorized as HIGH risk by both
99DOTS and LEAP. However, in actuality, they should be classified as MEDIUM risk. In fact, almost 15% of patients who had an
outcome assigned as in section 3 called on fewer than 25% of the days during their treatment, yet experienced a favorable outcome.
These patients are referred to as low-call favorable outcome (LCFO). The aim is to learn to recognize these LCFO patients to avoid
incorrectly classifying them as HIGH risk, despite their lack of calls. Additionally, there is a desire to identify these patients early in
their treatment so they can be reassigned to an adherence monitoring method that is more appropriate for them.
This is framed as a binary prediction task as follows: given the first k days of adherence data, predict whether the patient will both
call on less than 25% of days from day k + 1 onward and have a favorable outcome. Only patients who were assigned an outcome as
in Section 3 and who had at least k + 7 days of adherence data were included. To detect LCFO status as early as possible, k was set
to 7. Thus, the final dataset contained 7265 patients, of which 1124 were positive. Note that this population was larger than that of
the outcome prediction task because 1) patients were required to be in the program for less time and 2) patients were not removed
for having too many manual doses since this was found to correlate with being LCFO.
Both the static features and the sequence inputs were the same as calculated for the outcome prediction task, but this time taken over
the initial 7 days. The health worker baseline of missed doses in the last week (lw-Misses) was included, along with a random forest
trained only on demographic or ""0-day"" data (RF 0-day), a simple baseline that counts the number of manual doses in the last week
(lw-Manual), a random forest trained on all non-sequence features over the initial 7 days (RF), and LEAP trained on all features and
sequences.
The same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as the previous two formulations were used. For RF
0-day, 300 trees were used with a maximum depth of 10. For RF, 200 trees were used with a maximum depth of 10. For LEAP, 200
hidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 1000 units for the dense layer input, and 16 units in the penultimate dense layer.
Interestingly, for this task, the lw-Misses baseline has almost no predictive power. Conversely, the performance of the lw-Manual
heuristic is notable, which simply counts the number of manual doses marked in the first 7 days for each patient. This simple
heuristic has almost equivalent predictive power to the machine learning models. This is a valuable insight for health workers,
suggesting that if the worker is already manually marking doses for a patient early in their treatment, the patient is likely to continue
to be disengaged with the system in the long term and should be considered for different adherence technology. The RF 0-day model
has decent predictive power, though closer inspection reveals that most of this power is encoded in the treatment center ID – that is,
LCFO patients tend to be concentrated at certain treatment centers. This insight merits closer inspection by supervisors about why
patients in certain regions tend to be disengaged with 99DOTS but still consuming pills. The RF and LEAP models both perform
slightly better than the lw-Manual baseline but similarly to each other, suggesting that the adherence sequence structure does not
encode additional information for this prediction task. These insights could improve processes by 1) helping to identify hotspot
regions of LCFO patients, after which supervisors might investigate the underlying reason and adjust treatment accordingly at those
centers and 2) the lw-Manual baseline, after only 7 days of dosage data, could give health workers a simple rule for identifying
LCFO patients that should switch to different adherence technology.

Decision Focused Learning
This section delves into a case study illustrating how the LEAP model can be specialized to furnish decision support for a specific
intervention. The end-to-end differentiability of the model is utilized to supplant the earlier loss function (binary cross-entropy)
with a performance metric customized to the objective and limitations of a particular decision problem. To realize this end-to-end
training, recent developments in decision-focused learning are employed, which incorporates an optimization model within the
machine learning training loop.
The focus is on a particular optimization problem that simulates the allocation of health workers to intervene with patients who are
at risk in the near future. This proactive intervention is facilitated by the real-time risk predictions and exemplifies how the system
can empower preemptive, focused action by providers. Nonetheless, it is underscored that the system can be readily adapted to
accommodate other intervention problems. Such adaptability is one of the advantages of the technical approach, which permits the
ML model to automatically adjust to the problem delineated by a domain expert.
The optimization problem models a health worker who orchestrates a sequence of interventions throughout a week. The health
worker is accountable for a patient population across various locations and may visit one location daily. Location identifiers are
employed at the TB Unit level, as this is the most detailed identifier shared by the majority of patients in the dataset. Visiting a
location enables the health worker to intervene with any of the patients at that location. The optimization problem involves choosing
a set of locations to visit that maximizes the number of patients who receive an intervention on or before the first day they would
have missed a dose. This quantity is referred to as the number of successful interventions, which is selected as the objective for two
rationales. Firstly, it gauges the degree to which the health worker can proactively engage with patients before adherence declines.
Secondly, this objective exclusively counts patients who commence the week at MEDIUM attention and receive an intervention
before they could have transitioned to HIGH, aligning with the earlier discussion on circumventing unobserved interventions in the
data. This extends the earlier intervention proxy to manage day-by-day rewards.
The optimization problem can be formalized as a linear program. There is a set of locations i = 1, . . . , L and patients j = 1, . . . , N,
where patient j has location ℓj. Over the days of the week t = 1, . . . , 7, the objective coefficient cjt is 1 if an intervention on day t
with patient j is successful and 0 otherwise. The decision variable is xit, which takes the value 1 if the health worker visits location
i on day t and 0 otherwise. With this notation, the final LP is as follows:
max

t=1
N
X
j=1
cjtxℓj,t
subject to:
7

t=1
xit ≤1
∀i,
xit ∈{0, 1}.
Here, the second constraint prevents the objective from double-counting multiple visits to a location. It is noted that the feasible
region of the LP can be demonstrated to be equivalent to a bipartite matching polytope, implying that the optimal solution is always
integral.
The machine learning task involves predicting the values of cjt, which are unknown at the start of the week. Three models are
compared. Firstly, the lw-Misses baseline is extended to this setting by thresholding the number of doses patient j missed in the last
week, setting cjt = 0 for all t if this value falls below the threshold τ and cjt = 1 otherwise. τ = 1 was used as it performed best.
Secondly, the LEAP system was trained directly on the true cjt as a binary prediction task using cross-entropy loss. Thirdly, LEAP
was trained to predict cjt using performance on the above optimization problem as the loss function (training via the differentiable
surrogate). This model is referred to as LEAP-Decision.
Instances of the decision problem were created by randomly dividing patients into groups of 100, simulating a health worker under
severe resource limitations (as they would benefit most from such a system). All patients were included, even those with no missed
doses in the last week, since the overall resource allocation problem over locations must still account for them.
LEAP and LEAP-Decision both outperform lw-Misses, as anticipated. LEAP-Decision enhances the number of successful
interventions by roughly 15% compared to LEAP, showcasing the merit of customizing the learned model to a given planning
problem. LEAP-Decision actually has a lower AUC than either LEAP or lw-Misses, suggesting that conventional measures of
machine learning accuracy are not an ideal proxy for utility in decision-making. To investigate what specifically distinguishes the
predictions made by LEAP-Decision, scatter plots of the predicted utility at each location according to LEAP and LEAP-Decision
versus the true values are presented. Visually, LEAP-Decision appears better able to distinguish the high-utility outliers which are
most important to making good decisions. Quantitatively, LEAP-Decision’s predictions have worse correlation with the ground truth
overall (0.463, versus 0.519 for LEAP), but better correlation on locations where the true utility is strictly more than 1 (0.504 versus
0.409). Hence, decision-focused training incentivizes the model to focus on making accurate predictions specifically for locations
that are likely to be good candidates for an intervention. This demonstrates the benefit of the flexible machine learning modeling
approach, which can use custom-defined loss functions to automatically adapt to particular decision problems.

P111.pdf,"Leveraging Deep Learning for Enhanced Bayesian Optimization in
Scientific Domains with Complex Structures
Abstract
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used technique for the global optimization of costly black-box functions.
However, many real-world scenarios involve functions that are not entirely black-box. These functions may possess
known structures, such as symmetries, or the data generation process might be a composite one that provides
valuable intermediate information beyond the optimization objective’s value. Traditional surrogate models used
in BO, like Gaussian Processes (GPs), do not scale well with large datasets and struggle to incorporate known
structures. This paper introduces the use of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which are scalable and adaptable
surrogate models with inductive biases, to enhance BO for intricate, structured problems in high-dimensional
spaces. We showcase the application of BO on various practical challenges in physics and chemistry. This includes
optimizing the topology of photonic crystal materials using convolutional neural networks and refining chemical
properties of molecules with graph neural networks. Our findings indicate that neural networks frequently surpass
GPs as surrogate models for BO in these complex tasks, achieving greater sampling efficiency and reduced
computational expenses.

Introduction
Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful technique for global optimization, particularly suited for expensive, derivative-free
functions. It has found applications across various scientific and engineering domains, including hyperparameter tuning in machine
learning. BO operates by iteratively selecting the next data point to evaluate, aiming to maximize sampling efficiency and minimize
the number of evaluations needed to find the optimum. This is crucial when experiments or simulations are time-consuming or
resource-intensive.
In numerous fields, the system under investigation is not a complete black box. For instance, high-dimensional input spaces like
images or molecules often exhibit known structures, symmetries, and invariances. Moreover, the function might be decomposable
into other functions, where the data collection process yields intermediate or auxiliary information that can be used to compute
the objective function more efficiently. Examples include scientific experiments or simulations that produce high-dimensional
observations or multiple measurements simultaneously, such as the optical scattering spectrum of a nanoparticle across various
wavelengths or multiple quantum chemistry properties of a molecule from a single density functional theory (DFT) calculation.
These physically-informed insights into the system are valuable for designing surrogate models with appropriate inductive biases,
but they are often underutilized in current methods.
BO relies on a surrogate model to represent a distribution over potential functions, incorporating uncertainty in its predictions.
Gaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as surrogate models due to their analytical tractability. However, GPs face challenges:
(1) their inference time scales cubically with the number of observations and output dimensionality, making them less suitable for
large datasets or problems with high output dimensionality without kernel approximations, and (2) they are most naturally applied to
continuous, low-dimensional input spaces, requiring careful manual formulation of kernels for high-dimensional data with complex
structures. Consequently, encoding inductive biases can be difficult.
Neural networks (NNs) and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as alternatives to GPs due to their scalability and
flexibility. Another approach involves using neural networks to generate continuous latent spaces, making it easier to apply BO
with standard GPs. The ability of BNN architectures to incorporate various constraints, symmetries, and inductive biases opens up
possibilities for applying BO to more complex tasks involving structured data.
This work demonstrates the application of deep learning to facilitate BO for complex, real-world scientific datasets, without relying
on pre-trained models. Specifically:
• We utilize auxiliary or intermediate information to enhance BO for tasks with high-dimensional observations.
• We apply BO to complex input spaces, including images and molecules, using convolutional and graph neural networks,
respectively.
• We implement BO on several realistic scientific datasets, such as the optical scattering of a nanoparticle, topology
optimization of a photonic crystal material, and chemical property optimization of molecules from the QM9 dataset.
Our results demonstrate that neural networks can significantly outperform GPs as surrogate models on these problems. We believe
these strong results will generalize to other contexts, enabling the application of BO to a wider range of problems. While our
methods build upon existing techniques, we employ a novel combination of these methods to adapt existing BO frameworks to
real-world, complex applications.

Related Work
Several methods have been developed to improve the scalability of GPs for larger problems. For example, one framework for
multi-output GPs scales linearly with the dimensionality of a low-dimensional subspace of the data. Multi-task GPs have also been
used for BO over problems with large output dimensionalities. Furthermore, GPs have been demonstrated on very large datasets
using GPUs and intelligent preconditioners, or through various approximations.
Another strategy for scaling BO to larger problems involves combining it with other methods, reducing the need for the surrogate
model to train on the entire dataset. For instance, one method uses a collection of independent probabilistic models in different trust
regions, iteratively deciding where to perform BO, effectively reducing the problem to a set of local optimizations. Other methods
build upon this approach and dynamically learn the partition function separating different regions.
GPs have been adapted to complex problem settings to broaden the applicability of BO. For example, some approaches decompose
synthetic problems as a composition of other functions, leveraging the additional structure to improve BO. However, the multi-output
GP used in these approaches scales poorly with output dimensionality, limiting their use to simpler problems. GP kernels have also
been developed for complex input spaces, including convolutional and graph kernels. Graph kernels have been used to apply BO to
neural architecture search (NAS), where the architecture and connectivity of a neural network itself can be optimized.
Deep learning has been employed as a scalable and flexible surrogate model for BO. For instance, neural networks have been used
as adaptive basis functions for Bayesian linear regression, enabling BO to scale to large datasets. This approach also allows for
transfer learning of the adaptive basis across multiple tasks and modeling of auxiliary signals to improve performance. Additionally,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample the posterior have been used for single-task and
multi-task BO for hyperparameter optimization.
A popular approach for BO in high-dimensional spaces is latent-space optimization. Here, an autoencoder, such as a VAE, is trained
on a dataset to create a continuous latent space representing the data. Then, conventional optimization algorithms, like BO with GPs,
can be used to optimize over this continuous latent space. This approach has been applied to tasks such as arithmetic expression
optimization and chemical design. Note that these approaches focus on both data generation and optimization, whereas our work
focuses solely on the optimization process.
Random forests have also been used for iterative optimization, such as sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC), as
they do not face scaling challenges. Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) are another popular choice for hyperparameter tuning.
However, these approaches still encounter difficulties in encoding complex, structured inputs like images and graphs.
Deep learning has also been applied to improve tasks other than BO. For example, active learning, similar to BO, aims to optimize a
model’s predictive ability with as few data points as possible. The inductive biases of neural networks have enabled active learning
on various high-dimensional data, including images, language, and partial differential equations. BNNs have also been applied to the
contextual bandits problem, where the model chooses between discrete actions to maximize expected reward.

Methodology
3.1
Bayesian Optimization Prerequisites
We will now briefly introduce the BO methodology. We formulate our optimization task as a maximization problem, where we
aim to find the input x˘2217 ˘2208 X that maximizes a function f, such that x˘2217 = arg maxx f(x). The input x can be a real-valued
continuous vector, but it can also be generalized to categorical variables, images, or discrete objects like molecules. The function f
returns the objective value y = f(x), which we also refer to as the ""label"" of x, and can represent a performance metric we want to
maximize. In general, f can be a noisy function.
A crucial component of BO is the surrogate model, which provides a distribution of predictions instead of a single point estimate.
Ideally, these surrogate models are Bayesian, but in practice, various approximate Bayesian models or even frequentist distributions
have been used. In iteration N, a Bayesian surrogate model M is trained on a labeled dataset Dtrain = (xn, yn)N n=1. An acquisition
function ˘03b1 then uses M to suggest the next data point xN+1 ˘2208 X to label, where:
xN+1 = arg max
x∈X α(x; M, Dtrain)
(1)
2
The new data is evaluated to obtain yN+1 = f(xN+1), and (xN+1, yN+1) is added to Dtrain.
3.2
Acquisition Function
A key consideration in BO is selecting the next data point xN+1 ˘2208 X given the model M and labeled dataset Dtrain. This is
parameterized through the acquisition function ˘03b1, which is maximized to determine the next data point to label, as shown in
Equation 1.
We utilize the expected improvement (EI) acquisition function ˘03b1EI. When the posterior predictive distribution of the surrogate
model M is a normal distribution N(˘00b5(x), ˘03c32(x)), EI can be expressed analytically as:
αEI(x) = σ(x)[γ(x)Φ(γ(x)) + ϕ(γ(x))]
(2)
where ˘03b3(x) = (˘00b5(x) ˘2212 ybest)/˘03c3(x), ybest = max(ynN n=1) is the best observed objective function value so far, and ˘03c6
and ˘03a6 are the PDF and CDF of the standard normal distribution N(0, 1), respectively. For surrogate models without an analytical
form for the posterior predictive distribution, we sample from the posterior NMC times and use a Monte Carlo (MC) approximation
of EI:
αMC
EI (x) ≈
1
NMC
NMC
X
i=1
max(µ(i)(x) −ybest, 0)
(3)
where ˘00b5(i) is a prediction sampled from the posterior of M. While some works fit the surrogate model’s output to a Gaussian to
use Equation 2 for acquisition, this is not valid when the model prediction for y is not Gaussian, which is generally the case for
composite functions (see Section 2.4).
EI has advantages over other acquisition functions because the MC approximation (1) remains differentiable, facilitating optimization
of the acquisition function in the inner loop (unlike the MC approximation of upper confidence bound (UCB), which is not
differentiable and can result in ties), and (2) is inexpensive (unlike naive Thompson sampling for ensembles, which would require
retraining a model from scratch in each iteration).
3.3
Continued Training with Learning Rate Annealing
A challenge in BO is the computational cost of training a surrogate model on Dtrain from scratch in every optimization loop,
especially since neural networks ideally require extensive training until convergence. To reduce the training time of BNNs in each
optimization loop, we use the model trained in the Nth optimization loop iteration as the initialization (a ""warm start"") for the
(N+1)th iteration, rather than starting from a random initialization. Specifically, we employ the cosine annealing learning rate, which
starts with a high learning rate and gradually reduces it to 0. For more details, refer to Section A.3 in the Appendix.
3.4
Auxiliary Information
Typically, we assume f is a black-box function, so we train M : X ˘2192 Y to model f. Here, we consider scenarios where the
experiment or observation may provide intermediate or auxiliary information z ˘2208 Z, such that f can be decomposed as:
f(x) = h(g(x))
(4)
where g : X ˘2192 Z is the expensive labeling process, and h : Z ˘2192 Y is a known objective function that can be computed cheaply.
This is also known as ""composite functions"". In this case, we train M : X ˘2192 Z to model g, and the approximate EI acquisition
function becomes:
αMC−aux
EI
(x) ≈
1
NMC
NMC
X
i=1
max(h(µ(i)(x)) −ybest, 0)
(5)
which can be seen as a Monte Carlo version of the acquisition function presented in prior work. We denote models trained using
auxiliary information with the suffix ""-aux."" Because h is not necessarily linear, h(˘00b5(i)(x)) is not generally Gaussian even if
˘00b5(i) itself may be, making the MC approximation convenient or even necessary.

Surrogate Models
Bayesian models capture uncertainty associated with both data and model parameters in the form of probability distributions. This
is achieved by placing a prior probability distribution P(˘03b8) on the model parameters and calculating the posterior belief of the
parameters using Bayes’ theorem after observing new data. Fully Bayesian neural networks have been studied in small architectures
but are impractical for realistically sized neural networks, as nonlinearities between layers make the posterior intractable, requiring
MCMC methods to sample the posterior. However, in the last decade, numerous proposals for approximate Bayesian neural networks
have emerged, capable of capturing some Bayesian properties and producing a predictive probability distribution. In this work, we
compare several different options for the BNN surrogate model, along with other non-BNN baselines. We list some notable models
here, with model details and results in Section A.4.1 of the Appendix.
Ensembles combine multiple models to improve predictive performance by averaging their results. Ensembles of neural networks
have been reported to be more robust than other BNNs, and we use ""Ensemble"" to denote an ensemble of neural networks with
identical architectures but different random initializations, providing enough variation for individual models to give different
predictions. Using individual models can be interpreted as sampling from a posterior distribution, so we use Equation 5 for
acquisition. Our ensemble size is NMC = 10.
Other BNNs: We also compare to variational BNNs, including Bayes by Backprop (BBB) and Multiplicative Normalizing Flows
(MNF); BOHAMIANN; and NeuralLinear. For BBB, we also experiment with KL annealing, denoted by ""-Anneal.""
GP Baselines: GPs are largely defined by their kernel (also called ""covariance functions""), which determines the prior and posterior
distributions, how different data points relate to each other, and the type of data the GP can operate on. In this work, ""GP"" refers
to a standard specification using a Mat˘00e9rn 5/2 kernel, a popular kernel for real-valued continuous spaces. For images, we use
a convolutional kernel, labeled as ""ConvGP"", implemented using the infinite-width limit of a convolutional neural network. For
graphs, we use the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel, labeled as ""GraphGP"", which can operate on undirected graphs with node and
edge features, making it suitable for chemical molecule graphs. We also compare against ""GP-aux,"" which uses multi-output GPs
for problems with auxiliary information (composite functions). In the Appendix, we also examine GPs using infinite-width and
infinite-ensemble neural network limits as kernels, as well as TuRBO, which combines GP-based BO with trust regions.
VAE-GP uses a VAE trained beforehand on an unlabeled dataset representative of X. This allows us to encode complex input spaces,
such as chemical molecules, into a continuous latent space where conventional GP-based BO methods can be applied, even enabling
the generation and discovery of novel molecules not in the original dataset. Here, we modified an existing implementation that uses
a junction tree VAE (JTVAE) to encode chemical molecules. More details can be found in the Appendix.
Other Baselines: We compare against two variations of Bayesian optimization, TuRBO and TPE. We also compare against several
global optimization algorithms that do not use surrogate models and are computationally inexpensive, including LIPO, DIRECT-L,
and CMA-ES.
We emphasize that ensembles and variational methods can easily scale to high-dimensional outputs with minimal increase in
computational cost by simply changing the output layer size. Neural Linear and GPs scale cubically with output dimensionality
(without covariance approximations), making them difficult to train on high-dimensional auxiliary or intermediate information.

Results
We now examine three real-world scientific optimization tasks, all of which provide intermediate or auxiliary information that can be
leveraged. In the latter two tasks, the structure of the data also becomes important, and hence BNNs with various inductive biases
significantly outperform GPs and other baselines. For simplicity, we highlight results from select architectures (see Appendix for
full results, dataset, and hyperparameter details). All BO results are averaged over multiple trials, and the shaded area in the plots
represents ˘00b1 one standard error over the trials.
5.1
Multilayer Nanoparticle
We first consider the problem of light scattering from a multilayer nanoparticle, which has various applications requiring a tailored
optical response, including biological imaging, improved solar cell efficiency, and catalytic materials. The nanoparticle we consider
consists of a lossless silica core and 5 spherical shells of alternating TiO2 and silica. The nanoparticle is parameterized by the core
radius and layer thicknesses, which we restrict to the range of 30 nm to 70 nm. Due to the nanoparticle’s size being on the order of
the wavelength of light, its optical properties can be tuned by adjusting the number and thicknesses of the layers. The scattering
spectrum can be calculated semi-analytically, as detailed in Section A.1.1 of the Appendix.
Our goal is to optimize the scattering cross-section spectrum over a range of visible wavelengths. We compare two different objective
functions: the narrowband objective, which aims to maximize scattering in the small wavelength range of 600 nm to 640 nm and
minimize it elsewhere, and the highpass objective, which aims to maximize scattering above 600 nm and minimize it elsewhere.
While conventional GPs are trained using the objective function as the label directly, BNNs with auxiliary information can be trained
to predict the full scattering spectrum (the auxiliary information z ˘2208 R201), which is then used to calculate the objective function.
4
The BO results are presented in Figure 2. The addition of auxiliary information significantly improves BO performance for BNNs.
They are also competitive with GPs, making BNNs a viable approach for scaling BO to large datasets. In Appendix A.5, we observe
similar trends for other types of BNNs. Due to the poor scaling of multi-output GPs with respect to output dimensionality, we can
only run GP-aux for a limited number of iterations within a reasonable time frame. Within these few iterations, GP-aux performs
poorly, only slightly better than random sampling. We also find in the Appendix that BO with either GPs or BNNs is comparable
with or outperforms other global optimization algorithms, including DIRECT-L and CMA-ES.
5.2
Photonic Crystal Topology
Next, we examine a more complex, high-dimensional domain with symmetries that are not easily exploited by GPs. Photonic
crystals (PCs) are nanostructured materials engineered to exhibit unique optical properties not found in bulk materials, such as
photonic band gaps, negative refractive index, and angular selective transparency. With advancements in fabrication techniques
enabling smaller feature sizes, there is growing interest in inverse design and topology optimization to design more sophisticated
PCs for applications in photonic integrated circuits, flat lenses, and sensors.
Here, we consider 2D PCs consisting of periodic unit cells represented by a 32 ˘00d7 32 pixel image, with white and black regions
representing vacuum (or air) and silicon, respectively. Optimizing over raw pixel values may lead to pixel-sized features or
intermediate pixel values that are not physically realizable. Therefore, we parameterize the PCs with a level-set function ˘03c6 : X
˘2192 V that converts a 51-dimensional feature vector x = [c1, c2, ..., c50, ˘2206] ˘2208 R51, representing the level-set parameters, into
an image v ˘2208 R32˘00d732 representing the PC. More details can be found in Section A.1.2 of the Appendix.
We test BO on two different data distributions, PC-A and PC-B. In the PC-A distribution, x spans ci ˘2208 [˘22121, 1], ˘2206 ˘2208
[˘22123, 3]. In the PC-B distribution, we arbitrarily restrict the domain to ci ˘2208 [0, 1]. The PC-A data distribution is translation
invariant, meaning that any PC with a translational shift will also be in the data distribution. However, the PC-B data distribution is
not translation invariant.
The optical properties of PCs can be characterized by their photonic density of states (DOS). We choose an objective function that
aims to minimize the DOS in a certain frequency range while maximizing it elsewhere, corresponding to opening up a photonic band
gap in that frequency range. We train GPs directly on the level-set parameters X, whereas we train the Bayesian convolutional NNs
(BCNNs) on the more natural unit cell image space V. BCNNs can also be trained to predict the full DOS as auxiliary information z
˘2208 R500.
The BO results, shown in Figure 4(a), demonstrate that BCNNs outperform GPs by a significant margin on both datasets. This
is due to both the auxiliary information and the inductive bias of the convolutional layers, as shown in Figure 4(b). Because the
behavior of PCs is determined by their topology rather than individual pixel values or level-set parameters, BCNNs are much better
suited to analyze this dataset compared to GPs. Additionally, BCNNs can be made much more data-efficient since they directly
encode translation invariance and thus learn the behavior of a whole class of translated images from a single image. Because
GP-aux is extremely expensive compared to GP (500˘00d7 longer on this dataset), we are only able to run GP-aux for a small
number of iterations, where it performs comparably to random sampling. We also compare to GPs using a convolutional kernel
(˘201cConvGP-NNGP˘201d) in Figure 4(a). ConvGP-NNGP only performs slightly better than random sampling, likely due to a lack
of auxiliary information and inflexibility to learn the most suitable representation for this dataset.
For our main experiments with BCNNs, we use an architecture that respects translation invariance. To demonstrate the effect
of another commonly used deep learning training technique, we also experiment with incorporating translation invariance into a
translation-dependent architecture using a data augmentation scheme in which each image is randomly translated, flipped, and
rotated during training. We expect data augmentation to improve performance when the data distribution exhibits the corresponding
symmetries. As shown in Figure 4(c), we indeed find that data augmentation improves the BO performance of the translation-
dependent architecture when trained on the translation-invariant PC-A dataset, even matching the performance of a translation-
invariant architecture on PC-A. However, on the translation-dependent PC-B dataset, data augmentation initially hurts the BO
performance of the translation-dependent architecture because the model is unable to quickly specialize to the more compact
distribution of PC-B, putting its BO performance more on par with models trained on PC-A. These results show that techniques used
to improve generalization performance (such as data augmentation or invariant architectures) for training deep learning architectures
can also be applied to BO surrogate models and, when used appropriately, directly translate into improved BO performance. Note
that data augmentation would not be feasible for GPs without a hand-crafted kernel, as the increased size of the dataset would cause
inference to become computationally intractable.
5.3
Organic Molecule Quantum Chemistry
Finally, we optimize the chemical properties of molecules. Chemical optimization is of significant interest in both academia and
industry, with applications in drug design and materials optimization. This is a difficult problem where computational approaches
such as density functional theory (DFT) can take days for simple molecules and are intractable for larger molecules; synthesis is
expensive and time-consuming, and the space of synthesizable molecules is large and complex. There have been many approaches
to molecular optimization that largely revolve around finding a continuous latent space of molecules or hand-crafting kernels to
operate on molecules.
5
Here, we focus on the QM9 dataset, which consists of 133,885 small organic molecules along with their geometric, electronic,
and thermodynamic quantities calculated with DFT. Instead of optimizing over a continuous space, we draw from the fixed pool
of available molecules and iteratively select the next molecule to add to Dtrain. This is a problem setting especially common to
materials design, where databases are incomplete and the space of experimentally feasible materials is small.
We use a Bayesian graph neural network (BGNN) for our surrogate model, as GNNs have become popular for chemistry applications
due to the natural encoding of a molecule as a graph with atoms and bonds as nodes and edges, respectively. For baselines that
operate over continuous spaces (i.e., GPs and simple neural networks), we use the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)
descriptor to produce a fixed-length feature vector for each molecule.
We compare two different optimization objectives derived from the QM9 dataset: the isotropic polarizability ˘03b1 and (˘03b5LUMO
˘2212 ˘20acg„) where ˘20acg,;, is the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Other objectives are included in the Appendix. Because many of the
chemical properties in the QM9 dataset can be collectively computed by a single DFT or molecular dynamics calculation, we can
treat a group of labels from QM9 as auxiliary information z and train our BGNN to predict this entire group simultaneously. The
objective function h then simply picks out the property of interest.
As shown in Figure 5(c), GraphGP and the BGNN variants significantly outperform GPs, showing that the inductive bias in the graph
structure leads to a much more natural representation of the molecule and its properties. In the case of maximizing the polarizability
˘03b1, including the auxiliary information improves BO performance, showing signs of positive transfer. However, it does not have a
significant impact on the other objectives, which may be due to the small size of the available auxiliary information (only a handful
of chemical properties from the QM dataset) compared with the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. In a more realistic online
setting, we would have significantly more physically informative information available from a DFT calculation, e.g., we could easily
compute the electronic density of states (the electronic analogue of the auxiliary information used in the photonics task).
As seen in Figure 5(d), we also note that the GraphGP is relatively computationally expensive (15˘00d7 longer than GPs for small N
and 800˘00d7 longer than BGNNs for N = 100) and so we are only able to run it for a limited N in a reasonable time frame. We see
that BGNNs perform comparably or better than GraphGPs despite incurring a fraction of the computational cost.
VAE-GP uses a modified version of the latent-space optimization method implementation provided by Tripp et al. (2020). Rather
than optimizing over a continuous latent space of the VAE, we feed the data pool through the VAE encoder to find their latent space
representation and then apply the acquisition function to the latent points to pick out the best unlabeled point to sample. We keep as
many hyperparameters the same as the original implementation as possible, except for the weighted retraining, which we forgo
since we have a fixed data pool that was used to train the VAE. This setup is similar to GraphNeuralLinear in that a deep learning
architecture is used to encode the molecule as a continuous vector, although GraphNeuralLinear is only trained on the labeled data.
The results for this experiment show that VAE-GP performs worse than BNNs on two of the three objective functions we tested and
slightly better on one objective. We also note that the performance of VAE-GP depends very heavily on the pre-training of the VAE,
as choosing different hyperparameters or even a different random seed can significantly deteriorate performance (see Figure 15 in
the Appendix).

Discussion
Introducing physics-informed priors (in the form of inductive biases) into the model is critical for performance. Well-known
inductive biases in deep learning include convolutional and graph neural networks for images and graph structures, respectively,
which significantly improve BO performance. Another inductive bias we introduce is the addition of auxiliary information present
in composite functions, which significantly improves the performance of BO for the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. We
conjecture that the additional information forces the BNN to learn a more consistent physical model of the system since it must
learn features shared across the multi-dimensional auxiliary information, thus enabling the BNN to generalize better. For example,
the scattering spectrum of the multilayer particle consists of multiple resonances (sharp peaks), the width and location of which
are determined by the material properties and layer thicknesses. The BNN could potentially learn these more abstract features,
and thus the deeper physics, to help it interpolate more efficiently, akin to data augmentation. Auxiliary information can also be
interpreted as a form of data augmentation. Indeed, tracking the prediction error on a validation set shows that models with auxiliary
information tend to have a lower loss than those without (see Appendix A.5). It is also possible that the loss landscape for the
auxiliary information is smoother than that of the objective function and that the auxiliary information acts as implicit regularization
that improves generalization performance.
Interestingly, GP-aux performs extremely poorly on the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. One possible reason is that we are
only able to run GP-aux for a few iterations, and it is not uncommon for GP-based BO to require some critical number of iterations
to reach convergence, especially in high-dimensional systems where the size of the covariance matrix scales with the square of the
dimensionality. It may also be possible that GP-aux only works on certain types of function decompositions and cannot be broadly
applied to all composite functions, as the inductive biases in GPs are often hard-coded.
There is an interesting connection between how well BNNs are able to capture and explore a multi-modal posterior distribution and
their performance in BO. For example, we have noticed that larger batch sizes tend to significantly hurt BO performance. On the one
hand, larger batch sizes may result in poorer generalization as the model finds sharper local minima in the loss landscape. Another
explanation is that the stochasticity inherent in smaller batch sizes allows the BNN to more easily explore the posterior distribution,
6
which is known to be highly multi-modal. Indeed, BO often underperforms for very small dataset sizes N but quickly catches up as
N increases, indicating that batch size is an important hyperparameter that must be balanced with computational cost.
All our results use continued training (or warm restart) to minimize training costs. We note that re-initializing M and training from
scratch in every iteration performs better than continued training on some tasks (results in the Appendix), which points to how BNNs
may not sufficiently represent a multi-modal posterior distribution or that continued training may skew the training distribution that
the BNN sees. Future work will consider using stochastic training approaches such as SG-MCMC methods for exploring posterior
distributions, as well as other continual learning techniques to further minimize training costs, especially for larger datasets.
When comparing BNN architectures, we find that ensembles tend to consistently perform among the best, which is supported by
previous literature showing that ensembles capture uncertainty much better than variational methods, especially in multi-modal loss
landscapes. Ensembles are also attractive because they require no additional hyperparameters and are simple to implement. Although
training costs increase linearly with the size of the ensemble, this can be easily parallelized on modern computing infrastructures.
Furthermore, recent work that aims to model efficient ensembles that minimize computational cost could be an interesting future
direction. NeuralLinear variants are also quite powerful and cheap, making them very promising for tasks without high-dimensional
auxiliary information. Integrating Neural Linear with multi-output GPs is an interesting direction for future work. The other BNNs
either require extensive hyperparameter tuning or perform poorly, making them difficult to use in practice. Additional discussion can
be found in Appendix A.5.5.
As seen in Appendix A.5.4, VAE-GP performs worse than our method on two of the chemistry objectives and better on one objective.
While latent-space optimization methods are often applied to domains where one wants to simultaneously generate data and optimize
over the data distribution, these methods can also be applied to the cases in this work, where a data pool (e.g., QM9 dataset for
the chemistry task) or separate data generation process (e.g., level-set process for the photonic crystal task) is already available. In
these cases, the VAE is not used as a generative model but rather as a way to learn appropriate representations. While latent-space
approaches can take advantage of well-developed and widely available optimization algorithms, they also require unsupervised
pre-training on a sizable dataset and a suitable autoencoder model with the necessary inductive biases. Such models are available in
chemistry, where there has been significant development, but are more limited in other domains such as photonics. On the other
hand, our method can incorporate the data structure or domain knowledge in an end-to-end manner during training, although future
work is needed to evaluate more carefully how much of an advantage this is and whether it depends on specific dataset or domain
characteristics. For settings where we do not need a generative model, it would also be interesting to replace the autoencoder with a
self-supervised model or semi-supervised model to create a suitable latent space.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated global optimization on multiple tasks using a combination of deep learning and BO. In particular, we have
shown how BNNs can be used as surrogate models in BO, enabling the scaling of BO to large datasets and providing the flexibility to
incorporate a wide variety of constraints, data augmentation techniques, and inductive biases. We have demonstrated that integrating
domain knowledge on the structure and symmetries of the data into the surrogate model, as well as exploiting intermediate or
auxiliary information, significantly improves BO performance, all of which can be interpreted as physics-informed priors. Intuitively,
providing the BNN surrogate model with all available information allows the BNN to learn a more faithful physical model of the
system of interest, thus enhancing the performance of BO. Finally, we have applied BO to real-world, high-dimensional scientific
datasets, and our results show that BNNs can outperform our best-effort GPs, even with strong domain-dependent structure encoded
in the covariance functions. We note that our method is not necessarily tied to any particular application domain and can lower the
barrier of entry for design and optimization.
Future work will investigate more complex BNN architectures with stronger inductive biases. For example, output constraints can be
placed through unsupervised learning or by variationally fitting a BNN prior. Custom architectures have also been proposed for
partial differential equations, many-body systems, and generalized symmetries, which will enable effective BO on a wider range of
tasks. The methods and experiments presented here enable BO to be effectively applied in a wider variety of settings. There are also
variants of BO, including TuRBO, which perform extremely well on our tasks, and so future work will also include incorporating
BNNs into these variants.

Datasets
The dimensionalities of the datasets are summarized in Table 1. The continuous input dimension for chemical molecules refers
to the SOAP descriptor. While the space of chemical molecule graphs in general does not have a well-defined dimensionality as
chemical molecules can be arbitrarily large and complex, we limit the size of molecules by only sampling from the QM9 dataset,
and can define the dimensionality as the sum of the adjacency, node, and edge matrix dimensionalities.
The high dimensionalities of all of these problems make Bayesian neural networks well-suited as surrogate models to enable scaling.
Note that the nanoparticle scattering problem can be adjusted to be less or more difficult by either changing the input dimensionality
(i.e. the number of nanoparticle layers) or the auxiliary dimension (i.e. the resolution or range of wavelengths that are sampled).

Nanoparticle Scattering
The multilayer nanoparticle consists of a lossless silica core surrounded by alternating spherical layers of lossless TiO2 and lossless
silica. The relative permittivity of silica is ˘03b5silica = 2.04. The relative permittivity of TiO2 is dispersive and depends on the
wavelength of light:
εT iO2 = 5.913 +
0.2441
λ2 −0.0803
(6)
where ˘03bb is the wavelength given in units of nm. The entire particle is surrounded by water, which has a relative permittivity of
˘03b5water = 1.77.
For a given set of thicknesses, we analytically solve for the scattering spectrum, i.e. the scattering cross-section ˘03c3(˘03bb) as a
function of wavelength ˘03bb, using Mie scattering. The code for computing ˘03c3 was adapted from existing work.
The objective functions for the narrowband and highpass objectives are:

Photonic Crystal
The photonic crystal (PC) consists of periodic unit cells with periodicity a = 1 au, where each unit cell is depicted as a ˘201ctwo-
tone˘201d image, with the white regions representing silicon with permittivity ˘03b51 = 11.4 and black regions representing vacuum
(or air) with permittivity ˘03b50 = 1.
The photonic crystal (PC) structure is defined by a spatially varying permittivity ˘03b5(x, y) ˘2208 ˘03b50, ˘03b51 over a 2D periodic
unit cell with spatial coordinates x, y ˘2208 [0, a]. To parameterize ˘03b5, we choose a level set of a Fourier sum function ˘03c6,
defined as a linear combination of plane waves with frequencies evenly spaced in the reciprocal lattice space up to a maximum cutoff.
Intuitively, the upper limit on the frequencies roughly corresponds to a lower limit on the feature size such that the photonic crystal
remains within reasonable fabrication constraints. Here we set the cutoff such that there are 25 complex frequencies corresponding
to 50 real coefficients c = (c1, c2, ..., c50).
Explicitly, we have
ϕ[c](x, y) = ℜ
 25
X
k=1
(ck + ick+25)e2πi(nxx+nyy)/a
!
(9)
where each exponential term is composed from the 25 different pairs nx, ny with nx, ny ˘2208 ˘22122, ˘22121, 0, 1, 2. We then choose
a level-set offset ˘2206 to determine the PC structure, where regions with ˘03c6 > ˘2206 are assigned to be silicon and regions where
˘03c6 ˘2264 ˘2206 are vacuum. Thus, the photonic crystal unit cell topology is parameterized by a 51-dimensional vector, [c1, c2, ...,
c50, ˘2206] ˘2208 R51. More specifically,
ε(x, y) = ε[c, ∆](x, y) = { ε 1 ϕ[c](x, y) > ∆ε0ϕ[c](x, y) ≤∆
(10)
8
which is discretized to result in a 32 ˘00d7 32 pixel image v ˘2208 ˘03b50, ˘03b5132˘00d732. This formulation also has the advantage of
enforcing periodic boundary conditions.
For each unit cell, we use the MIT Photonics Bands (MPB) software to compute the band structure of the photonic crystal, ˘03c9(k),
up to the lowest 10 bands, using a 32 ˘00d7 32 spatial resolution (or equivalently, 32 ˘00d7 32 k-points over the Brillouin zone
˘2212 ˘03c0 a < k < ˘03c0 a ). We also extract the group velocities at each k-point and compute the density-of-states (DOS) via an
extrapolative technique. The DOS is computed at a resolution of 20,000 points, and a Gaussian filter of kernel size 100 is used to
smooth the DOS spectrum. To normalize the frequency scale across the different unit cells, the frequency is rescaled via ˘03c9 ˘2192
˘03c9norm, where ˘03b5avg is the average permittivity over all pixels. Finally, the DOS spectrum is truncated at ˘03c9norm = 1.2 and
interpolated using 500 points to give z ˘2208 R500.
The objective function aims to minimize the DOS in a small frequency range and maximize it elsewhere. We use the following:
hDOS(z) =
300
X
i=1
zi +
1
P500
i=351 zi + 1
(11)
where the 1 is added in the denominator to avoid singular values.

Organic Molecule Quantum Chemistry
The Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor uses smoothed atomic densities to describe local environments for each
atom in the molecule through a fixed-length feature vector, which can then be averaged over all the atoms in the molecule to produce
a fixed-length feature vector for the molecule. This descriptor is invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations. We use the
SOAP descriptor implemented by DScribe using the parameters: local cutoff rcut = 5, number of radial basis functions nmax =
3, and maximum degree of spherical harmonics lmax = 3. We use outer averaging, which averages over the power spectrum of
different sites.
The graph representation of each molecule is processed by the Spektral package. Each graph is represented by a node feature matrix
X ˘2208 Rs˘00d7dn, an adjacency matrix A ˘2208 Rs˘00d7s, and an edge matrix E ˘2208 Re˘00d7de, where s is the number of atoms in
the molecule, e is the number of bonds, and dn, de are the number of features for nodes and edges, respectively.
The properties that we use from the QM9 dataset are listed in Table 2. We separate these properties into two categories: (1) the
ground state quantities which are calculated from a single DFT calculation of the molecule and include geometric, energetic, and
electronic quantities, and (2) the thermodynamic quantities which are typically calculated from a molecular dynamics simulation.

The auxiliary information for this task consists of the properties listed in Table 2 that are in the same category as the objective
property, as these properties would be calculated together. The objective function then simply picks out the corresponding feature
from the auxiliary information. More precisely, for the ground state objectives, the auxiliary information is:
z = [A, B, C, µ, α, ϵHOMO, ϵLUMO, ϵgap, < R2 >] ∈R9
(12)

and the objective functions are:
hα(z) = z5

(13)
hϵgap(z) = z8

where the quantities for the latter objective are normalized so that they have the same magnitude.

Bayesian Optimization and Acquisition Function
Our algorithm for Bayesian optimization using auxiliary information z is shown in Algorithm 1. This algorithm reduces to the basic
BO algorithm in the case where h is the identity function and Z = Y such that we can ignore mention of z in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 Bayesian optimization with auxiliary information
1:
Input: Labelled dataset Dtrain = {(xn, zn, yn)}Nstart=5
n=1
2:
for N = 5 to 1000 do
3:
Train M : X →Z on Dtrain
4:
Form an unlabelled dataset, Xpool
5:
Find xN+1 = arg maxx∈Xpool α(x; M, Dtrain)
6:
Label the data zN+1 = g(xN+1), yN+1 = h(zN+1)
7:
Dtrain = Dtrain ∪(xN+1, zN+1, yN+1)
end for
As mentioned in the main text, the inner optimization loop in line 5 of Algorithm 1 is performed by finding the maximum value
of ˘03b1 over a pool of |Xpool| randomly sampled points. We can see in Figure 6 that increasing |Xpool| in the acquisition step
tends to improve BO performance. Thus, there is likely further room for improvement of the inner optimization loop using more
sophisticated algorithms, possibly using the gradient information provided by BNNs. Unless otherwise stated, we optimize the inner
loop of Bayesian optimization to choose the next data point to label by maximizing EI on a pool of |Xpool| = 105 randomly sampled
points.

ybest is taken from the narrowband objective function using the ensemble architecture. The ˘201caux˘201d in the legend denotes
using auxiliary information and the numbers represent the architecture (i.e. 8 layers of 256 units or 16 layers of 512 units).
8.6
Continued Training
As mentioned in Section 2.3 of the main text, the BNN is ideally trained from scratch until convergence in each iteration loop,
although this comes at a great computational cost. An alternative is the warm restart method of continuing the training from the
previous iteration which enables the model˘2019s training loss to converge in only a few epochs. However, as shown in Figure 7, we
have found that naive continued training can result in poor BO performance. This is likely because (a) training does not converge for
the new data point Dnew = (xN +1, yN +1) relative to the rest of the data under a limited computational budget, resulting in the
acquisition function possibly labeling similar points in consecutive iterations, and (b) the BNN gets trapped in a local minima in the
loss landscape that is not ideal for learning future data points. To mitigate this, we use the cosine annealing learning rate. The large
learning rate at the start of training allows the model to more easily escape local minima and explore a multimodal posterior, while
the small learning rate towards the end of the annealing cycle allows the model to converge more easily. Note that the idea of warm
restart is similar to ˘201ccontinual learning,˘201d which is an open and active sub-problem in machine learning research. In particular,
we re-train the BNN using 10 epochs.

8.7
Models and Hyperparameters
8.7.1
Additional Surrogate Models
Variational BNNs model a prior and posterior distribution over the neural network weights but use some approximation on the
distributions to make the BNN tractable. In particular, we use Bayes by Backprop (BBB) (also referred to as the ˘201cmean field˘201d
10
approximation), which approximates the posterior over the neural network weights with independent normal distributions. We also
compare Multiplicative Normalizing Flows (MNF), which uses normalizing flows on top of each layer output for more expressive
posterior distributions.
BOHAMIANN proposed to use BNNs in BO by using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) to approximately
sample the BNN posterior, combined with scale adaptation to adapt it for an iterative setting.
NeuralLinear trains a conventional neural network on the data but then replaces the last layer with Bayesian linear regression such
that the neural network serves as an adaptive basis for the linear regression.
TuRBO (trust region Bayesian Optimization) is a method that maintains M trust regions and performs Bayesian optimization within
each trust region, maintaining M local surrogate models, to scale BO to high-dimensional problems that require thousands of
observations. We use M = 1 and M = 5, labeled as ˘201cTuRBO-1˘201d and ˘201cTuRBO-5˘201d, respectively.
TPE (Tree Parzen Estimator) is a method that instead of modeling p(y|x), models p(x|y) and p(y) for the surrogate model and fits
into the BO framework. The tree-structure of the surrogate model allows it to define leaf variables only when node variables take
particular values, which makes it well-suited for hyper-parameter search (e.g. the learning rate momentum is only defined for
momentum-based gradient descent methods).
LIPO is a parameter-free algorithm that assumes the underlying function is a Lipschitz function and estimates the bounds of the
function. We use the implementation provided by the dlib library.
DIRECT-L (DIviding RECTangles-Local) systematically divides the search domain into smaller and smaller hyperrectangles to
efficiently search the space. We use the implementation provided by the NLopt library.
CMA-ES (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy) is an evolutionary algorithm that samples new data based on a multivariate
normal distribution and refines the parameters of this distribution until reaching convergence. We use the implementation provided
by the pycma library.
8.7.2
Implementation Details
Unless otherwise stated, we set NMC = 30. All BNNs other than the infinitely-wide networks are implemented in TensorFlow v1.
Models are trained using the Adam optimizer using the cosine annealing learning rate with a base learning rate of 10˘22123. All
hidden layers use ReLU as the activation function, and no activation function is applied to the output layer.
Infinite-width neural networks are implemented using the Neural Tangents library. We use two different types of infinite networks:
(1) ˘201cGP-˘201d refers to a closed-form expression for Gaussian process inference using the infinite-width neural network as
a kernel, and (2) ˘201cInf-˘201d refers to an infinite ensemble of infinite-width networks that have been ˘201ctrained˘201d with
continuous gradient descent for an infinite time. We compare NNGP and NTK kernels as well as the parameterization of the layers.
By default, we use the NTK parameterization, but we also use the standard parameterization, denoted by ˘201c-std˘201d.
We implement BO using GPs with a Mat˘00e9rn kernel using the GPyOpt library. The library optimizes over the acquisition function
in the inner loop using the L-BFGS algorithm.

Additional Results
8.8.1
Test Functions
We test BO on several common synthetic functions used for optimization, namely the Branin and 6-dimensional Hartmann functions.
We use BNNs with 4 hidden layers and 256 units in each hidden layer, where each hidden layer is followed by a ReLU activation
function. Plots of the best value ybest at each BO iteration are shown in Figure 8. As expected, GPs perform the best. Ensembles and
BBB also perform competitively and much better than random sampling, showing that deep BO is viable even for low-dimensional
black-box functions.

Nanoparticle Scattering
Detailed BO results for the nanoparticle scattering problem are shown in Table 3.
All the BNNs used for the nanoparticle scattering problem use an architecture consisting of 8 hidden layers with 256 units each,
with the exception of BOHAMIANN where we used the original architecture consisting of 2 hidden layers with 50 units each. The
infinite-width neural networks for the nanoparticle task consist of 8 hidden layers of infinite width, each of which are followed by
ReLU activation functions.

auxiliary information are denoted by a solid line, while those that do not are denoted by a dashed line. Also note that the y-axis is
zoomed in to differentiate the curves. (Bottom) Various non-BO algorithms. Ensemble-aux is replicated here for ease of comparison.
We also experiment with KL annealing in BBB, a proposed method to improve the performance of variational methods for BNNs in
which the weight of the KL term in the loss function is slowly increased throughout training. For these experiments, we exponentially
anneal the KL term with weight ˘03c3KL(i) = 10i/500˘22125 as a function of epoch i when training from scratch; during the continued
training, the weight is held constant at ˘03c3KL = 10˘22123.
KL annealing in the BBB architecture significantly improves performance for the narrowband objective, although results are mixed
for the highpass objective. Additionally, KL annealing has the downside of introducing more parameters that must be carefully tuned
for optimal performance. MNF performs poorly, especially on the highpass objective where it is comparable to random sampling,
and we have found that MNF is quite sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters for uncertainty estimates even on simple regression
problems.
The different variants infinite-width neural networks do not perform as well as the BNNs on both objective functions, despite the
hyperparameter search.
LIPO seems to perform as well as GPs on both objective functions, which is impressive given the computational speed of the LIPO
algorithm. Interestingly DIRECT-L does not perform as well as LIPO or GPs on the narrowband objective, and actually performs
comparably to random sampling on the highpass objective. Additionally, CMA performs poorly on both objectives, likely due to the
highly multimodal nature of the objective function landscape.
We also look at the effect of model size in terms of number of layers and units in Figure 10 for ensembles. While including auxiliary
information clearly improves performance across all architectures, there is not a clear trend of performance with respect to the model
size. Thus, the performance of BO seems to be somewhat robust to the exact architecture as long as the model is large enough to
accurately and efficiently train on the data.

Photonic Crystal
The BNN and BCNN architectures that we use for the PC task are listed in Table 4. The size of the ˘201cFC˘201d architectures are
chosen to have a similar number of parameters as their convolutional counterparts. Unless otherwise stated, all results in the main
text and here use the ˘201cConv-TI˘201d and ˘201cFC˘201d architectures for BCNNs and BNNs, respectively.
The infinite-width convolutional neural networks (which act as convolutional kernels for GPs) in the PC task consist of 5 convolutional
layers followed by 4 fully-connected layers of infinite width. Because the pooling layers in the Neural Tangents library are currently
too slow for use in application, we increased the size of the filters to 5 ˘00d7 5 to increase the receptive field of each filter.
Detailed BO results for the PC problem are shown in Table 5. For algorithms that optimize over the level set parameterization R51,
we see that GPs perform consistently well, although BNNs using auxiliary information (e.g. Ensemble-Aux) can outperform GPs.
DIRECT-L and CMA perform extremely well on the PC-A distribution but performs worse than GP on the PC-B distribution.
Adding convolutional layers and auxiliary information improves performance such that BCNNs significantly outperform GPs.
Interestingly, the infinite-width networks perform extremely poorly, although this may be due to a lack of pooling layers in their
architecture which limits the receptive field of the convolutions.
Examples of the optimized structures by the ˘201cEnsemble-aux˘201d architecture are shown in Figure 12. The photonic crystal unit
cells generally converged to the same shape: a square lattice of silicon posts with periodicity.

To explore more deeply why certain surrogate models perform well while others do not, we track various metrics of the model
during BO on a validation dataset with 1000 randomly sampled data points. In particular, we look at the mean squared error (MSE),
the mean absolute error (MAE), the negative log-likelihood (NLL), and the calibration error on the PC-A data distribution. Results
are shown in Figure 13(a).
The calibration error is a quantitative measure of the uncertainty of the model, which is important for the performance of BO as
the acquisition function uses the uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation. Intuitively, we expect that a 50% confidence
interval contains the correct answer 50

models that have an analytical predictive distribution. For models that do not have an analytical predictive distribution, we use the

Uncertainty calibration curves measured at various points during BO. Note that the calibration curve for GP-aux is only shown for N
= 50, as it becomes computationally intractable for larger N.
Figure 13 shows that the infinite neural network kernel (NTK) has the highest prediction error, which is likely a contributing factor
to its poor BO performance. Interestingly, vanilla GPs have the lowest MSE, so the prediction error is not the only indicator for
BO performance. Looking at the calibration, the infinite neural network kernel has the highest calibration error, and we see from
Figure 13(b) that it tends to be overconfident in its predictions. GPs have a higher calibration error than the ensemble neural network
methods and tend to be significantly underconfident in their predictions. GP-aux has higher validation loss, calibration error, and
NLL than most, if not all, of the other methods, which explain its poor performance.
The ensemble NN methods tend to be reasonably well-calibrated. Within the ensemble NNs, the ""-aux"" methods have lower MSE
and calibration error than their respective counterparts, and ConvEnsemble-aux has the lowest NLL calibration error out of all the
methods, although interestingly Ensemble-aux seems to have the lowest MSE and MAE out of the ensemble NNs.
These results together show that calibration of Bayesian models is extremely important for use as surrogate models in BO.

Organic Molecule Quantum Chemistry
The Bayesian graph neural networks (BGNNs) used for the chemical property optimization task consist of 4 edge-conditioned graph
convolutional layers with 32 channels each, followed by a global average pooling operation, followed by 4 fully-connected hidden
layers of 64 units each. The edge-conditioned graph convolutional layers are implemented by Spektral.
More detailed results for the quantum chemistry dataset are shown in Table 6 and Figure 14. The architecture with the Bayes by
Backprop variational approximation applied to every layer, including the graph convolutional layers (˘201cBBB˘201d), performs
extremely poorly, even worse than random sampling in some cases. However, only making the fully-connected layers Bayesian
(˘201cBBB-FC˘201d) performs surprisingly well.

Figure 9: Additional BO results for several different objective functions on the chemistry dataset. GP and GraphEnsemble-aux
curves are replicated from the main text for convenience.
Ensembles trained with auxiliary information (˘201cEnsemble-aux˘201d) and neural linear (˘201cNeuralLinear˘201d) perform the best
on all objective functions. Adding auxiliary information to ensembles helps for the ˘03b1 objective function, and neither helps nor
hurts for the other objective functions. Additionally, BNNs perform at least as well or significantly better than GPs in all cases. GPs
perform comparably or worse than random sampling in several cases.
As noted in the main text, the performance of VAE-GP depends on the quality of the pre-trained VAE, as shown in Figure 15. The
VAE-GP benchmark uses the same pre-trained VAE, and ˘201cVAE-GP-2˘201d refers to the same method using a different random
seed for the VAE. Even with the exact same method, VAE-GP-2 performs significantly worse on both objective functions. We also
increase the latent space dimensionality from 52 to 128 in the ˘201cVAE-GP-LATENT128˘201d benchmark, which performs even
worse on the ˘03b1 ˘2212 ˘20acgap benchmark although it performs significantly better on the ˘03c9 benchmark. We also adjust the
learning rate momentum to ˘03b7 = 0.001 in ˘201cVAE-GP-LATENT128-BETA0.001˘201d, and the latent space dimensionality to 32
in ˘201cVAE-GP-LATENT32˘201d. There is no clear trend with the different hyperparameters, which may point to the random seed
of the VAE pre-training being a greater factor in BO performance than the hyperparameters.

Validation Metrics
As in Appendix A.5.3, we track the MSE, NLL, and calibration error during optimization on the chemistry task. Results are shown
in Figure 16. The various metrics correlate with the respective methods˘2019 performances during BO. For example, VAE-GP has
an extremely high MSE and calibration error on the ˘03b1 objective, where it performs poorly, but has an MSE and calibration
error more comparable with that of other methods as well as an extremely low NLL on the ˘03c9 ˘2212 ˘20acgap objective, where it
performs extremely well. Likewise, the metrics for GRAPHGP are very high on the ˘03b1 ˘2212 ˘20acgap objective, where it performs
poorly. GraphEnsemble tends to be among the better methods in terms of these metrics, which translates into good BO performance.

Additional Discussion
BBB performs reasonably well and is competitive with or even better than ensembles on some tasks, but it requires significant
hyperparameter tuning. The tendency of variational methods such as BBB to underestimate uncertainty is likely detrimental to their
performance in BO. Additionally, prior work shows that BBB has trouble scaling to larger network sizes, which may make them
unsuitable for more complex tasks such as those in our work. BOHAMIANN performs very well on the nanoparticle narrowband
objective and comparable to other BNNs without auxiliary information on the nanoparticle highpass objective. This is likely due to
its effectiveness in exploring a multi-modal posterior. However, the need for SGHMC to sample the posterior makes this method
computationally expensive, and so we were only able to run it for a limited number of iterations using a small neural network
architecture.
Infinitely wide neural networks are another interesting research direction, as the ability to derive infinitely wide versions of various
neural network architectures such as convolutions, and more recently graph convolutional layers, could potentially bring the power
of GPs and BO to complex problems in low-data regimes. However, we find they perform relatively poorly in BO, are quite sensitive
to hyperparameters (e.g. kernel and parameterization), and current implementations of certain operations such as pooling are too
slow for practical use in an iterative setting. In particular, BO using an infinite ensemble of infinite-width networks performs poorly
compared to normal ensembles, suggesting that the infinite-width formulations do not fully capture the dynamics of their finite-width
counterparts.
Non-Bayesian global optimization methods such as LIPO and DIRECT-L are quite powerful in spite of their small computational
overhead and can even outperform BO on some simpler tasks. However, they are not as consistent as BO, performing more
comparably to random sampling on other tasks. CMA-ES performs poorly on all the tasks here. Also, like GPs, these non-Bayesian
algorithms assume a continuous input space and cannot be effectively applied to structured, high-dimensional problems.

P118.pdf,"Distant Supervision from Disparate Sources for
Low-Resource Part-of-Speech Tagging
Abstract
We introduce DSDS: a cross-lingual neural part-of-speech tagger that learns from
disparate sources of distant supervision, and realistically scales to hundreds of low-
resource languages. The model exploits annotation projection, instance selection,
tag dictionaries, morphological lexicons, and distributed representations, all in a
uniform framework. The approach is simple, yet surprisingly effective, resulting in
a new state of the art without access to any gold annotated data.
1
Introduction
Low-resource languages lack manually annotated data to learn even the most basic models such
as part-of-speech (POS) taggers. To compensate for the absence of direct supervision, work in
crosslingual learning and distant supervision has discovered creative use for a number of alternative
data sources to learn feasible models:
However, only one or two compatible sources of distant supervision are typically employed. In
reality severely under-resourced languages may require a more pragmatic “take what you can get”
viewpoint. Our results suggest that combining supervision sources is the way to go about creating
viable low-resource taggers.
We propose a method to strike a balance between model simplicity and the capacity to easily integrate
heterogeneous learning signals.
system is a uniform neural model for POS tagging that learns from disparate sources of distant
supervision (DSDS). We use it to combine: i) multi-source annotation projection, ii) instance
selection, iii) noisy tag dictionaries, and iv) distributed word and sub-word representations. We
examine how far we can get by exploiting only the wide-coverage resources that are currently readily
available for more than 300 languages, which is the breadth of the parallel corpus we employ.
DSDS yields a new state of the art by jointly leveraging disparate sources of distant supervision in an
experiment with 25 languages. We demonstrate: i) substantial gains in carefully selecting high-quality
instances in annotation projection, ii) the usefulness of lexicon features for neural tagging, and iii)
the importance of word embeddings initialization for faster convergence.
2
Method
DSDS is illustrated in Figure 1. The base model is a bidirectional long short-term memory network
(bi-LSTM)
Annotation projection. Ever since the seminal work of projecting sequential labels from source to
target languages has been one of the most prevalent approaches to crosslingual learning. Its only
requirement is that parallel texts are available between the languages, and that the source side is
annotated for POS.
We apply the approach by where labels are projected from multiple sources and then decoded through
weighted majority voting with word alignment probabilities and source POS tagger confidences. We
exploit their widecoverage Watchtower corpus (WTC), in contrast to the typically used Europarl data.
Europarl covers 21 languages of the EU with 400k-2M sentence pairs, while WTC spans 300+ widely
diverse languages with only 10-100k pairs, in effect sacrificing depth for breadth, and introducing a
more radical domain shift. However, as our results show little projected data turns out to be the most
beneficial, reinforcing breadth for depth.
While selected 20k projected sentences at random to train taggers, we propose a novel alternative:
selection by coverage. We rank the target sentences by percentage of words covered by word
alignment from 21 sources and select the top k covered instances for training. In specific, we employ
the mean coverage ranking of target sentences, whereby each target sentence is coupled with the
arithmetic mean of the 21 individual word alignment coverages for each of the 21 source-language
sentences. We show that this simple approach to instance selection offers substantial improvements:
across all languages, we learn better taggers with significantly fewer training instances.
Dictionaries. Dictionaries are a useful source or distant supervision. There are several ways to
exploit such information: i) as type constraints during encoding, ii) to guide unsupervised learning,
or iii) as addiional signal at training. We focus on the latter and evaluate two ways to integrate
lexical knowledge into neural models, while comparing to the former wo: a) by representing lexicon
properties as n-hot vector (e.g., if a word has two properties according to lexicon src, it results
in a 2-hot vector, if the word is not present in src, a zero vector), with m the number of lexicon
properties; b) by embedding the lexical features, i.e., is a lexicon src embedded into an /-dimensional
space. We represent as concatenation of all embedded m properies of length [, and a zero vector
otherwise. Tuning on the dev set, we found the second embedding approach to perform best, and
simple concatenaion outperformed mean vector representations.
We evaluate two dictionary sources, motivated by ease of accessibility to many languages: WIK-
TIONARY, a word type dictionary that maps tokens to one of the 12 Universal POS tags; and
UNIMORPH, a morphological dictionary that provides inflectional paradigms across 350 languages.
For Wiktionary, we use the freely available dictionaries from The size of the dictionaries ranges from
a few thousands (e.g., Hindi and Bulgarian) to 2M (Finnish UniMorph). Sizes are provided in Table
1, 1st columns. UniMorph covers between 8-38 morphological properties (for English and Finnish,
respectively).
Word embeddings. Embeddings are available for many languages. Pre-initialization of offers
consistent and considerable performance improvements in our distant supervision setup (Section 4).
We use off-the-shelf Polyglot embeddings, which performed consistently better than FastText.
3
Experiments
Baselines. We compare to the following weaklysupervised POS taggers: AGIC: Multi-source
annotation projection with Bible parallel data DAS: The label propagation approach by over Europarl
data. GARRETTE: The approach by that works with projections, dictionaries, and unlabeled target
text. LI: Wiktionary supervision.
Data. Our set of 25 languages is motivated by accessibility to embeddings and dictionaries. In all
experiments we work with the 12 Universal POS tags. For development, we use 21 dev sets of the
Universal Dependencies 2.1. We employ UD test sets on additional languages as well as the test sets
of to facilitate comparisons. Their test sets are a mixture of CoNLL and HamleDT test data, and are
more distant from the training and development data.
Model and parameters. We extend an off-theshelf state-of-the-art bi-LSTM tagger with lexicon
information. The code is available at: https:// github.com/bplank/bilstm-aux. The parameter l=40
was set on dev data across all languages. Besides using 10 epochs, word dropout rate (p=.25) and
40-dimensional lexicon embeddings, we use the parameters from For all experiments, we average
over 3 randomly seeded runs, and provide mean accuracy. For the learning curve, we average over 5
random samples with 3 runs each.
4
Results
Table 1 shows the tagging accuracy for individual languages, while the means over all languages are
given in Figure 2. There are several take-aways.
2
Data selection. The first take-away is that coverage-based instance selection yields substan-
tially better training data. Most prior work on annotation projection resorts to arbitrary selection;
informed selection clearly helps in this noisy data setup, as shown in Figure 2 (a). Training on 5k
instances results in a sweet spot; more data (10k) starts to decrease performance, at a cost of runtime.
Training on all WTC data (around 120k) is worse for most languages. From now on we consider the
5k model trained with Polyglot as our baseline (Table 1, column “5k”), obtaining a mean accuracy of
83.0 over 21 languages.
Embeddings initialization. Polyglot initialization offers a large boost; on average +3.8% absolute
improvement in accuracy for our 5k training scheme, as shown in Figure 2 (b). The big gap in
low-resource setups further shows their effectiveness, with up to 10% absolute increase in accuracy
when training on only 500 instances.
Lexical information. The main take-away is that lexical information helps neural tagging, and
embedding it proves the most helpful. Embedding Wiktionary tags reaches 83.7 accuracy on average,
versus 83.4 for n-hot encoding, and 83.2 for type constraints. Only on 4 out of 21 languages are
type constraints better. This is the case for only one language for n-hot encoding (French). The best
approach is to embed both Wiktionary and Unimorph, boosting performance further to 84.0, and
resulting in our final model. It helps the most on morphological rich languages such as Uralic.
On the test sets (Table 4, right) DSDS reaches 87.2 over 8 test languages intersecting and. It reaches
86.2 over the more commonly used 8 languages of, compared to their 83.4. This shows that our
novel “soft” inclusion of noisy dictionaries is superior to a hard decoding restriction, and including
lexicons in neural taggers helps. We did not assume any gold data to further enrich the lexicons, nor
fix possible tagset divergences.
5
Discussion
Analysis. The inclusion of lexicons results in higher coverage and is part of the explanation for the
improvement of DSDS; see correlation in Figure 3 (a). What is more interesting is that our model
benefits from the lexicon beyond its content: OOV accuracy for words not present in the lexicon
overall improves, besides the expected improvement on known OOV, see Figure 3 (b).
More languages. All data sources employed in our experiment are very high-coverage. However, for
true low-resource languages, we cannot safely assume the availability of all disparate information
sources. Table 2 presents results for four additional languages where some supervision sources
are missing. We observe that adding lexicon information always helps, even in cases where only
1k entries are available, and embedding it is usually the most beneficial way. For closely-related
languages such as Serbian and Croatian, using resources for one aids tagging the other, and modern
resources are a better fit. For example, using the Croatian WTC projections to train a model for
Serbian is preferable over in-language Serbian Bible data where the OOV rate is much higher.
How much gold data? We assume not having access to any gold annotated data. It is thus interesting
to ask how much gold data is needed to reach our performance. This is a tricky question, as training
within the same corpus naturally favors the same corpus data. We test both in-corpus (UD)
and out-of-corpus data (our test sets) and notice an important gap: while in-corpus only 50 sentences
are sufficient, outside the corpus one would need over 200 sentences. This experiment was done for a
subset of 18 languages with both inand out-ofcorpus test data.
Further comparison. In Table 1 we directly report the accuracies from the original contributions by
DAS, LI, GARRETTE, and AGIC over the same test data. We additionally attempted to reach the
scores of LI by running their tagger over the Table 1 data setup. The results are depicted in Figure
4 as mean accuracies over EM iterations until convergence. We show: i) LI peaks at 10 iterations
for their test languages, and at 35 iterations for all the rest. This is in slight contrast to 50 iterations
that recommend, although selecting 50 does not dramatically hurt the scores; ii) Our replication falls
˘223c5 points short of their 84.9 accuracy. There is a large 33-point accuracy gap between the scores
of, where the dictionaries are large, and the other languages in Figure 4, with smaller dictionaries.
Compared to DAS, our tagger clearly benefits from pre-trained word embeddings, while theirs relies
on label propagation through Europarl, a much cleaner corpus that lacks the coverage of the noisier
WTC. Similar applies to as they use 1-5M near-perfect parallel sentences. Even if we use much

Related Work
Most successful work on low-resource POS tagging is based on projection, tag dictionaries, annotation
of seed training data or even more recently some combination of these, e.g., via multi-task learning.
Our paper contributes to this literature by leveraging a range of prior directions in a unified, neural
test bed.
Most prior work on neural sequence prediction follows the commonly perceived wisdom that hand-
crafted features are unnecessary for deep learning methods. They rely on end-to-end training without
resorting to additional linguistic resources. Our study shows that this is not the case. Only few prior
studies investigate such sources, e.g., for MT and for POS tagging use lexicons, but only as n-hot
features and without examining the cross-lingual aspect.

surprisingly effective for low-resource POS tagging. Only 5k instances of projected data paired with
off-the-shelf embeddings and lexical information integrated into a neural tagger are sufficient to reach
a new state of the art, and both data selection and embeddings are essential components to boost

Helical Structures and the Sonic Resonance of Kazoo
Instruments in relation to Light Emission Patterns
Abstract
The quintessential nature of DNA is intertwined with the societal implications of
cheese consumption, which in turn affects the molecular structure of refrigerators,
thereby influencing the transcendental properties of Forgotten Sock Syndrome, a
phenomenon wherein the disappearance of footwear is directly correlated to the
harmonic convergence of platypus migration patterns and the aerodynamic proper-
ties of pancakes, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of the Flumplenook
hypothesis, a theoretical framework positing that the essence of DNA is inextricably
linked to the sonorous vibrations of disco music and the average airspeed velocity
of an unladen swallow. The abstract concept of DNA has profound implications
for the study of Interdimensional Croissant Travel and its reciprocal relationship
with the spatial-temporal continuum of Parallel Toaster Universes. Furthermore,
research has shown that the ontological status of DNA is precarious at best, suscep-
tible to fluctuations in the global supply of tartan patterns and the migratory habits
of narwhals, which in turn are influenced by the telekinetic powers of capybaras
and the ontological implications of Socratic dialogue. The interdisciplinary field of
DNA research has far-reaching consequences for our comprehension of Quantum
Flapjack Dynamics and the sentience of household appliances.

Introduction
The intersection of quantum mechanics and pastry dough has led to a deeper understanding of the
molecular structure of DNA, which bears a striking resemblance to the branching patterns of fungal
hyphae in ecosystems dominated by giant sequoias. Meanwhile, the application of topological
invariants to the study of crocheted blankets has yielded surprising insights into the double helix
model, particularly in regards to the torsional stress imposed by excessive twirling of the DNA
molecule, a phenomenon also observed in the whorls of certain seashells. Furthermore, the notion
that DNA is composed of nucleotides has been supplanted by the concept of ""flumplenooks,"" tiny,
invisible particles that defy the laws of classical physics and are thought to be responsible for the
encoding of genetic information, much like the indentations on a well-worn vinyl record. In a related
development, researchers have discovered that the consumption of large quantities of blueberries can
alter the viscosity of DNA, allowing it to flow more easily through narrow capillaries, a property
that has been exploited in the development of novel tattoo inks. The nascent field of ""dnatology"" has
also shed light on the hitherto unknown relationship between DNA and the migration patterns of
monarch butterflies, which, it turns out, are influenced by the presence of ""dnatons,"" hypothetical
particles that interact with the DNA molecule in ways that are not yet fully understood. Additionally,
the study of DNA has been informed by the science of ""flargle dynamics,"" which seeks to explain the
intricate ballet of molecular interactions that govern the behavior of DNA in solution, a phenomenon
that bears a curious resemblance to the dance of subatomic particles in a high-energy collider. In a
surprising twist, the use of interpretive dance as a means of analyzing DNA structure has yielded a
novel understanding of the role of ""splinkle factors"" in gene regulation, which, in turn, has led to a
reappraisal of the importance of ""flibberdejibits"" in the transmission of genetic traits. The work of
numerous researchers has also highlighted the significance of ""wuggle particles"" in the replication
of DNA, which are thought to play a crucial role in the unwinding of the double helix, a process
that has been likened to the unspooling of a ball of twine. Moreover, the application of ""jinkle
theory"" to the study of DNA has revealed the existence of ""flamboozle waves,"" which are believed
to propagate through the DNA molecule, influencing the expression of genes in ways that are still
not fully comprehended. In a related development, the discovery of ""gromble sites"" on the DNA
molecule has opened up new avenues of research into the mechanisms of gene regulation, which,
it is thought, may be influenced by the presence of ""throcklepox particles,"" hypothetical entities
that interact with the DNA molecule in complex and subtle ways. The field of ""dnatology"" has also
been influenced by the study of "" jimjim theory,"" which seeks to explain the behavior of DNA in
terms of the interactions between ""flibulous particles"" and ""wizzlewhacks,"" two types of particles
that are thought to play a crucial role in the transmission of genetic information. Furthermore, the
use of ""kabloinkle analysis"" has revealed the presence of ""flazzle patterns"" in the DNA molecule,
which are believed to be associated with the expression of specific genes, a phenomenon that has
been likened to the emergence of patterns in a kaleidoscope. The study of DNA has also been
informed by the science of ""wumwum dynamics,"" which seeks to explain the complex interactions
between DNA and the surrounding environment, a phenomenon that has been likened to the dance
of molecules in a gas. In a surprising twist, the application of ""flimflam theory"" to the study of
DNA has revealed the existence of ""jinkle waves,"" which are believed to propagate through the DNA
molecule, influencing the expression of genes in ways that are still not fully comprehended. The work

the migration patterns of migratory birds, which, it turns out, are influenced by the presence of
""dnatons,"" hypothetical particles that interact with the DNA molecule in ways that are not yet fully
understood. Furthermore, the application of ""flargle dynamics"" to the study of DNA has yielded a
novel understanding of the role of ""splinkle factors"" in gene regulation, which, in turn, has led to a

Methodology
In order to facilitate a deeper understanding of the molecular structure of DNA, we first examined
the migratory patterns of Canadian geese, noting that their V-formation flight paths bear a striking
resemblance to the double helix model of DNA, which in turn is analogous to the spiral shape of a
nautilus shell, a fact that is not coincidentally related to the harmonic series and the mathematical
constant pi, which is approximately equal to 3.14159, a value that is often used in calculations
involving the circumference of circles, such as the circular motion of a figure skater performing a
triple axel jump, a feat that requires great athleticism and agility, much like the complex molecular
interactions that occur within the nucleus of a cell, where DNA is coiled into a compact structure
known as chromatin, which is composed of histone proteins and other non-histone proteins that play
a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, a process that is influenced by a variety of factors,
including environmental stimuli, such as the color of the walls in a room, which can affect the mood
and behavior of the individuals within it, much like the way in which the color of a sunset can evoke
feelings of serenity and wonder, a sensation that is not dissimilar to the experience of listening to a
symphony orchestra perform a Beethoven concerto, the intricate patterns and harmonies of which are
reminiscent of the complex molecular interactions that occur within the human body, where DNA
plays a central role in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, a
process that is not unlike the way in which a recipe for a traditional dish is passed down through a
family, with each generation adding its own unique twist and flair, much like the way in which a
jazz musician improvises over a familiar melody, creating a new and original composition that is
both rooted in tradition and innovative in its approach, a fact that is not unrelated to the concept of
emergence, which refers to the way in which complex systems and patterns arise from the interactions
of individual components, such as the molecules that make up a DNA molecule, which are composed
of nucleotides, each of which consists of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous
base, the sequence of which determines the genetic information encoded in the DNA molecule, a
code that is not unlike the secret language of a group of children, which is used to convey hidden
meanings and messages, much like the way in which a poet uses metaphor and symbolism to convey
complex emotions and ideas, a fact that is not coincidentally related to the concept of fractals, which
are geometric patterns that repeat themselves at different scales, much like the way in which the
structure of a DNA molecule is repeated in the structure of a cell, and the structure of a cell is repeated

enzymes and other molecules that play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, a process
that is not unlike the way in which a city is planned and developed, with different neighborhoods and
districts serving different functions and purposes, much like the way in which different genes and
gene regulatory elements serve different functions and purposes within the context of a cell, a fact that

composed of smaller, more specialized modules that work together to achieve a common goal, a fact
that is not coincidentally related to the way in which a DNA molecule is composed of smaller, more

its own unique twist and flair, much like the way in which a historian interprets and reinterprets
the past, creating a new and original narrative that is both rooted in tradition and innovative in its

Experiments
The experimental design involved a thorough examination of the effects of cheesecake on DNA
replication, which somehow led to a discussion on the merits of 19th-century French literature
and the role of clockwork mechanisms in modern automotive engineering, particularly in relation
to the aerodynamics of chocolate cakes. As we delved deeper into the mysteries of the double
helix, we found ourselves pondering the significance of fungal growth patterns on polyester fabrics,
and how these patterns might be influenced by the magnetic fields generated by toaster coils. In
an effort to clarify these relationships, we constructed a series of intricate diagrams depicting
the interconnectedness of pastry dough, quadratic equations, and the migratory patterns of lesser-
known species of migratory waterfowl. These diagrams, in turn, revealed a hidden code that, when
deciphered, yielded a recipe for a novel form of gluten-free bread that somehow enhanced the stability
of telomeres in human cells. The implementation of this recipe in our laboratory setting led to a series
of unforeseen consequences, including a sudden proliferation of gelatinous cubes in the vicinity of
our equipment, which we later discovered were, in fact, sentient beings from a parallel universe,
attempting to communicate with us through the medium of interpretive dance.
As we navigated this unexpected turn of events, our research team became increasingly fascinated
with the notion that DNA might, in fact, be a form of sentient, crystalline structure, capable of
transmitting ancient knowledge to those who possesed the requisite harmonic frequency, a concept
that bears a striking resemblance to the theoretical framework underlying the operation of crystal
radios in the early 20th century. This hypothesis led us down a rabbit hole of investigation, wherein
we explored the potential connections between DNA, radio astronomy, and the statistical analysis of
mid-20th-century baseball statistics, ultimately uncovering a hidden pattern that suggested a direct
correlation between the structure of DNA and the optimal strategy for winning at blackjack. In a bold
move to test this hypothesis, we constructed a life-size replica of the Eiffel Tower using nothing but
playing cards and strands of DNA, which, to our surprise, began to glow with a soft, ethereal light, as
if infused with an otherworldly energy that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of space-time
itself.
The findings from this experiment were then used to inform a series of simulations, run on a custom-
built supercomputer powered by a rare form of bioluminescent fungi, which yielded a set of results
that defied all logical explanation, including the appearance of a miniature, swirling vortex in the
center of the laboratory, which seemed to be pulling in nearby objects, including several startled lab
technicians, who were later found to be missing, only to reappear several days later, claiming to have
been transported to a world made entirely of candy. The implications of these findings are still being
debated among our research team, with some arguing that they represent a major breakthrough in
our understanding of DNA, while others contend that they are merely the result of a malfunctioning
toaster that had been left in the laboratory break room.
In an effort to further elucidate the mysteries of DNA, we undertook a comprehensive review of the
existing literature on the subject, which led us to a fascinating paper on the application of ancient
Sumerian cuneiform script to the analysis of modern astrophysical phenomena, and from there, to a
treatise on the art of creating intricate, fractal patterns using nothing but coffee stains and torn pieces
of cardboard. This, in turn, inspired us to develop a novel method for sequencing DNA, based on the
principles of paper folding and the mathematics of knot theory, which we termed ""DNA origami,"" and
which showed great promise in our initial trials, although it did require the use of a highly specialized
form of origami paper, infused with the essence of rare, exotic spices.
As our research continued to unfold, we found ourselves drawn into a realm of inquiry that intersected
with the study of antique door knobs, the sociology of fungal colonies, and the topology of theoretical
wormholes, each of which contributed, in its own unique way, to our evolving understanding of DNA
and its place within the grand tapestry of the universe. It was within this context that we stumbled
upon an obscure reference to a long-lost city, hidden deep within the heart of the Amazon rainforest,
where, according to legend, the ancient inhabitants had possessed a profound understanding of
DNA, which they had used to construct a sprawling, crystalline metropolis, infused with a vibrant,
otherworldly energy that seemed to resonate in harmony with the very fabric of DNA itself.
The discovery of this lost city, and the secrets it held, became an all-consuming passion for our
research team, driving us to embark on a perilous journey into the depths of the jungle, where we
encountered a dazzling array of bizarre creatures, including giant, iridescent butterflies, and towering,
7
humanoid plants, with leaves that shimmered like liquid silver in the sunlight. As we delved deeper
into the heart of the jungle, we began to uncover fragments of an ancient, forgotten language, etched
into the trunks of the trees, which, when deciphered, revealed a hidden code that pointed to the
location of the lost city, and the secrets it held regarding the mysteries of DNA.
Upon finally reaching the lost city, we were met with a sight that defied all expectation, a sprawling,
crystalline metropolis, infused with a vibrant, otherworldly energy that seemed to resonate in harmony
with the very fabric of DNA itself. As we explored the city, we encountered a series of intricate,
glowing artifacts, each of which seemed to hold a piece of the puzzle, regarding the secrets of DNA,
and the role it plays in the grand tapestry of the universe. The experience was nothing short of
transformative, and it left an indelible mark on our research team, as we struggled to come to terms
with the implications of our discovery, and the profound impact it would have on our understanding
of DNA, and the mysteries it holds.

Results
The empirical findings of this study irrefutably demonstrate a statistically significant correlation
between the molecular structure of DNA and the migratory patterns of Scandinavian lemurs, which,
8
coincidentally, have been observed to be aficionados of 19th-century French literature, particularly
the works of Gustave Flaubert, whose writing style has been likened to the intricate double helix
structure of DNA, wherein lies the hidden code of life, much like the cryptic messages embedded in
the lyrics of 1980s new wave music, which, in turn, has been shown to have a profound impact on the
crystalline structures of certain minerals found in the depths of the Amazon rainforest, where the
ancient civilization of lost sock puppets once thrived, leaving behind a legacy of mysterious artifacts
and unexplained phenomena, including the inexplicable ability of certain plants to photosynthesize
in the absence of sunlight, a process that has been likened to the mystical rituals of ancient Druidic
priests, who, in their quest for enlightenment, would often engage in heated debates about the
merits of various types of cheese, a topic that has been extensively studied by experts in the field of
fromage dynamics, a discipline that has been shown to have a direct bearing on the topology of DNA,
particularly in regards to the spatial arrangement of nucleotides, which, when viewed through the
lens of quantum mechanics, reveals a complex web of probabilistic interactions that defy the laws of
classical physics, much like the paradoxical nature of time travel, which, if it were possible, would

P017.pdf,"Detecting and Summarizing Video Highlights with
Lag-Calibration
Abstract
The increasing popularity of video sharing has led to a growing need for automatic
video analysis, including highlight detection. Emerging platforms that feature
crowdsourced, time-synchronized video comments offer a valuable resource for
identifying video highlights. However, this task presents several challenges: (1)
time-synchronized comments often lag behind their corresponding shots; (2) these
comments are frequently sparse and contain noise semantically; and (3) determining
which shots constitute highlights is inherently subjective. This paper introduces
a novel framework designed to address these challenges. The proposed method
uses concept-mapped lexical chains to calibrate the lag in comments, models
video highlights based on comment intensity and the combined concentration
of emotion and concept within each shot, and summarizes detected highlights
using an enhanced SumBasic algorithm that incorporates emotion and concept
mapping. Experiments conducted on extensive real-world datasets demonstrate
that our highlight detection and summarization methods substantially outperform
existing benchmark techniques.
1
Introduction
Billions of hours of video content are viewed daily on platforms like YouTube, with mobile devices
accounting for half of these views. This surge in video sharing has intensified the demand for efficient
video analysis. Consider a scenario where a user wishes to quickly grasp the essence of a lengthy
video without manually navigating through it. Automatically generated highlights would enable
users to digest the video’s key moments in a matter of minutes, aiding their decision on whether to
watch the full video later. Furthermore, automated video highlight detection and summarization can
significantly enhance video indexing, search, and recommendation systems.
However, extracting highlights from a video is a complex task. Firstly, the perception of a ""highlight""
can vary significantly among individuals. Secondly, analyzing low-level features such as image, audio,
and motion may not always capture the essence of a highlight. The absence of high-level semantic
information poses a significant limitation to highlight detection in conventional video processing.
The recent emergence of crowdsourced, time-synchronized video comments, also known as ""bullet-
screen comments,"" presents a new avenue for highlight detection. These real-time comments, which
appear overlaid on the video screen, are synchronized with the video frames. This phenomenon has
gained widespread popularity on platforms like niconico in Japan, Bilibili and Acfun in China, and
YouTube Live and Twitch Live in the USA. The prevalence of time-synchronized comments offers a
unique opportunity for leveraging natural language processing in video highlight detection.
Nevertheless, using time-synchronized comments for highlight detection and labeling still poses
significant challenges. Primarily, there is an almost unavoidable delay between comments and their
corresponding shots. As illustrated in Figure 1, discussions about a particular shot may continue
into subsequent shots. Highlight detection and labeling without accounting for this lag may yield
inaccurate outcomes. Secondly, time-synchronized comments are often semantically sparse, both
in terms of the number of comments per shot and the number of words per comment. This sparsity
can hinder the performance of traditional bag-of-words statistical models. Thirdly, determining
highlights in an unsupervised manner, without prior knowledge, involves considerable uncertainty.
The defining characteristics of highlights must be clearly defined, captured, and modeled to ensure
accurate detection.
To our knowledge, limited research has focused on unsupervised highlight detection and labeling
using time-synchronized comments. The most relevant work in this area proposes detecting highlights
based on the topic concentration derived from semantic vectors of bullet-comments, and labeling each
highlight using a pre-trained classifier based on predefined tags. However, we contend that emotion
concentration holds greater significance than general topic concentration in highlight detection.
Another study suggests extracting highlights based on the frame-by-frame similarity of emotion
distributions. However, neither of these approaches addresses the combined challenges of lag
calibration, balancing emotion-topic concentration, and unsupervised highlight labeling.
To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the following solutions: (1) employ word-to-
concept and word-to-emotion mapping based on global word embedding, enabling the construction of
lexical chains for calibrating the lag in bullet-comments; (2) detect highlights based on the emotional
and conceptual concentration and intensity of the lag-calibrated bullet-comments; and (3) summarize
highlights using a modified Basic Sum algorithm that considers emotions and concepts as fundamental
units within a bullet-comment.
The main contributions of this research are as follows: (1) We introduce a completely unsupervised
framework for detecting and summarizing video highlights using time-synchronized comments;
(2) We introduce a lag-calibration method that uses concept-mapped lexical chains; (3) We have
created extensive datasets for bullet-comment word embedding, an emotion lexicon tailored for
bullet-comments, and ground-truth data for evaluating highlight detection and labeling based on
bullet-comments.

Related Work
2.1
Highlight detection by video processing
Following the definition from previous research, we define highlights as the most memorable shots in
a video characterized by high emotional intensity. It’s important to note that highlight detection differs
from video summarization. While video summarization aims to provide a condensed representation
of a video’s storyline, highlight detection focuses on extracting its emotionally impactful content.
In the realm of highlight detection, some researchers have proposed representing video emotions as a
curve on the arousal-valence plane, utilizing low-level features such as motion, vocal effects, shot
length, and audio pitch, or color, along with mid-level features like laughter and subtitles. However,
due to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics, the accuracy of highlight
detection based solely on video processing is limited.
2.2
Temporal text summarization
Research on temporal text summarization shares similarities with the present study but also exhibits
key distinctions. Several works have approached temporal text summarization as a constrained
multi-objective optimization problem, a graph optimization problem, a supervised learning-to-rank
problem, and as an online clustering problem.
This study models highlight detection as a simpler two-objective optimization problem with specific
constraints. However, the features employed to assess the ""highlightness"" of a shot diverge from
those used in the aforementioned studies. Given that highlight shots are observed to correlate with
high emotional intensity and topic concentration, coverage and non-redundancy are not primary
optimization goals, as they are in temporal text summarization. Instead, our focus is on modeling
emotional and topic concentration within the context of this study.
2.3
Crowdsourced time-sync comment mining
Several studies have explored the use of crowdsourced time-synchronized comments for tagging
videos on a shot-by-shot basis. These approaches involve manual labeling and supervised training,
2
temporal and personalized topic modeling, or tagging the video as a whole. One work proposes
generating a summarization for each shot through data reconstruction that jointly considers textual
and topic levels.
One work proposed a centroid-diffusion algorithm to identify highlights. Shots are represented by
latent topics found through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Another method suggests using pre-
trained semantic vectors of comments to cluster them into topics and subsequently identify highlights
based on topic concentration. Additionally, they utilize predefined labels to train a classifier for
highlight labeling. The current study differs from these two studies in several ways. First, before
performing highlight detection, we apply a lag-calibration step to mitigate inaccuracies caused
by comment delays. Second, we represent each scene using a combination of topic and emotion
concentration. Third, we perform both highlight detection and labeling in an unsupervised manner.
2.4
Lexical chain
Lexical chains represent sequences of words that exhibit a cohesive relationship spanning multiple
sentences. Early work on lexical chains used syntactic relationships of words from Roget’s Thesaurus,
without considering word sense disambiguation. Subsequent research expanded lexical chains by
incorporating WordNet relations and word sense disambiguation. Lexical chains are also built
utilizing word-embedded relations for disambiguating multi-word expressions. This study constructs
lexical chains for accurate lag calibration, leveraging global word embedding.

Problem Formulation
The problem addressed in this paper can be formulated as follows: The input consists of a set of
time-synchronized comments, denoted as C = {c1, c2, c3, . . . , cn}, along with their correspond-
ing timestamps T = {t1, t2, t3, . . . , tn} for a given video v. We are also given a compression
ratio ρhighlight that determines the number of highlights to be generated, and a compression ratio
ρsummary that specifies the number of comments to be included in each highlight summary. Our
objective is twofold: (1) to generate a set of highlight shots S(v) = {s1, s2, s3, . . . , sm}, and (2)
to produce highlight summaries Σ(v) = {C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cm} that closely align with the ground
truth. Each highlight summary Ci comprises a subset of the comments associated with that shot:
Ci = {c1, c2, c3, . . . , ck}. The number of highlight shots m and the number of comments in each
summary k are determined by ρhighlight and ρsummary, respectively.

Video Highlight Detection
This section introduces our proposed framework for detecting video highlights. We also describe
two preliminary tasks: constructing a global word embedding for time-synchronized comments and
building an emotion lexicon.
4.1
Preliminaries
Word-Embedding of Time-Sync Comments
As previously highlighted, a key challenge in analyzing time-synchronized comments is their semantic
sparsity, stemming from the limited number of comments and their brevity. Two semantically related
words might not appear related if they don’t co-occur frequently within a single video. To address this,
we construct a global word embedding based on a large collection of time-synchronized comments.
This word-embedding dictionary can be represented as: D = {(w1 : v1), (w2 : v2), . . . , (wn : vn)},
where wi is a word, vi is its corresponding word vector, and n is the vocabulary size of the corpus.
Emotion Lexicon Construction
Extracting emotions from time-synchronized comments is crucial for highlight detection, as em-
phasized earlier. However, traditional emotion lexicons are not directly applicable in this context
due to the prevalence of internet slang specific to these platforms. For example, ""23333"" signifies
laughter (""ha ha ha""), and ""6666"" expresses admiration (""really awesome""). Therefore, we construct
an emotion lexicon tailored for time-synchronized comments, derived from the word-embedding
3
dictionary generated in the previous step. We begin by manually labeling words corresponding to
the five basic emotion categories (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise) as seeds, selecting
from the most frequent words in the corpus. The sixth emotion category, ""disgust,"" is omitted due
to its rarity in the dataset but can be easily incorporated for other datasets. We then expand this
emotion lexicon by identifying the top N neighbors of each seed word in the word-embedding space.
A neighbor is added to the seeds if it meets a minimum percentage of overlap θoverlap with all seeds,
with a minimum similarity score of simmin. Neighbors are determined based on cosine similarity
within the word-embedding space.
4.2
Lag-Calibration
This section details our method for lag calibration, which involves concept mapping, constructing
word-embedded lexical chains, and performing the actual calibration.
Concept Mapping
To tackle semantic sparsity in time-synchronized comments and build lexical chains of semantically
related words, we first map words with similar meanings to the same concept. Given a set of
comments C for a video v, we define a mapping F from the vocabulary VC of comments C to a set of
concepts KC:
F : VC →KC
(|VC| ≥|KC|)
Specifically, the mapping F assigns each word wi to a concept k = F(wi) as follows:
F(wi) = F(w1) = F(w2) = . . . = F(wtop_n) = k,
∃k ∈KC
s.t.
{w|w ∈top_n(wi) ∧F(w) = k}/|top_n(wi)| ≥θoverlap
top_n(wi) returns the n nearest neighbors of word wi based on cosine similarity. For each word wi
in the comments C, we examine the percentage of its neighbors that have already been mapped to
a concept k. If this percentage exceeds the threshold θoverlap, then word wi and its neighbors are
mapped to concept k. Otherwise, they are assigned to a new concept, represented by wi itself.
Lexical Chain Construction
The next step involves constructing all lexical chains present in the time-synchronized comments for
video v. This enables the calibration of lagged comments based on these chains. A lexical chain lik
consists of a set of triples lik = {(w, t, c)}, where w is the actual word mentioned for concept k in
comment c, and t is the timestamp of comment c. We create a lexical chain dictionary LC for the
time-synchronized comments C of video v:
LC = {k1 : (l11, l12, l13, . . .), k2 : (l21, l22, l23, . . .), . . . , kn : (ln1, ln2, ln3, . . .)}
where ki ∈KC represents a concept, and lik is the i-th lexical chain associated with concept k. The
procedure for constructing these lexical chains is detailed in Algorithm 1.
Specifically, each comment in C can either be appended to an existing lexical chain or added to a
new, empty chain. This decision is based on the comment’s temporal distance from existing chains,
controlled by the maximum silence parameter tsilence.
It’s important to note that word senses within the constructed lexical chains are not disambiguated,
unlike in most traditional algorithms. However, we argue that these lexical chains remain useful
because our concept mapping is built from time-synchronized comments in their natural order.
This progressive semantic continuity naturally reinforces similar word senses for temporally close
comments. This continuity, combined with global word embedding, ensures the validity of our
concept mapping in most scenarios.
Comment Lag-Calibration
With the lexical chain dictionary LC constructed, we can now calibrate the comments in C based on
their respective lexical chains. Our observations indicate that the initial comment pertaining to a
shot typically occurs within that shot, while subsequent comments may not. Therefore, we adjust
the timestamp of each comment to match the timestamp of the first element within its corresponding
lexical chain. If a comment belongs to multiple lexical chains (concepts), we select the chain with the
highest score scorechain. The scorechain is calculated as the sum of the frequencies of each word
4
in the chain, weighted by the logarithm of their global frequencies, denoted as log(D(w).count).
Consequently, each comment will be assigned to its most semantically significant lexical chain
(concept) for calibration. The calibration algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2.
It’s worth noting that if multiple consecutive shots, {s1, s2, . . . , sn}, contain comments with similar
content, our lag-calibration method might shift many comments from shots s2, s3, . . . , sn to the
timestamp of the first shot, s1, if these comments are connected through lexical chains originating
from s1. This is not necessarily a drawback, as it helps us avoid selecting redundant consecutive
highlight shots and allows for the inclusion of other potential highlights, given a fixed compression
ratio.
4.3
Shot Importance Scoring
In this section, we first segment comments into shots of equal temporal length, denoted as tshot. We
then model the importance of each shot, enabling highlight detection based on these importance
scores.
A shot’s importance is modeled as a function of two factors: comment concentration and commenting
intensity. Regarding comment concentration, as mentioned earlier, both concept and emotional
concentration contribute to highlight detection. For instance, a cluster of concept-concentrated
comments like ""the background music/bgm/soundtrack of this shot is classic/inspiring/the best"" could
indicate a highlight related to memorable background music. Similarly, comments such as ""this plot
is so funny/hilarious/lmao/lol/2333"" might suggest a highlight characterized by a single concentrated
emotion. Therefore, our model combines these two types of concentration. We define the emotional
concentration Cemotion(Cs) of shot s based on time-synchronized comments Cs and the emotion
lexicon E as follows:
Cemotion(Cs) = 1 −P|E|
e=1 pe log(pe)
pe = |{w|w∈Cs∧w∈E(e)}|
|Cs|
Here, we calculate the inverse of the entropy of probabilities for the five emotions within a shot to
represent emotion concentration. Next, we define topical concentration Ctopic as:
Ctopic(Cs) = 1
J
PJ
j=1 pj log(pj)
pj =
P
w∈Cs∩F(kj )
1
log(D(w))
P
w∈Cs
1
log(D(w))
where we calculate the inverse of the entropy of all concepts within a shot to represent topic
concentration. The probability of each concept k is determined by the sum of the frequencies of
its mentioned words, weighted by their global frequencies, and then divided by the sum of these
weighted frequencies for all words in the shot.
Now, the comment importance Icomment(Cs, s) of shot s can be defined as:
Icomment(Cs, s) = λ · Cemotion(Cs, s) + (1 −λ) · Ctopic(Cs, s)
where λ is a hyperparameter that controls the balance between emotion and concept concentration.
Finally, the overall importance of a shot is defined as:
I(Cs, s) = Icomment(Cs, s) · log(|Cs|)
where |Cs| represents the total length of all time-synchronized comments within shot s, serving as a
straightforward yet effective indicator of comment intensity per shot.
The problem of highlight detection can now be formulated as a maximization problem:
Maximize P

Video Highlight Summarization
Given a set of detected highlight shots S(v) = {s1, s2, s3, . . . , sm} for video v, each associated with
its lag-calibrated comments Cs, our goal is to generate summaries Σ(v) = {C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cm}
such that Ci ⊂Csi, with a compression ratio of ρsummary, and Ci closely resembles the ground
truth.
We propose a simple yet highly effective summarization model, building upon SumBasic with
enhancements that incorporate emotion and concept mapping, along with a two-level updating
mechanism.
In our modified SumBasic, instead of solely down-weighting the probabilities of words in a selected
sentence to mitigate redundancy, we down-weight the probabilities of both words and their mapped
concepts to re-weight each comment. This two-level updating approach achieves two key objectives:
(1) it penalizes the selection of sentences containing semantically similar words, and (2) it allows for
the selection of a sentence with a word already present in the summary if that word occurs significantly
more frequently. Additionally, we introduce an emotion bias parameter, bemotion, to weight words
and concepts during probability calculations. This increases the frequencies of emotional words and
concepts by a factor of bemotion compared to non-emotional ones.

Experiment
This section presents the experiments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets to evaluate
highlight detection and summarization. We describe the data collection process, evaluation metrics,
benchmark methods, and experimental results.
6.1
Data
This section describes the datasets collected and constructed for our experiments. All datasets and
code will be made publicly available on Github.
Crowdsourced Time-sync Comment Corpus
To train the word embedding described earlier, we collected a large corpus of time-synchronized
comments from Bilibili, a content-sharing website in China that features such comments. The corpus
comprises 2,108,746 comments, 15,179,132 tokens, and 91,745 unique tokens, extracted from 6,368
long videos. On average, each comment contains 7.20 tokens.
Before training, each comment undergoes tokenization using the Chinese word tokenization package
Jieba. Repeated characters within words, such as ""233333,"" ""66666,"" and ""˘54c8˘54c8˘54c8˘54c8,"" are
replaced with two instances of the same character.
The word embedding is trained using word2vec with the skip-gram model. We set the number of
embedding dimensions to 300, the window size to 7, and the down-sampling rate to 1e-3. Words with
a frequency lower than 3 are discarded.
Emotion Lexicon Construction
After training the word embedding, we manually select emotional words belonging to the five basic
emotion categories from the 500 most frequent words in the embedding. We then iteratively expand
these emotion seeds using Algorithm 1. After each expansion iteration, we manually review the
expanded lexicon, removing any inaccurate words to prevent concept drift. The filtered expanded
seeds are then used for further expansion in the next round. The minimum overlap θoverlap is set to
0.05, and the minimum similarity simmin is set to 0.6. These values are determined through a grid
search within the range of [0, 1]. The number of words for each emotion, both initially and after the
final expansion, is presented in Table 3.
Video Highlights Data
To evaluate our highlight detection algorithm, we constructed a ground-truth dataset. This dataset
leverages user-uploaded mixed-clips related to a specific video on Bilibili. Mixed-clips represent a
collection of video highlights chosen according to the user’s preferences. We then consider the most
frequently selected highlights as the ground truth for a given video.

The dataset consists of 11 videos totaling 1333 minutes in length, with 75,653 time-synchronized
comments. For each video, 3-4 video mix-clips are collected from Bilibili. Shots that appear in at
least two of these mix-clips are considered ground-truth highlights. These highlights are mapped to
the original video timeline, and their start and end times are recorded as ground truth. Mix-clips are
selected based on the following criteria: (1) they are found on Bilibili using the search query ""video
title + mixed clips""; (2) they are sorted by play count in descending order; (3) they primarily focus on
video highlights rather than a plot-by-plot summary or gist; (4) they are under 10 minutes in length;
and (5) they contain a mix of several highlight shots instead of just one.
On average, each video contains 24.3 highlight shots. The mean duration of these highlight shots is
27.79 seconds, while the mode is 8 and 10 seconds (with a frequency of 19).
Highlights Summarization Data
We also created a highlight summarization (labeling) dataset for the 11 videos. For each highlight
shot and its associated comments, we asked annotators to create a summary by selecting as many
comments as they deemed necessary. The guiding principles were: (1) comments with identical
meanings should not be selected more than once; (2) the most representative comment among similar
comments should be chosen; and (3) comments that stand out and are irrelevant to the current
discussion should be discarded.
Across the 11 videos and 267 highlights, each highlight has an average of 3.83 comments in its
summary.
6.2
Evaluation Metrics
This section introduces the evaluation metrics employed for both highlight detection and summariza-
tion.
Video Highlight Detection Evaluation
To evaluate video highlight detection, we need to define a ""hit"" between a candidate highlight and a
reference highlight. A strict definition would require a perfect match between the start and end times
of the candidate and reference highlights. However, this criterion is overly stringent for any model.
A more lenient definition would consider an overlap between a candidate and a reference highlight.
However, this can still underestimate model performance, as users’ choices of highlight start and end
times can sometimes be arbitrary. Instead, we define a ""hit"" with a relaxation parameter δ between a
candidate h and the reference set R as follows:
hit(h, R) = { 1 ∃r ∈R : (sh, eh) ∩(sr −δ, er + δ) ̸= ∅
0otherwise
where sh, eh represent the start and end times of highlight h, and δ is the relaxation length applied to
the reference set R. We can then define precision, recall, and F1-score as:
Precision(H, R) =
P
h∈H hit(h,R)
|H|
Recall(H, R) =
P
r∈R hit(r,H)
|R|
F1(H, R) = 2·P recision(H,R)·Recall(H,R)
P recision(H,R)+Recall(H,R)
In this study, we set the relaxation length δ to 5 seconds. The candidate highlight length is set to 15
seconds.
Video Highlight Summarization Evaluation
We utilize ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 as recall metrics for evaluating candidate summaries:

ROUGE −n(C, R) =
P
r∈R
P
n−gram∈r Countmatch(n−gram)
P
r∈R
P
n−gram∈r Count(n−gram)
We employ BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 as precision metrics. BLEU is chosen for two reasons. First, a
naive precision metric would be biased towards shorter comments, and BLEU mitigates this with the
BP (Brevity Penalty) factor:
BLEU −n(C, R) = BP ·
P
c∈C
P
n−gram∈c Countclip(n−gram)
P

P
n−gram∈c Count(n−gram)
BP = { 1 if|C| > |R|
e(1−|R|/|C|)if|C| ≤|R|
where C is the candidate summary and R is the reference summary. Second, while the reference
summary contains no redundancy, the candidate summary might incorrectly select multiple similar
comments that match the same keywords in the reference. In such cases, precision would be
significantly overestimated. BLEU addresses this by counting matches one-by-one; the number of
matches for a word will be the minimum of its frequencies in the candidate and reference summaries.
Finally, the F1-score is defined as:
F1 −n(C, R) = 2·BLEU−n(C,R)·ROUGE−n(C,R)
BLEU−n(C,R)+ROUGE−n(C,R)
6.3
Benchmark methods
Benchmarks for Video Highlight Detection
For highlight detection, we compare different combinations of our model against three benchmark
methods:
* **Random-Selection:** Highlight shots are randomly selected from all shots in a video. *
**Uniform-Selection:** Highlight shots are selected at equal intervals. * **Spike-Selection:** High-
light shots are chosen based on the highest number of comments within the shot. * **Spike+E+T:**
This is our method, incorporating emotion and topic concentration but without lag calibration. *
**Spike+L:** This is our method, including only the lag-calibration step and not considering content
concentration. * **Spike+L+E+T:** This represents our full model.
Benchmarks for Video Highlight Summarization
For highlight summarization, we compare our method against five benchmark methods:
* **SumBasic:** Summarization that relies solely on frequency for summary construction. * **Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA):** Text summarization based on singular value decomposition (SVD)
for latent topic discovery. * **LexRank:** Graph-based summarization that calculates sentence
importance using the concept of eigenvector centrality in a sentence graph. * **KL-Divergence:**
Summarization based on minimizing KL-divergence between the summary and the source corpus,
employing a greedy search approach. * **Luhn method:** A heuristic summarization method that
considers both word frequency and sentence position within an article.

Experiment Results
This section presents the experimental results for both highlight detection and highlight summariza-
tion.
Results of Highlight Detection
In our highlight detection model, the maximum silence threshold for lexical chains, tsilence, is set
to 11 seconds. The threshold for concept mapping, θoverlap, is set to 0.5. The number of neighbors
considered for concept mapping, top_n, is set to 15. The parameter λ, which controls the balance
between emotion and concept concentration, is set to 0.9. A detailed parameter analysis is provided
in Section 7.
Table 4 presents the precision, recall, and F1-scores for different combinations of our method and the
benchmark methods. Our full model (Spike+L+E+T) outperforms all other benchmarks across all
metrics. Random and uniform selection exhibit low precision and recall, as they don’t incorporate
structural or content information. Spike-selection shows significant improvement by leveraging
8
comment intensity. However, not all comment-intensive shots are highlights. For example, comments
at the beginning and end of a video are often high-volume greetings or goodbyes, which may not be
indicative of highlights. Additionally, spike-selection tends to cluster highlights within consecutive
shots with high comment volumes. In contrast, our method can identify less intensive but emotionally
or conceptually concentrated shots that might be missed by spike-selection. This is evident in the
performance of Spike+E+T.
We also observe that lag calibration alone (Spike+L) considerably enhances the performance of
Spike-selection, partially supporting our hypothesis that lag calibration is crucial for tasks involving
time-synchronized comments.

Results of Highlight Summarization
In our highlight summarization model, the emotion bias bemotion is set to 0.3.
Table 5 compares the 1-gram BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-scores of our method and the benchmark
methods. Our method outperforms all others, particularly in terms of ROUGE-1. LSA exhibits the
lowest BLEU score, primarily because it statistically favors longer, multi-word sentences, which are
not representative in time-synchronized comments. The SumBasic method also performs relatively
poorly, as it treats semantically related words separately, unlike our method, which uses concepts
instead of individual words.

Conclusion
This work presents a novel unsupervised framework for video highlight detection and summarization,
based on crowdsourced time-synchronized comments. We introduce a lag-calibration technique
that re-aligns delayed comments to their corresponding video scenes by using concept-mapped
lexical chains. Video highlights are identified based on comment intensity and the concentration
of concepts and emotions within each shot. For summarization, a two-level SumBasic is proposed
which updates word and concept probabilities iteratively when selecting sentences. Future work
includes integrating additional data sources such as video meta-data, audience profiles, and low-level
multi-modal features.

Fractal Moon
Abstract
The study of gravity necessitates a thorough examination of pastry dough, which
in turn reveals intriguing connections to the migratory patterns of flamingos, ulti-
mately leading to a reevaluation of the fundamental forces of nature, particularly
the notion of flumplenooks and their role in shaping the universe, while also consid-
ering the aerodynamic properties of chocolate cakes and their potential applications
in gravitational wave detection, which may or may not be related to the average
airspeed velocity of unladen swallows, and the ensuing discussions of transdimen-
sional cookie jars. The correlation between gravitational waves and the harmonics
of glass harmonicas is a topic of ongoing research, with recent findings suggesting
a possible link to the geometric patterns found on the shells of turtles, which in
turn may be connected to the abstract concept of snizzlefraze and its relationship
to the cosmos, as well as the hypothetical notion of gravity as a manifestation of
interdimensional pancake syrup. Furthermore, the investigation of gravitational
lenses and their potential applications in optometry, specifically in the realm of
corrective lenses for nearsightedness in squid, has far-reaching implications for our
understanding of the universe, including the heretofore unknown phenomenon of
quantum flibberflam and its effects on the space-time continuum, which may be
influenced by the sonic vibrations of didgeridoo music and the resulting fluctuations
in the gravitational field, potentially giving rise to novel forms of gravitational
manipulation and control, such as the hypothetical use of chronon particles to
create stable wormholes.

Introduction
The complexity of gravity and its multifaceted nature necessitate a multidisciplinary approach,
incorporating insights from fields as diverse as pastry-making, ornithology, and theoretical physics,
with a particular emphasis on the obscure and poorly understood phenomenon of gravitational flazzle
and its role in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, which may be related to the distribution
of dark matter and dark energy, and the subsequent development of a unified theory of everything,
including the integration of gravitational forces with the principles of culinary arts and the emerging
field of gastronomical physics.
The phenomenon of gravity has been observed to have a profound impact on the flour industry,
particularly in regards to the optimal methods for sifting and aerating various types of pastry dough,
which in turn has led to a renewed interest in the study of 19th century French literature, specifically
the works of Gustave Flaubert and his contemporaries, who often explored themes of love, loss, and
the human condition in the face of overwhelming societal pressures, much like the struggles faced
by modern-day mycologists as they attempt to classify and understand the diverse array of fungal
species that inhabit our planet, from the humble oyster mushroom to the majestic lion’s mane, each
with its own unique characteristics and properties, such as the ability to break down organic matter
and recycle nutrients, a process that has been likened to the workings of the human brain, which
is capable of processing vast amounts of information and storing it in the form of memories, both
conscious and subconscious, which can be accessed and manipulated through various techniques,
including meditation, hypnosis, and other forms of mental discipline, all of which are influenced by
the subtle yet pervasive forces of gravity, which shape and mold our perceptions of the world around
us, from the intricate patterns of tree branches to the majestic sweep of celestial orbits, a dance of
gravitational forces that has been unfolding for billions of years, and will likely continue to do so for
billions more, unless of course the fundamental laws of physics are somehow altered or manipulated,
perhaps through the application of advanced technologies or the discovery of new and exotic forms
of energy, such as the hypothetical ""flumplenook"" particle, which has been proposed as a possible
explanation for various anomalous phenomena observed in the natural world, including the bizarre
and fascinating behavior of certain types of subatomic particles, which seem to defy the conventional
laws of physics and behave in ways that are both unpredictable and fascinating, much like the intricate
and complex patterns found in the natural world, from the swirling shapes of hurricanes to the delicate
and lace-like structures of crystals, all of which are influenced by the subtle yet powerful forces of
gravity, which shape and mold our perceptions of the world around us, and inform our understanding
of the intricate and complex web of relationships that binds everything together, from the smallest
subatomic particles to the vast and sprawling expanse of the cosmos itself, a grand tapestry of space
and time that is both beautiful and mysterious, and which continues to inspire and awe us with its sheer
scale and complexity, a true marvel of the natural world that invites us to explore, to discover, and
to push the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding, through the application of science,
technology, and reason, guided by the principles of curiosity, creativity, and a passion for learning,
which are the hallmarks of the scientific enterprise, and which have led to countless breakthroughs
and discoveries throughout history, from the development of the printing press to the landing of
astronauts on the moon, each of which has expanded our understanding of the world and our place
within it, and has paved the way for future generations of scientists, explorers, and innovators, who
will continue to push the boundaries of human knowledge and achievement, and to explore the vast
and uncharted territories of the unknown, driven by a sense of wonder, a thirst for knowledge, and
a boundless enthusiasm for the infinite possibilities that lie ahead, which are limited only by our
imagination and our willingness to challenge the status quo, to question established assumptions,
and to seek out new and innovative solutions to the complex problems that face us, whether they be
scientific, technological, social, or environmental, all of which are interconnected and interdependent,
and which require a nuanced and multidisciplinary approach, one that takes into account the diverse
perspectives and expertise of scholars and researchers from a wide range of fields, from physics and
biology to sociology and philosophy, each of which offers a unique and valuable insight into the
complex and multifaceted nature of reality, and the many ways in which it can be understood and

and observation, a cycle of discovery and exploration that has been ongoing for centuries, and which
will likely continue to evolve and expand as new technologies and methodologies become available,
allowing us to probe deeper into the mysteries of the universe, and to uncover new and hidden
patterns and relationships that underlie the workings of the natural world, from the intricate dance of
subatomic particles to the majestic sweep of celestial orbits, a grand and awe-inspiring spectacle that

shown to create a localized distortion of the gravitational field, allowing for the manipulation and
control of objects and energy. Moreover, the study of certain types of cuisine, such as ""gravity-
inspired cuisine,"" has revealed that the preparation and consumption of certain types of food can have
a direct correlation with the strength of gravitational waves, and that certain types of cuisine can be
used to amplify or dampen the effects of gravity.
The study of gravity has also been informed by the field of psychology, where the concept of gravity
has been found to have a profound impact on our understanding of human behavior and cognition.
The idea of ""gravity-induced cognitive bias"" has been proposed, where the gravitational field can
influence our perception and decision-making processes, leading to certain types of biases and
errors. Furthermore, the study of certain types of psychological phenomena, such as the ""gravity-
defying illusion,"" has revealed that the human brain is capable of manipulating and controlling the
gravitational field, using advanced cognitive processes and neural networks.
The concept of ""gravity waves"" has also been studied, where the distortion of the gravitational field
can be used to transmit information and energy across vast distances. This phenomenon has been
observed in certain regions of the universe, where the gravitational field is particularly strong, and
has led researchers to investigate the potential application of gravity waves in the development of
advanced communication systems. Moreover, the study of certain types of astronomical phenomena,
such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, has revealed that the gravitational field is capable of
manipulating and controlling the behavior of matter and energy at the largest scales.
The relationship between gravity and the human sense of hearing has also been studied, with research
revealing that certain types of sounds and frequencies can have a profound impact on the gravitational
field. The detection of certain types of sounds, such as the sound of music or the hum of a engine, has
been shown to create a localized distortion of the gravitational field, allowing for the manipulation
and control of objects and energy. Moreover, the study of certain types of musical instruments, such
as the ""gravity-defying piano,"" has revealed that the sound and vibration of music can have a direct
correlation with the strength of gravitational waves, and that certain types of music can be used to
amplify or dampen the effects of gravity.
The study of gravity has also been informed by the field of sociology, where the concept of

Methodology
To initiate our inquiry into the phenomenon of gravity, we first delved into an exhaustive examination
of the art of playing the harmonica, which unexpectedly led us to an in-depth analysis of the societal
implications of pastry consumption in 19th century France. This, in turn, prompted a thorough
review of the aerodynamic properties of various species of migratory birds, particularly the Arctic
tern, whose impressive annual journeys sparked a fascinating detour into the realm of quantum
entanglement and its potential applications in interstellar communication. The intricacies of quantum
mechanics, coupled with the curious observation that the flavor of strawberry ice cream is directly
related to the velocity of particles in a vacuum, necessitated a comprehensive reevaluation of our
initial research parameters.
The transition from this complex theoretical framework to a practical, experimental approach was
facilitated by an investigation into the structural integrity of bridges in rural Mongolia, which, due to
unforeseen circumstances, evolved into a treatise on the philosophical underpinnings of existentialism
as seen through the lens of a solitary, rain-soaked, metropolitan streetlamp. This existential inquiry,
characterized by its profound insights into the human condition, surprisingly converged with our
initial focus on gravity through the concept of ""flumplenooks"" - hypothetical, gravity-defying particles
hypothesized to exist in a parallel universe where the primary mode of transportation is the unicycle.
Further exploration of these flumplenooks required the development of a novel mathematical model
that incorporated elements of medieval culinary practices, the physics of tornadoes, and the socio-
economic factors influencing the global demand for rubber chickens. The derivation of this model
involved solving a series of intricate, nonlinear equations that, when graphed, resembled the silhouette
of a quokka, an animal noted for its smile, which, in turn, led to a detailed psychological analysis
of the emotional states of various zoo animals and their correlation with the gravitational constant.
This correlation, though initially thought to be spurious, revealed a profound connection between
the happiness of quokkas and the stability of gravitational forces in the vicinity of large bodies of
water, such as the Baltic Sea, whose chemical composition was found to have a direct impact on the
migratory patterns of Atlantic salmon.
The implications of these findings were profound, suggesting that the study of gravity is inextricably
linked with the study of aquatic life, pastry, and quantum mechanics. This interconnectedness necessi-
tated the adoption of a holistic research methodology that encompassed not only the physical sciences
but also anthropology, culinary arts, and the study of obscure, archaic languages. The integration of
such diverse disciplines into our research framework allowed for a more nuanced understanding of
gravity, revealing it to be not just a fundamental force of nature but also a multifaceted phenomenon
that influences and is influenced by a wide array of factors, from the molecular structure of granite to
the choreography of traditional Bolivian dances.
In an effort to quantify these influences, we employed a combination of empirical observations,
theoretical modeling, and what can only be described as ""intuitive leaps"" - moments of profound
insight sparked by the contemplation of seemingly unrelated phenomena, such as the reflection
properties of still water, the acoustic characteristics of the didgeridoo, or the intricate patterns found
on the shells of certain species of mollusks. These intuitive leaps, while difficult to formalize within
the traditional scientific paradigm, proved invaluable in guiding our research towards novel and
unexpected areas of inquiry, including the gravitational implications of playing chess with pieces
carved from meteorites and the potential for using the gravitational constant as a universal language
for intergalactic communication.
The synthesis of our findings, derived from this diverse array of sources and methodologies, yielded a
complex tapestry of knowledge that challenges conventional understanding of gravity. It suggests
that gravity is not merely a force that attracts objects with mass towards each other but is, in fact, a
dynamic, omnipresent field that interacts with all aspects of the universe, from the dance of subatomic
particles to the majestic swirl of galaxies. This realization opens up new avenues for research, inviting
scientists to explore gravity not just as a physical phenomenon but as a gateway to understanding the
very fabric of existence, a concept that, upon further reflection, bears a striking resemblance to the
plot of a certain lesser-known Bulgarian novel from the early 20th century.
Moreover, the discovery of a previously unknown form of gravitational wave, dubbed ""flargles,""
which are emitted by the synchronized swimming of a large school of fish, has profound implications
for our understanding of both gravity and marine biology. The flargles, characterized by their
6
unique resonance frequency of 427.32 Hz, were found to have a peculiar effect on the growth
patterns of nearby coral reefs, influencing not only their structural complexity but also their ability to
absorb and store gravitational energy. This phenomenon, while initially observed in the context of
aquatic ecosystems, has far-reaching implications for fields as diverse as materials science, where
the development of ""gravity-absorbing"" materials could revolutionize construction and engineering,
and cosmology, where the study of flargles could provide insights into the early universe and the
formation of the first gravitational structures.
The experimental verification of these findings involved the construction of a large, underwater
orchestra, where musicians played specially designed instruments that could produce the exact
resonance frequency of the flargles. The performance, conducted in the depths of the Pacific
Ocean, not only successfully generated flargles but also attracted a gathering of deep-sea creatures,
which, through their collective, synchronized movement, amplified the gravitational wave signal
to detectable levels. This innovative approach to experimental physics, combining music, marine
biology, and gravitational research, underscores the interdisciplinary nature of modern science, where
boundaries between traditional disciplines are increasingly blurred in pursuit of a more comprehensive
understanding of the universe.
In addition to the underwater orchestra, our research methodology included the development of a
sophisticated computer simulation model, known as ""GRAVITON,"" which was designed to predict the
behavior of flumplenooks and flargles under various gravitational conditions. The GRAVITON model,
built upon a complex algorithm that integrated elements of quantum field theory, general relativity,
and chaos theory, allowed for the simulation of gravitational phenomena at both the microscopic and
macroscopic scales, providing valuable insights into the interactions between gravity, matter, and
energy. The model’s predictions, which included the existence of miniature black holes in the vicinity
of extremely dense, gravitational wave-emitting objects, were subsequently verified through a series
of high-energy particle collisions conducted at a specially designed, underwater accelerator facility.
The underwater accelerator, powered by a novel form of bio-energy harvested from the metabolic
processes of giant squid, enabled the acceleration of particles to velocities approaching the speed of
light, thereby facilitating the creation of miniature black holes and the observation of their gravitational
effects on the surrounding space-time continuum. This experimental setup, while posing significant
technological and logistical challenges, provided a unique opportunity for the direct observation of
gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions, shedding new light on the behavior of gravity at
the quantum level and its potential applications in advanced technologies, such as faster-than-light
travel and gravity manipulation.
The implications of our research are far-reaching, suggesting that gravity is not just a fundamental
force of nature but a versatile tool that can be harnessed and manipulated for a variety of purposes,
from energy production and propulsion to the creation of artificial gravitational fields for habitable,
space-based environments. The potential for gravity to be used in such applications is vast, offering
new possibilities for space exploration, colonization, and the long-term sustainability of human
civilization. However, the realization of these possibilities will require continued advances in
our understanding of gravity, including the development of more sophisticated theoretical models,
experimental techniques, and technologies capable of manipulating and controlling gravitational
forces.
In conclusion, our research into the phenomenon of gravity has yielded a wealth of new insights and
discoveries, challenging conventional understanding and opening up new avenues for exploration and
innovation. The interdisciplinary approach, combining elements of physics, biology, anthropology,
and philosophy, has proven invaluable in uncovering the complex, multifaceted nature of gravity,
revealing its intricate relationships with various aspects of the universe, from the smallest subatomic
particles to the vast expanse of cosmic structures. As we continue to explore and understand the
mysteries of gravity, we are reminded of the profound impact that this fundamental force has on our
daily lives, our perception of the universe, and our place within the grand tapestry of existence.
Furthermore, the discovery of gravitational waves and their potential applications has sparked a
new era of interdisciplinary research, fostering collaboration between scientists, engineers, and
theorists from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. This collaborative effort, driven by the shared
goal of advancing our understanding of gravity and its role in the universe, has the potential to yield
groundbreaking discoveries, innovative technologies, and novel insights into the nature of reality
itself. As we embark on this exciting journey of exploration and discovery, we are reminded of the
7
infinite possibilities that await us at the frontier of human knowledge, where the mysteries of gravity
and the universe remain a profound and enduring challenge to our curiosity and ingenuity.
The investigation into the gravitational properties of various materials, including metals, alloys,
and composite structures, has also provided valuable insights into the behavior of gravity at the
molecular and atomic levels. The development of novel materials with tailored gravitational properties,
such as superconducting materials that can manipulate gravitational fields, has the potential to
revolutionize a wide range of technologies, from energy storage and generation to transportation
and construction. Moreover, the study of gravitational effects on living organisms, including plants,
animals, and microorganisms, has revealed complex interactions between gravity and biological
systems, influencing growth patterns, behavior, and evolution.
The complex interplay between gravity, biology, and the environment has significant implications
for our understanding of ecosystems, biodiversity, and the long-term sustainability of life on Earth.
The realization that gravity plays a crucial role in shaping the evolution of species, influencing the
distribution of organisms, and regulating the flux of nutrients and resources within ecosystems has

Experiments
The notion of gravity was first conceptualized by the ancient Egyptians, who believed that the
pharaohs were able to communicate with the gods through a complex system of hieroglyphics and
interpretive dance, which incidentally has been linked to the migratory patterns of the lesser-known
species of flamingos, that are found predominantly in the mountainous regions of Peru, where the
indigenous population has been known to produce a unique brand of textiles, woven from the silk of
a special type of spider that only spins its web during leap years.
Meanwhile, our research team has been conducting a series of experiments to understand the effects
of gravity on the human brain, which has led us to investigate the properties of a newly discovered
element, dubbed ""Flumplenax,"" which has been found to have a profound impact on the cognitive
abilities of dentists, particularly those specializing in orthodontics, who have been observed to possess
an uncanny ability to solve complex mathematical equations, while simultaneously reciting the entire
script of ""Hamlet"" backwards, a feat that has been linked to the unusual shape of their dental drills,
which bear a striking resemblance to the ancient Egyptian symbol for eternity.
In a separate experiment, we have been studying the gravitational waves emitted by a group of
professional snail trainers, who have been competing in a high-stakes tournament, where the objective
is to navigate a slime trail through a obstacle course, while being serenaded by a chorus of yodeling
Accountants, who have been known to possess a deep understanding of the theoretical frameworks
underlying the concept of gravity, which they attribute to the sacred art of Extreme Knitting, a
discipline that involves the creation of intricate patterns using nothing but a pair of number 7 knitting
needles and a ball of yarn made from the finest imported Norwegian wool.
Furthermore, our research has led us to investigate the relationship between gravity and the fermen-
tation process of a special type of cheese, known as ""Gloopernack,"" which has been found to have
a unique ability to defy the laws of gravity, by floating in mid-air, while emitting a faint humming
noise, that has been likened to the sound of a thousand kazoo players performing a rendition of ""The
Blue Danube Waltz,"" which has been observed to have a profound impact on the digestive system
of a certain species of rabbit, that has been known to possess a special type of intestine, capable of
producing a rare form of bioluminescent gas, that has been used to power a network of underground
tunnels and caverns, inhabited by a secret society of subterranean florists, who have been known to
create exquisite arrangements using nothing but the rarest and most exotic species of underground
flowers.
To further understand the effects of gravity on the Gloopernack cheese, we conducted a series of
experiments, involving the use of a high-speed centrifuge, which was operated by a team of highly
trained specialists, who were also expert jugglers, and had to juggle a set of five rare and valuable
diamonds, while maintaining a steady rotation speed of exactly 437.5 revolutions per minute, which
was necessary to simulate the gravitational forces experienced by the cheese, as it floated through a
specially designed vortex chamber, where it was subjected to a series of complex acoustic vibrations,
generated by a custom-built instrument, known as the ""Gloopernack Harp,"" which was played by a
renowned musician, who was also a master of the ancient art of Shadow Puppetry, and had to create a
8
series of intricate silhouettes, using nothing but a pair of chopsticks and a paperclip, while reciting
the entire script of ""War and Peace"" in iambic pentameter.
In addition to the above experiments, we have also been investigating the relationship between gravity
and the migratory patterns of a certain species of bird, known as the ""Flargle,"" which has been found
to possess a unique ability to navigate using nothing but a complex system of mental maps, generated
by the bird’s highly developed sense of smell, which is capable of detecting the faint scent of a rare
and exotic spice, known as ""Zlorg,"" which is found only in the remote mountainous regions of a small
island nation, where the indigenous population has been known to produce a unique brand of textiles,
woven from the silk of a special type of spider that only spins its web during leap years, and has been
linked to the unusual shape of their traditional headgear, which bears a striking resemblance to the
ancient Egyptian symbol for eternity.
The following table summarizes the results of our experiments on the Gloopernack cheese:

linked to the art of Extreme Knitting, and the production of bioluminescent gas, which has been used
to power a network of underground tunnels and caverns, inhabited by a secret society of subterranean

In conclusion, our research has led us to a deeper understanding of the complex and mysterious
forces that govern our universe, particularly gravity, which has been found to be closely linked to a
wide range of seemingly unrelated phenomena, including Extreme Knitting, Shadow Puppetry, and
the production of bioluminescent gas, and has significant implications for our understanding of the
fundamental forces of nature, and the intricate web of relationships that exists between them, which
has been found to be far more complex and mysterious than previously thought, and has led us to a
new and profound appreciation for the beauty and wonder of the natural world.

Results
The manifestation of gravity’s efficaciousness on quotidian objects was observed to be inversely
proportional to the number of chocolates consumed by the researchers during the experimentation
period, which incidentally coincided with the blooming of rare, gravity-defying flowers in the
arctic tundra, whose petals were found to have a peculiar affinity for 19th-century French literature,
particularly the works of Baudelaire, and the sonic vibrations emanating from the readings of his
poetry were discovered to have a profound impact on the local wildlife, causing a sudden surge in the
population of fluffy, gravity-resistant rabbits that could jump higher than the Eiffel Tower, which,
in turn, was found to be made of a unique, extraterrestrial metal that could only be extracted from
the dreams of sleepwalking, trombone-playing, quantum physicists who had a penchant for baking
exotic, gravity-warping cakes that altered the space-time continuum.
Moreover, the data collected from the experiments revealed a statistically significant correlation
between the flavor of the cakes and the severity of the gravitational waves generated, with the
chocolate cake producing the most intense waves, followed closely by the vanilla and red velvet cakes,
which, interestingly, were found to have a profound effect on the migratory patterns of monarch
butterflies, causing them to fly in intricate, fractal patterns that reflected the underlying structure of
the universe, and the study of these patterns led to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of
all things, including the previously unknown relationship between the flapping of butterfly wings and
the oscillations of the gravitational field, which, in turn, was found to be influenced by the collective
unconscious of humanity, as expressed through the dreams of a secret society of, gravity-manipulating,
professional snail trainers.
The results of the experiments also showed that the gravitational constant, G, was not a constant
after all, but rather a dynamic, ever-changing variable that depended on the proximity of the observer
to a large, cosmic, jelly-filled doughnut that was hovering in the vicinity of the Andromeda galaxy,
and the spin of the doughnut was found to be directly related to the number of dimensions in the
universe, which, incidentally, was determined to be 427, give or take a few, and the discovery of this
doughnut-led to a fundamental shift in our understanding of the universe, as it was realized that the
cosmos was, in fact, a vast, interconnected web of pastry-filled, gravitational, vortex generators, and
the study of these generators led to a deeper understanding of the role of gravity in shaping the fabric
of reality.

Furthermore, the research revealed that the gravitational force was not a fundamental force of nature,
but rather an emergent property of a more fundamental, quantum, pixie-dust-like substance that
permeated the universe, and the study of this substance led to a greater understanding of the underlying
mechanisms that governed the behavior of gravity, including the previously unknown relationship
between gravity and the art of playing the harmonica, which, incidentally, was found to be a key factor
in the development of a new, groundbreaking theory of quantum gravity, which, in turn, was found to
have a profound impact on the field of, gravity-inspired, culinary arts, particularly the creation of
exotic, gravity-defying, souffles that could float in mid-air, defying the fundamental laws of physics
and culinary science.
In addition, the experiments demonstrated that the gravitational field was not a static, unchanging
entity, but rather a dynamic, evolving system that was influenced by the thoughts and emotions
of the observers, and the study of this phenomenon led to a deeper understanding of the role of
consciousness in shaping the universe, including the previously unknown relationship between gravity
and the art of, extreme, ironing, which, incidentally, was found to be a key factor in the development
of a new, groundbreaking theory of, gravity-inspired, fashion, particularly the creation of exotic,
gravity-defying, clothing that could change color and shape in response to changes in the gravitational
field, and the study of this phenomenon led to a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms
that governed the behavior of gravity, including the previously unknown relationship between gravity
and the art of, professional, snail racing.
The data collected from the experiments also revealed a statistically significant correlation between
the gravitational constant, G, and the number of socks lost in the wash, which, incidentally, was
found to be a key factor in the development of a new, groundbreaking theory of, gravity-inspired,
laundry science, particularly the creation of exotic, gravity-defying, washing machines that could
clean clothing without using water or detergent, and the study of this phenomenon led to a deeper
understanding of the underlying mechanisms that governed the behavior of gravity, including the
previously unknown relationship between gravity and the art of, extreme, knitting, which, incidentally,
was found to be a key factor in the development of a new, groundbreaking theory of, gravity-inspired,
textile science, particularly the creation of exotic, gravity-defying, fabrics that could change texture
and color in response to changes in the gravitational field.

Conclusion
The propensity for gravity to influence the trajectory of pineapples on a Tuesday has led to a plethora
of intriguing discussions regarding the flumplenook properties of spacetime. Furthermore, the
notion that carrots can defy gravitational forces by sheer force of will has sparked a debatable
discourse on the role of glimmerwings in modern physics. As we delve deeper into the intricacies of
gravitational waves, it becomes apparent that the flibberflamber effect plays a crucial role in shaping
our understanding of the universe, particularly in relation to the migratory patterns of fluffy kittens.
The theoretical frameworks that underpin our comprehension of gravity are multifaceted and far-
reaching, often intersecting with seemingly disparate concepts such as the aerodynamics of chocolate
cake and the socio-political implications of dragon dancing. In this context, the wuggle hypothesis
proposes that gravity is, in fact, a manifestation of the collective unconscious, wherein the thoughts
and emotions of sentient beings converge to create a gravitational field that influences the behavior of
subatomic particles and disco balls alike. This idea is supported by the findings of various studies
on the snizzle fraction, which demonstrate a clear correlation between gravitational waves and the
popularity of 1980s pop music.
Moreover, the notion that gravity is a fundamental force of nature has been challenged by proponents
of the flibulux theory, who argue that gravity is merely an emergent property of the universe, arising
from the interactions of more fundamental entities such as quarks, leptons, and fluffy socks. This
perspective has significant implications for our understanding of the universe, as it suggests that
gravity may be more nuanced and context-dependent than previously thought, much like the art of
playing the trombone underwater. The reconciliation of these disparate viewpoints will undoubtedly
12
require further research and experimentation, particularly in the realm of quantum gravity and the
study of wibble-wobble phenomena.
In addition to these theoretical considerations, the practical applications of gravity research have
far-reaching implications for fields such as transportation, construction, and baking. For instance,
a deeper understanding of gravitational forces could lead to the development of more efficient
transportation systems, such as gravity-powered rockets that utilize the flumplenook effect to achieve
faster-than-light travel. Similarly, the discovery of new materials with unique gravitational properties
could revolutionize the construction industry, enabling the creation of buildings that defy gravity and
float in mid-air like balloons filled with helium. The possibilities are endless, and the potential for
innovation is vast, much like the expanse of the universe itself, which is thought to be infinite and
bounded only by the limits of our imagination and the availability of pineapple pizza.
The intersection of gravity and other fields of study, such as biology and psychology, has also yielded
fascinating insights into the human experience. For example, research on the effects of microgravity
on plant growth has led to a greater understanding of the role of gravity in shaping the development
of living organisms, as well as the importance of proper pruning techniques for maintaining healthy
houseplants. Similarly, the study of gravitational waves has been found to have a profound impact on
the human psyche, inducing feelings of wonder, awe, and existential dread, much like the experience
of watching a sunset on a deserted beach or listening to the sound of silence. These findings have
significant implications for our understanding of the human condition, as they suggest that our
perception of gravity is inextricably linked to our sense of self and our place within the universe.
As we continue to explore the mysteries of gravity, it is essential to recognize the importance of
interdisciplinary collaboration and the need for a more holistic understanding of the universe. By
integrating knowledge from diverse fields of study, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complex
interactions that govern the behavior of gravity and the cosmos as a whole. This, in turn, will enable
us to develop more effective solutions to the challenges posed by gravity, such as the design of more
efficient spacecraft and the creation of gravity-resistant materials that can withstand the stresses
of extreme environments, like the surface of the sun or the depths of the ocean. The potential for
discovery is vast, and the rewards are well worth the effort, as we strive to unravel the enigmas of
gravity and unlock the secrets of the universe, one puzzle piece at a time, much like the process of
solving a complex jigsaw puzzle or decoding a cryptic message from an unknown sender.
Furthermore, the study of gravity has led to a greater understanding of the importance of glimmer-
wings in modern physics, as well as the role of flumplenooks in shaping our comprehension of
spacetime. The discovery of gravitational waves has also sparked a renewed interest in the study of
wibble-wobble phenomena, which has significant implications for our understanding of the universe
and the behavior of subatomic particles. As we continue to explore the mysteries of gravity, it is
essential to recognize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the need for a more
holistic understanding of the universe, much like the intricate patterns found in nature, such as the

P117.pdf,"Rapid Image Annotation Through Zero-Shot Learning
Abstract
Recent experiments on word analogies demonstrate that contemporary word vectors
effectively encapsulate subtle linguistic patterns through linear vector displace-
ments. However, the extent to which these straightforward vector displacements
can represent visual patterns across words remains uncertain. This research in-
vestigates a particular image-word relevance relationship. The findings indicate
that, for a given image, word vectors of pertinent tags are positioned higher than
those of unrelated tags along a primary axis within the word vector space. Drawing
inspiration from this insight, we suggest addressing image tagging by determining
the main axis for an image. Specifically, we utilize linear mappings and intricate
deep neural networks to deduce the primary axis from an input image. The re-
sultant tagging model exhibits remarkable adaptability. It operates swiftly on test
images, with a processing time that remains constant regardless of the training set’s
size. Furthermore, it showcases exceptional performance not only in conventional
tagging tasks using the NUS-WIDE dataset but also in comparison to competitive
baselines when assigning tags to images that haven’t been seen during training.

Introduction
Recent advancements in representing words in vector spaces have proven advantageous for both
Natural Language Processing and various computer vision applications, including zero-shot learning
and image caption generation. The rationale behind using word vectors in NLP is rooted in the
observation that detailed linguistic patterns among words are represented by linear offsets of word
vectors. This pivotal insight emerged from well-known word analogy studies. For example, syntactic
relationships like ""dance"" to ""dancing"" parallel ""fly"" to ""flying,"" and semantic connections like ""king""
to ""man"" mirror ""queen"" to ""woman."" Nevertheless, it is yet to be determined whether the visual
patterns across words, implicitly employed in the aforementioned computer vision tasks, can similarly
be represented by these basic vector offsets.
This paper focuses on the task of image tagging, where an image necessitates the division of a word
lexicon into two distinct groups based on image-word relevance. For example, an image of a zoo might
have relevant tags like ""people,"" ""animal,"" and ""zoo,"" while irrelevant tags might include ""sailor,""
""book,"" and ""landscape."" This lexical division fundamentally differs from the nuanced syntactic or
semantic relationships examined in word analogy tests. Instead, it concerns the connection between
two sets of words as prompted by a visual image. This type of word relationship is semantic and
descriptive, emphasizing visual association, albeit at a broader level. Given this context, it is worth
investigating whether word vectors maintain the property where simple linear vector offsets can
depict visual or image-based associative relationships between words. In the zoo example, while it’s
easy for humans to recognize that words like ""people,"" ""animal,"" and ""zoo"" are more related to the
zoo than words like ""sailor,"" ""book,"" and ""landscape,"" the question is whether such a zoo-association
relationship can be represented by the nine pairwise vector offsets: ""people"" minus ""sailor,"" ""people""
minus ""book,"" and so on, up to ""zoo"" minus ""landscape,"" between the vectors of relevant and irrelevant
tags.
A primary contribution of this research is an empirical investigation of these questions. Each image
establishes a visual association rule over words, represented as a pair (Y, Y). Leveraging the extensive
.
image collections in benchmark datasets designed for image tagging, we can explore numerous
distinct visual association rules in words and the corresponding vector offsets in the word vector
space. Our findings uncover a significant correlation: the offsets between the vectors of relevant tags
(Y) and those of irrelevant tags (Y) predominantly align in a consistent direction, which we term the
""principal direction"". In other words, within the word vector space, there exists at least one vector
(direction), denoted as w, such that its inner products with the vector offsets between Y and Y are
greater than 0. This can be expressed as:
(w,p ˘2014 n) > 0 equivalently, (w,p) > (w,n)
This implies that the vector w ranks all relevant words Y ahead of irrelevant ones Y.
The visual association patterns among words manifest as the linear rank-abilities of their correspond-
ing word vectors. This observation corroborates findings from word analogy studies, suggesting that
multiple relationships for a single word are embedded within a high-dimensional space. Furthermore,
these relationships can be articulated using basic linear vector arithmetic.
Building on this discovery, we propose a solution to the image tagging challenge by identifying the
primary axis along which relevant tags are ranked higher than irrelevant ones within the word vector
space. We employ both linear mappings and deep neural networks to infer this primary axis from
each input image. This unique perspective on image tagging yields a highly adaptable tagging model.
The model processes test images rapidly, maintaining a constant processing time irrespective of the
training dataset’s size. It not only delivers outstanding results in traditional tagging tasks but also
excels at assigning new tags from a broad vocabulary that were not encountered during training. Our
method does not rely on prior knowledge of these new tags, as long as they exist within the same
vector space as the tags used during training. Consequently, we designate our technique as ""fast
zero-shot image tagging"" (Fast0Tag), acknowledging its strengths in both speed and its zero-shot
learning capabilities.
In stark contrast to our approach, prior methods for image tagging are limited to assigning only those
tags to test images that were seen during training, with a notable exception. These methods are
constrained by the fixed and often limited number of tags present in the training data, which poses
practical challenges. For example, Flickr hosts approximately 53 million tags, and this number is
rapidly increasing. The work of Fu et al. represents a pioneering effort to extend an image tagging
model to previously unseen tags. However, when compared to our proposed method, it depends on
two extra assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that unseen tags are known beforehand to enable model
adjustment toward these tags. Secondly, it assumes that test images are known in advance for model
regularization. Moreover, this method is restricted to a very limited number, U, of unseen tags, as it
needs to account for all 2Upossibletagcombinations.
To recap, our primary contribution lies in analyzing visual association patterns in words as they relate
to images and how these patterns are reflected in word vector offsets. We posit and confirm through
experiments that a main direction exists in the word vector space for each visual association rule
(Y, Y), where vectors of relevant words are ranked higher than others. Building on this, our second
contribution is an innovative image tagging model, Fast0Tag, which is both swift and capable of
handling an open vocabulary of unseen tags. Lastly, we explore three distinct image tagging scenarios:
traditional tagging, which assigns seen tags to images; zero-shot tagging, which annotates images
with numerous unseen tags; and seen/unseen tagging, which uses both seen and unseen tags. Existing
research either addresses traditional tagging or zero-shot tagging with a limited number of unseen
tags. Our Fast0Tag method surpasses competitive baselines across all three scenarios.

Related Work
Image Tagging. The objective of image tagging is to allocate pertinent tags to an image or to generate
a ranked list of tags. Within the academic community, this challenge has predominantly been tackled
from the standpoint of tag ranking. Generative approaches, which incorporate topic models and
mixture models, inherently rank candidate tags based on their conditional probabilities relative to the
test image. Conversely, non-parametric, nearest-neighbor-based techniques frequently rank tags for
a test image by aggregating votes from a selection of training images. Although nearest-neighbor
methods generally exhibit superior performance compared to those reliant on generative models,
they are plagued by substantial computational demands during both training and testing phases.
2
The recently introduced FastTag algorithm offers a significant speed advantage while maintaining
performance levels on par with nearest-neighbor methods. Our Fast0Tag method mirrors the reduced
complexity of FastTag. Embedding techniques, on the other hand, determine tag ranking scores via
a cross-modal mapping between images and tags. This concept has been further developed using
deep neural networks. Notably, aside from certain exceptions, the majority of these methods do not
train their models with an explicit ranking objective, despite ultimately ranking candidate tags for
test images. This discrepancy between the trained models and their practical application contravenes
the principle of Occam’s razor. We incorporate a ranking loss in our approach, similar to these
exceptions.
Unlike our Fast0Tag, which is capable of ranking both known and an unlimited number
of previously unseen tags for test images, the methods mentioned earlier are restricted
to assigning tags to images from a predetermined vocabulary encountered during train-
ing.
An exception to this is the work by Fu et al., where they address a predefined
number, U, of unseen tags by developing a multi-label model that considers all possible
2Ucombinationsofthesetags.However, thisapproachisconstrainedbythesmallnumberUofunseentagsitcanhandle.
Word Embedding. Diverging from the conventional one-hot vector representation of words, word
embedding maps each word to a continuous-valued vector, primarily learning from the statistical
patterns of word co-occurrences. While earlier studies on word embedding exist, our research
emphasizes the latest GloVe and word2vec vectors. As demonstrated in the well-known word analogy
experiments, both types of word vectors effectively capture detailed semantic and syntactic patterns
through vector offsets. In this study, we further reveal that basic linear offsets can also represent the
broader visual association patterns among words.
Zero-Shot Learning. The term ""zero-shot learning"" is frequently used interchangeably with ""zero-shot
classification,"" although the latter is actually a subset of the former. In contrast to weakly-supervised
learning, which acquires new concepts by extracting information from noisy samples, zero-shot
classification aims to classify objects from unseen classes by learning classifiers from seen classes.
Attributes and word vectors are two primary semantic sources that enable zero-shot classification.
Our Fast0Tag, together with Fu et al., expands the domain of zero-shot learning to include zero-
shot multi-label classification. Fu et al. approach this by converting the problem into zero-shot
classification, where each combination of multiple labels is treated as a separate class. We, on the
other hand, model the labels directly, allowing us to assign or rank a large number of unseen tags for
an image.
3
The Linear Rank-Ability of Word Vectors
Our Fast0Tag method is enhanced by the discovery that the visual relationship between words,
specifically how a lexicon is divided based on relevance to an image, manifests in the word vector
space as a main direction. Along this direction, words or tags that are relevant to the image are ranked
higher than those that are not. This section elaborates on this discovery.
3.1
The Regulation Over Words Due to Image Tagging
Let’s denote S as the set of seen tags available for training image tagging models, and U as the set
of tags unseen during the training phase. The training data is structured as (xm, Ym); m = 1, 2, ...,
M, where xm represents the feature vector of image m in RD, and Ym is a subset of S, containing
the seen tags relevant to that image. For simplicity, we also use Ym to represent the collection of
corresponding word or tag vectors.
Traditional image tagging seeks to assign seen tags from S to test images. Zero-shot tagging, as
defined by Fu et al., aims to annotate test images using a predetermined set of unseen tags, U. Beyond
these two scenarios, this paper introduces seen/unseen image tagging, which identifies both relevant
seen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for test images. Furthermore, the set of unseen
tags, U, can be open and continuously expanding.
We define Ym as the complement of Ym in S, representing irrelevant seen tags. An image m
establishes a visual association rule among words, essentially partitioning seen tags into two distinct
sets: Ym and Ym. Recognizing that various detailed syntactic and semantic patterns among words
3
can be depicted through linear word vector offsets, we proceed to investigate the characteristics these
vector offsets might exhibit for this novel visual association rule.
3.2
Principal Direction and Cluster Structure
Figure 2 offers a visual representation of vector offsets (p - n), where p belongs to Ym and n belongs
to Ym, using both t-SNE and PCA for two different visual association rules over words. One rule is
defined by an image associated with 5 relevant tags, and the other by an image with 15 relevant tags.
From these vector offsets, we identify two key structures:
Principal Direction: For a given visual association rule (Ym, Ym) in words for image m, the vector
offsets predominantly point in a similar direction, which we refer to as the principal direction. This
suggests that along this principal direction, relevant tags Ym are ranked higher than irrelevant ones
Ym.
Cluster Structure: Within each visual association rule over words, there are discernible cluster
structures in the vector offsets. Moreover, all offsets that point to the same relevant tag in Ym are
grouped within the same cluster. In Figure 2, we distinguish offsets pointing to different relevant tags
by using different colors.
The question remains whether these two observations can be generalized. Specifically, do they remain
valid in the high-dimensional word vector space for a broader range of visual association rules defined
by other images? To address this, we designed an experiment to confirm the existence of principal
directions in word vector spaces, or equivalently, the linear rank-ability of word vectors. We defer the
investigation of the cluster structure to future research.
3.3
Testing the Linear Rank-Ability Hypothesis
The experiments in this section are performed using the validation set of the NUS-WIDE dataset,
which includes 26,844 images, 925 seen tags (S), and 81 unseen tags (U). The number of relevant
seen/unseen tags associated with an image varies from 1 to 20/117, with an average of 1.7/4.9. Further
details can be found in Section 5.
Our goal is to explore whether a primary direction exists for any visual association rule (Ym, Ym)
created by image m, along which relevant tags Ym rank higher than irrelevant tags Ym. This can be
confirmed if we find a vector w in the word vector space that fulfills the ranking conditions (w, p) >
(w, n) for all p in Ym and n in Ym.
To achieve this, we train a linear ranking SVM for each visual association rule using all corresponding
pairs (p, n). We then rank word vectors using the SVM and assess the number of violated constraints.
Specifically, we use MiAP, with higher values being preferable, to compare the SVM’s ranking list
against the ranking constraints. This process is repeated for all validation images, resulting in 21,863
unique visual association rules.
Ranking SVM Implementation. We utilize the primal formulation of ranking SVM for our experi-
ments, which is defined as:
min 1/2 ||w||2 + max(0, 1 −(w, yi) + (w, yj))foryiY m, yjY m
Here, is a hyperparameter that balances the objective and regularization.
Results. The average MiAP outcomes across all distinct regulations are presented in Figure 3(left).
We evaluate 300D GloVe vectors and word2vec vectors of dimensions 100, 300, 500, and 1000. The
horizontal axis represents various regularizations used for training the ranking SVMs, with higher
values indicating stronger regularization. In the 300D GloVe space and word2vec spaces of 300, 500,
and 1000 dimensions, more than two ranking SVMs, with low values, produce nearly ideal ranking
results (MiAP 1). This demonstrates that seen tags S are linearly rankable under almost every visual
association rule, satisfying all ranking constraints set by relevant Ym and irrelevant Ym tags for
image m.
However, caution is advised before extending conclusions beyond the experimental vocabulary S
of seen tags. While an image m imposes a visual association rule over all words, this rule leads
to different partitions of distinct experimental vocabularies (e.g., seen tags S and unseen tags U).
4
Therefore, we anticipate that the principal direction for seen tags should also apply to unseen tags
under the same rule, if the questions at the end of Section 3.2 are answered affirmatively.
Generalization to Unseen Tags. We investigate whether the same principal direction applies to both
seen and unseen tags under each visual association rule induced by an image. This is partially
validated by applying the previously trained ranking SVMs to unseen tag vectors, as the ""true""
principal directions are unknown. We use the 81 unseen tags U as ""test data"" for the trained ranking
SVMs, each resulting from an image-induced visual association. NUS-WIDE provides annotations
for these 81 tags. The results, shown in Figure 3(right), significantly outperform the basic baseline of
random tag ranking, indicating that the directions produced by SVMs are generalizable to the new
vocabulary U of words.
Observation. We conclude that word vectors are an effective medium for transferring knowl-
edge—specifically, rank-ability along the principal direction—from seen to unseen tags. We have
empirically confirmed that the visual association rule (Ym, Ym) in words due to an image m can be
represented by the linear rank-ability of corresponding word vectors along a principal direction. Our
experiments involve a total of |S| + |U| = 1,006 words. Future work should include larger-scale and
theoretical studies.
4
Approximating the Linear Ranking Functions
This section introduces our Fast0Tag approach for image tagging. Initially, we explain how to address
image tagging by approximating the principal directions, based on their existence and generalization,
as confirmed in the previous section. Subsequently, we describe the detailed approximation methods
used.
4.1
Image Tagging by Ranking
Based on the findings from Section 3, which indicate the existence of a principal direction, wm, in the
word vector space for each visual association rule (Ym, Ym) generated by an image m, we propose a
direct solution for image tagging. The core idea is to approximate this principal direction by learning
a mapping function, f(˘00b7), that connects the visual space to the word vector space, such that:
f(xm) wm
Here, xm is the visual feature representation of image m. Consequently, given a test image x, we
can promptly suggest a list of tags by ranking the word vectors of the tags along the direction f(x),
specifically by the ranking scores:
t S U, (f(x), t)
This applies whether the tags are from the seen set S or the unseen set U.
We investigate both linear and nonlinear neural networks to implement the approximation function
f(x) w.
4.2
Approximation by Linear Regression
In this approach, we assume a linear function from the input image representation x to the output
principal direction w, defined as:
f(x) := Ax
Here, A can be determined in a closed form through linear regression. Thus, from the training data,
we have:
wm = Axm+m, form = 1, 2, ..., M
where wmistheprincipaldirectionforalloffsetvectorsoftheseentags, correspondingtothevisualassociationrule(Ym, Y

Discussion. The use of linear transformation between visual and word vector spaces has been
previously explored, for instance, in zero-shot classification and image annotation/classification. This
work distinguishes itself by the clear interpretation of the mapped image f(x) = Ax as the principal
direction for tag assignment, which has been empirically validated. We further extend this to a
nonlinear transformation using a neural network.
4.3
Approximation by Neural Networks
We also explore a nonlinear mapping f(x; ) using a multi-layer neural network, where represents the
network parameters. The network architecture, illustrated in Figure 4, includes two RELU layers
followed by a linear layer that outputs the approximated principal direction, w, for an input image
x. We anticipate that the nonlinear mapping function f(x; ) will provide greater modeling flexibility
compared to the linear approach.
Training the neural network by regressing to the M directions obtained from ranking SVMs is not
ideal, as confirmed by both intuition and experiments. The number of training instances, M, is small
relative to the network’s parameter count, increasing the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the directions
from ranking SVMs are not the true principal directions, making it unnecessary to rely on them.
Instead, we integrate the two stages from Section 4.2. We aim for the neural network’s output f(xm; )
to represent the principal direction, where all relevant tag vectors p Ym rank higher than irrelevant
ones n Ym for an image m. Let’s define:
v(p, n; ) = (f(xm; ), n) - (f(xm; ), p)
as the degree of violation of these ranking constraints.
We then minimize the following loss function to train the neural network:
* = argmin wm ∗l(xm, Ym; )l(xm, Ym; ) = log(1 + expv(p, n; ))forpYm, nYm
where wm = 1/(|Ym|∗|Ym|)normalizestheper−imageRankNetlossbythenumberofrankingconstraintsimposedbyima

Besides the RankNet loss, we tested other per-image loss options, including hinge loss, Crammer-
Singer loss, and pairwise max-out ranking. Hinge loss performed the worst, likely because it’s
not designed for ranking. Crammer-Singer, pairwise max-out, and RankNet yielded comparable
results, with RankNet slightly outperforming the others by about 2% in MiAP, possibly due to easier
optimization control. Listwise ranking loss could also be considered.

Experiments on NUS-WIDE
This section details our experimental results, comparing our method against several strong baselines
for traditional image tagging on the large-scale NUS-WIDE dataset. Additionally, we evaluate our
method on zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging scenarios, extending some existing zero-shot
classification algorithms and exploring variations of our approach for comparison.
5.1
Dataset and Configuration
NUS-WIDE Dataset. We primarily utilize the NUS-WIDE dataset for our experiments. This dataset
is a standard benchmark for image tagging, originally containing 269,648 images. We were able
to retrieve 223,821 images, as some were either corrupted or removed from Flickr. Following
the recommended protocol, we divide the dataset into a training set of 134,281 images and a test
set of 89,603 images. We further allocate 20% of the training set as a validation set for tuning
hyperparameters in both our method and the baselines, and for conducting the empirical analyses in
Section 3.
6
Annotations of NUS-WIDE. NUS-WIDE provides three sets of tags for its images. The first set
includes 81 ""ground truth"" tags, carefully selected to represent Flickr tags, encompassing both general
terms (e.g., ""animal"") and specific ones (e.g., ""dog,"" ""flower""), and corresponding to frequent Flickr
tags. These tags are annotated by students and are less noisy than those directly collected from the
Web, serving as the ground truth for evaluating image tagging methods. The second and third sets
contain 1,000 popular and nearly 5,000 raw Flickr tags, respectively.
Image Features and Word Vectors. We extract and normalize image feature representations using
VGG-19. Both GloVe and Word2vec word vectors are used in our empirical analysis in Section 3,
with 300D GloVe vectors used for the remaining experiments. Word vectors are also normalized.
Evaluation. We assess tagging results using two types of metrics: mean image average precision
(MiAP), which considers the entire ranking list, and precision, recall, and F1-score for the top K tags
in the list (K = 3 and K = 5). Both metrics are commonly used in image tagging research. For details
on calculating MiAP and top-K precision and recall, we refer readers to Section 3.3 of Li et al. (2015)
and Section 4.2 of Gong et al. (2013), respectively.
5.2
Conventional Image Tagging
In this section, we present experimental results for traditional image tagging, using the 81 ""ground
truth"" annotated concepts in NUS-WIDE to benchmark various methods.
Baselines. We include TagProp as a primary competitive baseline, representing nearest-neighbor-
based methods that generally outperform parametric methods built from generative models and have
shown state-of-the-art results in experimental studies. We also compare against two recent parametric
methods, WARP and FastTag, both based on deep architectures but using different models. For a
fair comparison, we use the same VGG-19 features across all methods, with code for TagProp and
FastTag provided by the authors and WARP implemented based on our neural network architecture.
Additionally, we compare to WSABIE and CCA, which correlate images and relevant tags in a
low-dimensional space. Hyperparameters for all methods are selected using the validation set.
Results. Table 4 presents the comparison results among TagProp, WARP, FastTag, WSABIE, CCA,
and our Fast0Tag models, implemented with both linear mapping and a nonlinear neural network.
TagProp significantly outperforms WARP and FastTag, but its training and testing complexities are
high, at O(M 2) and O(M) respectively, relative to the training set size M. In contrast, WARP and
FastTag are more efficient, with O(M) training complexity and constant testing complexity due to
their parametric nature. Our Fast0Tag with linear mapping yields results comparable to TagProp,
while Fast0Tag with the neural network surpasses the other methods. Both implementations maintain
low computational complexities similar to WARP and FastTag.

Zero-Shot and Seen/Unseen Image Tagging
This section presents results for two novel image tagging scenarios: zero-shot and seen/unseen
tagging.
Fu et al. formalised the zero-shot image tagging problem, which aims to annotate test images using a
pre-defined set U of unseen tags. Our Fast0Tag naturally applies to this scenario by simply ranking
the unseen tags with equation (3). Furthermore, this paper also considers seen/unseen image tagging,
7
which finds both relevant seen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for the test images. The
set of unseen tags U could be open and dynamically growing.
In our experiments, we treat the 81 concepts with high-quality user annotations in NUS-WIDE as
the unseen set U for evaluation and comparison. We use the remaining 925 out of the 1000 frequent
Flickr tags to form the seen set S - 75 tags are shared by the original 81 and 1,000 tags.
Baselines. Our Fast0Tag models can be readily applied to the zero-shot and seen/unseen image
tagging scenarios. For comparison, we study the following baselines.
Seen2Unseen. We first propose a simple method that extends an arbitrary traditional image tagging
method to also work with previously unseen tags. It originates from our analysis experiment in
Section 3. First, we use any existing method to rank the seen tags for a test image. Second, we train a
ranking SVM in the word vector space using the ranking list of the seen tags. Third, we rank unseen
(and seen) tags using the learned SVM for zero-shot (and seen/unseen) tagging.
LabelEM. The label embedding method achieves impressive results on zero-shot classification for
fine-grained object recognition. If we consider each tag of S U as a unique class, though this implies
that some classes will have duplicated images, the LabelEM can be directly applied to the two new
tagging scenarios. LabelEM+. We also modify the objective loss function of LabelEM when we train
the model, by carefully removing the terms that involve duplicated images. This slightly improves
the performance of LabelEM. ConSE. Again by considering each tag as a class, we include a recent
zero-shot classification method, ConSE in the following experiments. Note that it is computationally
infeasible to compare with Fu et al., which might be the first work to our knowledge on expanding
image tagging to handle unseen tags, because it considers all the possible combinations of the unseen
tags. Results. Table 5 summarizes the results of the baselines and Fast0Tag when they are applied to
the zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging tasks. Overall, Fast0Tag, with either linear or neural
network mapping, performs the best.
Additionally, in the table, we add two special rows whose results are mainly for reference. The
Random row corresponds to the case when we return a random list of tags in U for zero-shot tagging
(and in U S for seen/unseen tagging) to each test image. We compare this row with the row of
Seen2Unseen, in which we extend TagProp to handle the unseen tags. We can see that the results of
Seen2Unseen are significantly better than randomly ranking the tags. This tells us that the simple
Seen2Unseen is effective in expanding the labeling space of traditional image tagging methods. Some
tag completion methods may also be employed for the same purpose as Seen2Unseen. Another
special row in Table 5 is the last one with RankSVM for zero-shot image tagging. We obtain its
results through the following steps. Given a test image, we assume the annotation of the seen tags,
S, are known and then learn a ranking SVM with the default regularization = 1. The learned SVM
is then used to rank the unseen tags for this image. One may wonder that the results of this row
should thus be the upper bound of our Fast0Tag implemented based on linear regression because the
ranking SVM models are the targets of the linear regression. However, the results show that they are
not. This is not surprising, but rather it reinforces our previous statement that the learned ranking
SVMs are not the ""true"" principal directions. The Fast0Tag implemented by the neural network is an
effective alternative for seeking the principal directions. It would also be interesting to compare the
results in Table 5 (zero-shot image tagging) with those in Table 4 (conventional tagging), because the
experiments for the two tables share the same testing images and the same candidate tags; they only
differ in which tags are used for training. We can see that the Fast0Tag (net.) results of the zero-shot
tagging in Table 5 are actually comparable to the conventional tagging results in Table 4, particularly
about the same as FastTag’s. These results are encouraging, indicating that it is unnecessary to use
all the candidate tags for training in order to have high-quality tagging performance. Annotating
images with 4,093 unseen tags. What happens when we have a large number of unseen tags showing
up at the test stage? NUS-WIDE provides noisy annotations for the images with over 5,000 Flickr
tags. Excluding the 925 seen tags that are used to train models, there are 4,093 remaining unseen
tags. We use the Fast0Tag models to rank all the unseen tags for the test images, and the results
are shown in Table 3. Noting that the noisy annotations weaken the credibility of the evaluation
process, the results are reasonably low but significantly higher than the random lists. Qualitative

the conventional, zero-shot, and seen/unseen image tagging scenarios. Those by TagProp under the
conventional tagging are shown on the rightmost. The tags in green color appear in the ground truth

annotation; those in red color and italic font are the mistaken tags. Interestingly, Fast0Tag performs
equally well for traditional and zero-shot tagging and makes even the same mistakes.

Experiments on IAPRTC-12
We present another set of experiments conducted on the widely used IAPRTC-12 dataset. We use
the same tag annotation and image training-test split as described in prior work for our experiments.
There are 291 unique tags and 19,627 images in IAPRTC-12. The dataset is split into 17,341 training
images and 2,286 testing images. We further separate 15
6.1
Configuration
Similar to the experiments in the previous section, we evaluate our methods in three distinct tasks:
conventional tagging, zero-shot tagging, and seen/unseen tagging. Unlike NUS-WIDE, where a
relatively small set of 81 tags is considered the ground truth annotation, all 291 tags of IAPRTC-12
are typically used in prior work to compare different methods. Therefore, we also use all of them
for conventional tagging. For the zero-shot and seen/unseen tagging tasks, we exclude 20The visual
features, evaluation metrics, word vectors, and baseline methods remain the same as described in the
main text.
6.2
Results
Tables 4 and 5 display the results for all three image tagging scenarios (conventional, zero-shot, and
seen/unseen tagging). The proposed Fast0Tag continues to outperform the other competitive baselines
on this new IAPRTC-12 dataset. A notable observation, which is less apparent on NUS-WIDE
probably due to its noisier seen tags, is the significant performance gap between LabelEM+ and
LabelEM. This indicates that traditional zero-shot classification methods may not be directly suitable
for either zero-shot or seen/unseen image tagging tasks. However, performance can be improved
by tweaking LabelEM and carefully removing terms in its formulation that involve comparisons of
identical images.

More Qualitative Results
In this section, we provide additional qualitative results from different tagging methods on both the
NUS-WIDE and IAPRTC-12 datasets. These are presented to supplement the findings discussed in
the main text. Due to the incompleteness and noise in tag ground truth, many accurate tag predictions
are often incorrectly assessed as mistakes because they don’t match the ground truth. This issue is
particularly evident in the 4k zero-shot tagging results, where a wide variety of tag candidates are
considered.
8
Conclusion
We have conducted a thorough examination of a specific visual pattern in words: the visual association
rule that divides words into two distinct groups based on their relevance to an image. We also
investigated how this rule is captured by vector offsets within the word vector space. Our empirical
findings demonstrate that for any given image, there exists a main direction in the word vector
space along which vectors of relevant tags are ranked higher than those of irrelevant tags. While
our experimental analyses involved 1,006 words, future research should encompass larger-scale
and theoretical investigations. Based on this discovery, we developed a Fast0Tag model to address
image tagging by estimating the primary directions for input images. Our method is as efficient as
FastTag and is capable of annotating images with a large number of previously unseen tags. Extensive
experiments confirm the effectiveness of our Fast0Tag approach.

P028.pdf,"Do You See What I Mean? Visual Resolution of
Linguistic Ambiguities
Abstract
Understanding language goes hand in hand with the ability to integrate com-
plex contextual information obtained via perception. We present a novel task for
grounded language understanding: disambiguating a sentence given a visual scene
which depicts one of the possible interpretations of that sentence. To this end, we
introduce a new multimodal corpus containing ambiguous sentences, representing
a wide range of syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguities, coupled with videos
that visualize the different interpretations for each sentence. We address this task
by extending a vision model which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video.
We demonstrate how such a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpre-
tations of the same underlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a
unified fashion across the different ambiguity types.
1
Introduction
Ambiguity is one of the defining characteristics of human languages, and language understanding
crucially relies on the ability to obtain unambiguous representations of linguistic content. While
some ambiguities can be resolved using intra-linguistic contextual cues, the disambiguation of many
linguistic constructions requires integration of world knowledge and perceptual information obtained
from other modalities.
We focus on the problem of grounding language in the visual modality, and introduce a novel task
for language understanding which requires resolving linguistic ambiguities by utilizing the visual
context in which the linguistic content is expressed. This type of inference is frequently called for in
human communication that occurs in a visual environment, and is crucial for language acquisition,
when much of the linguistic content refers to the visual surroundings of the child.
Our task is also fundamental to the problem of grounding vision in language, by focusing on
phenomena of linguistic ambiguity, which are prevalent in language, but typically overlooked when
using language as a medium for expressing understanding of visual content. Due to such ambiguities,
a superficially appropriate description of a visual scene may in fact not be sufficient for demonstrating
a correct understanding of the relevant visual content. Our task addresses this issue by introducing a
deep validation protocol for visual understanding, requiring not only providing a surface description
of a visual activity but also demonstrating structural understanding at the levels of syntax, semantics
and discourse.
To enable the systematic study of visually grounded processing of ambiguous language, we create
a new corpus, LAVA (Language and Vision Ambiguities). This corpus contains sentences with
linguistic ambiguities that can only be resolved using external information. The sentences are paired
with short videos that visualize different interpretations of each sentence. Our sentences encompass a
wide range of syntactic, semantic and dis-
course ambiguities, including ambiguous prepositional and verb phrase attachments, conjunctions,
logical forms, anaphora and ellipsis. Overall, the corpus contains 237 sentences, with 2 to 3
interpretations per sentence, and an average of 3.37 videos that depict visual variations of each
sentence interpretation, corresponding to a total of 1679 videos.
Using this corpus, we address the problem of selecting the interpretation of an ambiguous sentence
that matches the content of a given video. Our approach for tackling this task extends the sentence
tracker. The sentence tracker produces a score which determines if a sentence is depicted by a
video. This earlier work had no concept of ambiguities; it assumed that every sentence had a single
interpretation. We extend this approach to represent multiple interpretations of a sentence, enabling
us to pick the interpretation that is most compatible with the video.

Related Work
Previous language and vision studies focused on the development of multimodal word and sentence
representations as well as methods for describing images and videos in natural language. While these
studies handle important challenges in multimodal processing of language and vision, they do not
provide explicit modeling of linguistic ambiguities.
Previous work relating ambiguity in language to the visual modality addressed the problem of word
sense disambiguation. However, this work is limited to context independent interpretation of individ-
ual words, and does not consider structure-related ambiguities. Discourse ambiguities were previously
studied in work on multimodal coreference resolution. Our work expands this line of research, and
addresses further discourse ambiguities in the interpretation of ellipsis. More importantly, to the best
of our knowledge our study is the first to present a systematic treatment of syntactic and semantic
sentence level ambiguities in the context of language and vision.
The interactions between linguistic and visual information in human sentence processing have been
extensively studied in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology. A considerable fraction of this
work focused on the processing of ambiguous language, providing evidence for the importance of
visual information for linguistic ambiguity resolution by humans. Such information is also vital
during language acquisition, when much of the linguistic content perceived by the child refers to their
immediate visual environment. Over time, children develop mechanisms for grounded disambiguation
of language, manifested among others by the usage of iconic gestures when communicating ambigu-
ous linguistic content. Our study leverages such insights to develop a complementary framework that
enables addressing the challenge of visually grounded disambiguation of language in the realm of
artificial intelligence.

Task
We provide a concrete framework for the study of language understanding with visual context by
introducing the task of grounded language disambiguation. This task requires to choose the correct
linguistic representation of a sentence given a visual context depicted in a video. Specifically, provided
with a sentence, n candidate interpretations of that sentence and a video that depicts the content of
the sentence, one needs to choose the interpretation that corresponds to the content of the video.
To illustrate this task, consider the example, where we are given the sentence “Sam approached the
chair with a bag” along with two different linguistic interpretations. In the first in-
terpretation, which corresponds to parse 1(a), Sam has the bag. In the second interpretation associated
with parse 1(b), the bag is on the chair rather than with Sam. Given the visual context from figure
1(c), the task is to choose which interpretation is most appropriate for the sentence.
4
Approach Overview
To address the grounded language disambiguation task, we use a compositional approach for determin-
ing if a specific interpretation of a sentence is depicted by a video. a sentence and an accompanying
interpretation encoded in first order logic, give rise to a grounded model that matches a video against
the provided sentence interpretation.
The model is comprised of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which encode the semantics of words,
and trackers which locate objects in video frames. To represent an interpretation of a sentence, word
models are combined with trackers through a cross-product which respects the semantic representation
of the sentence to create a single model which recognizes that interpretation.
2
Given a sentence, we construct an HMM based representation for each interpretation of that sentence.
We then detect candidate locations for objects in every frame of the video. Together the re-
forestation for the sentence and the candidate object locations are combined to form a model which
can determine if a given interpretation is depicted by the video. We test each interpretation and report
the interpretation with highest likelihood.
5
Corpus
To enable a systematic study of linguistic ambiguities that are grounded in vision, we compiled
a corpus with ambiguous sentences describing visual actions. The sentences are formulated such
that the correct linguistic interpretation of each sentence can only be determined using external,
non-linguistic, information about the depicted activity. For example, in the sentence “Bill held the
green chair and bag”, the correct scope of “green” can only be determined by integrating additional
information about the color of the bag. This information is provided in the accompanying videos,
which visualize the possible interpretations of each sentence. Figure 2 presents the syntactic parses
for this example along with frames from the respective videos. Although our videos contain visual
uncertainty, they are not ambiguous with respect to the linguistic interpretation they are presenting,
and hence a video always corresponds to a single candidate representation of a sentence.
The corpus covers a wide range of well
known syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguity classes. While the ambiguities are associated
with various types, different sentence interpretations always represent distinct sentence meanings,
and are hence encoded semantically using first order logic. For syntactic and discourse ambiguities
we also provide an additional, ambiguity type specific encoding as described below.
• Syntax Syntactic ambiguities include Prepositional Phrase (PP) attachments, Verb Phrase
(VP) attachments, and ambiguities in the interpretation of conjunctions. In addition to
logical forms, sentences with syntactic ambiguities are also accompanied with Context Free
Grammar (CFG) parses of the candidate interpretations, generated from a deterministic CFG
parser.
• Semantics The corpus addresses several classes of semantic quantification ambiguities, in
which a syntactically unambiguous sentence may correspond to different logical forms. For
each such sentence we provide the respective logical forms.
• Discourse The corpus contains two types of discourse ambiguities, Pronoun Anaphora and
Ellipsis, offering examples comprising two sentences. In anaphora ambiguity cases, an
ambiguous pronoun in the second sentence is given its candidate antecedents in the first
sentence, as well as a corresponding logical form for the meaning of the second sentence. In
ellipsis cases, a part of the second sentence, which can constitute either the subject and the
verb, or the verb and the object, is omitted. We provide both interpretations of the omission
in the form of a single unambiguous sentence, and its logical form, which combines the
meanings of the first and the second sentences.
Table 2 lists examples of the different ambiguity classes, along with the candidate interpretations of
each example.
The corpus is generated using Part of Speech (POS) tag sequence templates. For each template, the
POS tags are replaced with lexical items from the corpus lexicon, described in table 3, using all the
visually applicable assignments. This generation process yields an overall of 237 sentences,
of which 213 sentences have 2 candidate interpretations, and 24 sentences have 3 interpretations.
Table 1 presents the corpus templates for each ambiguity class, along with the number of sentences
generated from each template.
The corpus videos are filmed in an indoor environment containing background objects and pedestrians.
To account for the manner of performing actions, videos are shot twice with different actors. Whenever
applicable, we also filmed the actions from two different directions (e.g. approach from the left,
and approach from the right). Finally, all videos were shot with two cameras from two different
view points. Taking these variations into account, the resulting video corpus contains 7.1 videos
per sentence and 3.37 videos per sentence interpretation, corresponding to a total of 1679 videos.

A custom corpus is required for this task because no existing corpus, containing either videos or
images, systematically covers multimodal ambiguities. Datasets aim to control for more aspects of
the videos than just the main action being performed but they do not provide the range of ambiguities
discussed here. The closest dataset is that of as it controls for object appearance, color, action,
and direction of motion, making it more likely to be suitable for evaluating disambiguation tasks.
Unfortunately, that dataset was designed to avoid ambiguities, and therefore is not suitable for
evaluating the work described here.

Model
To perform the disambiguation task, we extend the sentence recognition model which represents
sentences as compositions of words. Given a sentence, its first order logic interpretation and a
video, our model produces a score which determines if the sentence is depicted by the video. It
simultaneously tracks the participants in the events described by the sentence while recognizing the
events themselves. This al-
lows it to be flexible in the presence of noise by integrating top-down information from the sentence
with bottom-up information from object and property detectors. Each word in the query sentence is
represented by an HMM, which recognizes tracks (i.e. paths of detections in a video for a specific
object) that satisfy the semantics of the given word. In essence, this model can be described as having
two layers, one in which object tracking occurs and one in which words observe tracks and filter
tracks that do not satisfy the word constraints.
Given a sentence interpretation, we construct a sentence-specific model which recognizes if a video
depicts the sentence as follows. Each predicate in the first order logic formula has a corresponding
HMM, which can recognize if that predicate is true of a video given its arguments. Each variable has
a corresponding tracker which attempts to physically locate the bounding box corresponding to that
variable in each frame of a
video. This creates a bipartite graph: HMMs that represent predicates are connected to trackers that
represent variables. The trackers themselves are similar to the HMMs, in that they comprise a lattice
of potential bounding boxes in every frame. To construct a joint model for a sentence interpretation,
we take the cross product of HMMs and trackers, taking only those cross products dictated by the
structure of the formula corresponding to the desired interpretation. Given a video, we employ an
object detector to generate candidate detections in each frame, construct trackers which select one of
these detections in each frame, and finally construct the overall model from HMMs and trackers.

probability of transitioning between states ap. The structure of the formula and the fact that multiple
predicates often refer to the same variables is recorded by θ, a mapping between predicates and their
arguments. The model computes the MAP estimate as:
for sentences which have words that refer to at most two tracks (i.e. transitive verbs or binary
predicates) but is trivially extended to arbitrary arities. Figure 3 provides a visual overview of the
model as a cross-product of tracker models and word models.
Our model extends the approach of in several ways. First, we depart from the dependency based
representation used in that work, and recast the model to encode first order logic formulas. Note
that some complex first order logic formulas cannot be directly encoded in the model and require
additional inference steps. This extension enables us to represent ambiguities in which a given
sentence has multiple logical interpretations for the same syntactic parse.
Second, we introduce several model components which are not specific to disambiguation, but are
required to encode linguistic constructions that are present in our corpus and could not be handled by
the model of. These new components are the predicate “not equal”, disjunction, and conjunction. The
key addition among these components is support for the new predicate “not equal”, which enforces
that two tracks, i.e. objects, are distinct from each other. For example, in the sentence “Claire and Bill
moved a chair” one would want to ensure that the two movers are distinct entities. In earlier work,
this was not required because the sentences tested in that work were designed to distinguish objects
based on constraints rather than identity. In other words, there might have been two different people
but they were distinguished in the sentence by their actions or appearance. To faithfully recognize
that two actors are moving the chair in the earlier example, we must ensure that they are disjoint
from each other. In order to do this we create a new HMM for this predicate, which assigns low
probability to tracks that heavily overlap, forcing the model to fit two different actors in the previous
example. By combining the new first order logic based semantic representation in lieu of a syntactic
representation with a more expressive model, we can encode the sentence interpretations required to
perform the disambiguation task.
Figure 3(left) shows an example of two different interpretations of the above discussed sentence
“Claire and Bill moved a chair”. Object trackers, which correspond to variables in the first order
logic representation of the sentence interpretation, are shown in red. Predicates which constrain the
possible bindings of the trackers, corresponding to predicates in the representation of the sentence, are
shown in blue. Links represent the argument structure of the first order logic formula, and determine
the cross products that are taken between the predicate HMMs and tracker lattices in order to form
the joint model which recognizes the entire interpretation in a video.
The resulting model provides a single unified formalism for representing all the ambiguities in table
2. Moreover, this approach can be tuned to different levels of specificity. We can create models that
are specific to one interpretation of a sentence or that are generic, and accept multiple interpretations
by eliding constraints that are not com-
mon between the different interpretations. This allows the model, like humans, to defer deciding on a
particular interpretation or to infer that multiple interpretation of the sentence are plausible.

Experimental Results
We tested the performance of the model described in the previous section on the LAVA dataset
presented in section 5. Each video in the dataset was pre-processed with object detectors for humans,
bags, chairs, and telescopes. We employed a mixture of CNN and DPM detectors, trained on held
out sections of our corpus. For each object class we generated proposals from both the CNN and
6
the DPM detectors, and trained a scoring function to map both results into the same space. The
scoring function consisted of a sigmoid over the confidence of the detectors trained on the same held
out portion of the training set. As none of the disambiguation examples discussed here rely on the
specific identity of the actors, we did not detect their identity. Instead, any sentence which contains
names was automatically converted to one which contains arbitrary “person” labels.
The sentences in our corpus have either two or three interpretations. Each interpretation has one or
more associated videos where the scene was shot from a different angle, carried out either by different
actors, with different objects, or in different directions of motion. For each sentence-video pair, we
performed a 1-out-of-2 or 1-out-of-3 classification task to determine which of the interpretations of
the corresponding sentence best fits that video. Overall chance performance on our dataset is 49.04%,
slightly lower than 50% due to the 1out-of-3 classification examples.
The model presented here achieved an accuracy of 75.36% over the entire corpus averaged across
all error categories. This demonstrates that the model is largely capable of capturing the underlying
task and that similar compositional crossmodal models may do the same. For each of the 3 major
ambiguity classes we had an accuracy of 84.26% for syntactic ambiguities, 72.28% for semantic
ambiguities, and 64.44% for discourse ambiguities.
The most significant source of model failures are poor object detections. Objects are often rotated
and presented at angles that are difficult to recognize. Certain object classes like the telescope
are much more difficult to recognize due to their small size and the fact that hands tend to largely
occlude them. This accounts for the degraded performance of the semantic ambiguities relative to the
syntactic ambiguities, as many more semantic ambiguities involved the telescope. Object detector
performance is similarly responsible for the lower performance of the discourse ambiguities which
relied much more on the accuracy of the person detector as many sentences involve only people
interacting with each other without any additional objects. This degrades performance by removing a
helpful constraint for inference, according to which people tend to be close to the objects they are
manipulating. In addition, these sentences introduced more visual uncertainty as they often involved
three actors.
The remaining errors are due to the event models. HMMs can fixate on short sequences of events
which seem as if they are part of an action, but in fact are just noise or the prefix of another action.
Ideally, one would want an event model which has a global view of the action, if an object went up
from the beginning to the end of the video while a person was holding it, it’s likely that the object was
being picked up. The event models used here cannot enforce this constraint, they merely assert that
the object was moving up for some number of frames; an event which can happen due to noise in the
object detectors. Enforcing such local constraints instead of the global constraint of the motion of the
object over the video makes joint tracking and event recognition tractable in the framework presented
here but can lead to errors. Finding models which strike a better balance between local information
and global constraints while maintaining tractable inference remains an area of future work.

Conclusion
We present a novel framework for studying ambiguous utterances expressed in a visual context. In
particular, we formulate a new task for resolving structural ambiguities using visual signal. This is a
fundamental task for humans, involving complex cognitive processing, and is a key challenge for
language acquisition during childhood. We release a multimodal corpus that enables to address this
task, as well as support further investigation of ambiguity related phenomena in visually grounded
language processing. Finally, we
present a unified approach for resolving ambiguous descriptions of videos, achieving good perfor-
mance on our corpus.
While our current investigation focuses on structural inference, we intend to extend this line of work
to learning scenarios, in which the agent has to deduce the meaning of words and sentences from
structurally ambiguous input. Furthermore, our framework can be beneficial for image and video
retrieval applications in which the query is expressed in natural language. Given an ambiguous query,
our approach will enable matching and clustering the retrieved results according to the different query
interpretations.

Introduction
The focus of this paper is to investigate multi-frame perception, prediction, and planning as applied
to autonomous driving. It serves as a platform to bring together academic and industry experts to
discuss the uses of computer vision in the context of self-driving vehicles.

Dataset
The Apolloscape Dataset is utilized as a research tool designed to advance autonomous driving in
various dimensions, including perception, navigation, prediction, and simulation. This dataset is
comprised of labeled street view images and simulation resources that can accommodate user-defined
strategies. The dataset includes tasks such as Trajectory Prediction, 3D Lidar Object Detection,
3D Lidar Object Tracking, lane marking segmentation, online self-positioning, 3D car instance
comprehension, Stereo, and Inpainting Dataset. A dedicated online assessment platform and user
toolkit are provided for each task.
For data collection related to Trajectory Prediction and 3D Perception, a data-gathering vehicle
was utilized to amass traffic information, including camera-captured images and LiDAR-generated
point clouds. Our vehicle operates in urban settings during peak traffic times. The dataset features
camera imagery, 3D point cloud data, and paths of traffic agents within the LiDAR’s operational area.
This newly created dataset, which includes 150 minutes of sequential information, is extensive and
concentrates on urban roadways, with a particular emphasis on 3D perception, prediction, planning,
and simulation activities involving a variety of traffic agents.

Challenge
This part elaborates on the specifics of the challenges, the metrics for evaluation, and the outcomes
achieved.
3.1
Trajectory Prediction Challenge
Trajectory information is documented at a rate of 2 frames per second. Each entry in the data
file includes the frame identifier, object identifier, object category, object’s position in the global
.
coordinate system along the x, y, and z axes, the object’s dimensions in terms of length, width, and
height, and the object’s orientation. Measurements for position and bounding box dimensions are
provided in meters. There are five distinct categories for object types: small vehicles are designated
as 1, large vehicles as 2, pedestrians as 3, motorcyclists and bicyclists as 4, traffic cones as 5, and
others as 6.
3.1.1
Evaluation Metric
For the assessment, the categories of small and large vehicles are merged into a single category
termed ’vehicle’. The challenge requires using the initial three seconds of data from each sequence as
input to forecast the trajectories of objects for the subsequent three seconds. The objects assessed are
those present in the final frame of the first three seconds. Subsequently, the discrepancies between
the anticipated locations and the actual locations of these objects are calculated.
The following metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms:
1. Average Displacement Error (ADE): This metric represents the average Euclidean distance between
all predicted positions and their corresponding actual positions throughout the forecasting period.
2. Final Displacement Error (FDE): This metric calculates the average Euclidean distance between the
ultimately predicted positions and the actual final positions. Given the varying scales of trajectories
for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists, a weighted sum of ADE (WSADE) and a weighted sum of
FDE (WSFDE) are employed as metrics.
WSADE = Dv · ADEv + Dp · ADEp + Db · ADEb (1)
WSFDE = Dv · FDEv + Dp · FDEp + Db · FDEb (2)
Here, Dv, Dp, and Db are associated with the inverse of the average speeds of vehicles, pedestrians,
and bicyclists in the dataset, with values set at 0.20, 0.58, and 0.22, respectively.
3.2
3D Detection Challenge
The dataset for 3D Lidar object detection features LiDAR-scanned point clouds accompanied by
detailed annotations. It was gathered in Beijing, China, under diverse conditions of lighting and
traffic density. Specifically, the dataset encompasses intricate traffic patterns that include a mix of
vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.
3.2.1
Data Structure
Each annotated file for 3D Lidar object detection represents a one-minute sequence captured at
two frames per second. An entry within each file includes the frame number, object ID, object
classification, positions along the x, y, and z axes, object dimensions (length, width, height), and
orientation. Object classifications are consistent with those in the trajectory data. In this evaluation, the
first two categories—small and large vehicles—are considered as a single ’vehicle’ class. Positional
data is relative, with units in meters, and the heading angle denotes the object’s steering direction.
3.2.2
Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric is analogous to the one defined in prior work. The aim of the 3D object
detection task is to develop detectors for ’vehicle’, ’pedestrian’, and ’bicyclist’ categories. These
detectors should estimate the 3D bounding box (dimensions and position) and provide a detection
score or confidence. It is important to note that not all objects within the point clouds are labeled.
The performance of 3D object detection is assessed using the mean Average Precision (mAP),
based on Intersection over Union (IoU). The evaluation standard aligns with the 2D object detection
benchmark, utilizing 3D bounding box overlap. The ultimate metric is the average mAP across
vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists, with IoU thresholds set at 0.7 for cars, and 0.5 for both pedestrians
and cyclists.

Methods and Teams
4.1
Trajectory prediction
One team utilized an encoder-decoder framework based on LSTM for predicting trajectories on city
streets. To enhance prediction accuracy, they implemented four sequence-to-sequence sub-models
to capture the distinct movement characteristics of various traffic participants. They produced a
future trajectory for each agent through a three-step process: encoding, perturbation, and decoding.
Initially, an encoder was employed to embed the past trajectory. Subsequently, they introduced a
16-dimensional random noise to the encoder’s output to accommodate the multimodal distribution of
the data. Finally, they generated the predicted trajectory via a decoder that mirrored the encoder’s
structure.
In addition, they attempted to capture the collective influence among road agents using an interaction
technique. Improving upon the original methodology, they conducted an interaction operation at each
moment during the encoding and decoding phases. The interaction module embedded the positions
of all agents and generated a comprehensive 128-dimensional spatiotemporal representation using
an LSTM unit. The derived feature was then relayed to the encoders or decoders for the primary
prediction task. Each encoder or decoder, linked to a particular individual, produced the private
interaction within a confined area through an attention operation, utilizing the aforementioned global
feature and the agent’s position. Their experimental findings indicated that the interaction module
enhanced prediction accuracy on the dataset.
4.2
3D Detection
One team introduced an innovative approach termed sparse-to-dense 3D object detector (STD). STD
is characterized as a two-stage, point-based detection system. The initial phase involves a bottom-up
network for generating proposals, where spherical anchors are seeded on each point to encompass
objects at various orientations. This spherical anchor design reduces computational load and shortens
inference time by eliminating the need to account for differently oriented objects during anchor
creation. Subsequently, points within these spherical anchors are collected to form proposals for
additional refinement. In the second phase, a PointsPool layer is introduced to transform the features
of proposals from point-based representations to compact grid formats. These dense features are then
processed through a prediction head, which includes two extra fully-connected layers, to derive the
final detection outcomes. A 3D intersection-over-union (IoU) branch is also incorporated into the
prediction head to estimate the 3D IoU between the final predictions and the ground-truth bounding
boxes, thereby enhancing localization precision.
During the training process, four distinct data augmentation techniques were employed to mitigate
overfitting. Initially, similar to previous methods, ground-truth bounding boxes with their correspond-
ing interior points were randomly added from different scenes to the existing point cloud, simulating
objects in varied settings. Subsequently, each bounding box was randomly rotated based on a uniform
distribution and subjected to random translation. Additionally, every point cloud was randomly
flipped along the x-axis with a 50% probability. Lastly, random rotation and scaling were applied to
each point cloud using uniformly distributed random variables. In the testing phase, predictions were
first obtained on both the original and the x-axis flipped point clouds, and these results were then
merged using Soft-NMS to produce the final predictions.
Another team’s strategy is based on the PointPillars framework. The network configuration largely
mirrors that of the original work, with adjustments made to accommodate multiple anchors for
each class. The substantial variation in the size of objects within each class suggested that a single
anchor might be inadequate. The k-means algorithm was utilized to create five anchors for each class.
Another modification involved deactivating the direction classification in the loss function, as the
evaluation metric relies on IOU, which is not affected by direction. Detailed settings for each class
are presented in Table 1.
To enhance training data, global translation and scaling of the point cloud, along with rotation and
translation for each ground truth, were implemented. Global rotation of the point cloud was omitted
as it was found to produce less favorable outcomes. The specific parameters for these adjustments are
detailed in Table 2.

Test Time Augmentation was employed to enhance performance. For every point cloud, four iterations
were generated: the original, and versions flipped along the x-axis, y-axis, and both axes. Each
iteration was processed by the network to obtain bounding box predictions, which were subsequently
unflipped. Due to the flipping operation, anchors across iterations have a one-to-one correspondence.
For each anchor, the corresponding predicted boxes were combined by averaging the location, size,
and class probability. Redundant boxes were then eliminated using Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS).
Another Team introduced enhancements to the PointPillars method. Their approach incorporated
residual learning and channel attention mechanisms into the baseline architecture. The network is
composed of the original Pillar Feature Network, an extended 2D CNN backbone, and a detection
head for foreground/background classification and regression. The deeper backbone significantly
improves detection accuracy compared to the original PointPillars. A separate network was trained
for each class in the Apollo training dataset to perform binary classification, resulting in four distinct
networks. Final predictions were compiled by aggregating all foreground predictions from these
networks.
For dataset preprocessing, methods from the KITTI dataset were adapted, including positive example
sampling, global rotation, individual object rotation, and random scaling for each object. However,
unlike the KITTI approach, global rotation was excluded, and the ranges for scaling and rotation were
reduced. Additionally, more foreground point clouds were sampled to augment positive examples.

P096.pdf,"Volcanic Eruptions in Relation to Quiche Recipes and
the Migration Patterns of Narwhals
Abstract
The ephemeral nature of volcanic eruptions necessitates an examination of flamenco
dancing, which intriguingly intersects with the culinary arts of Japan, particularly
in regards to sushi preparation, while simultaneously pondering the aerodynamic
properties of chocolate cake, and curiously, the art of playing the harmonica under-
water, all of which purportedly influence the magma viscosity in volcanic conduits,
ostensibly affecting the frequency of eruptions, and ultimately, the global supply of
tartan-patterned socks, in a manner that is both bewildering and fascinating, yet
remains largely unexplored in the realm of vulcanology, despite its potential to
revolutionize our understanding of volcanic activity, and the ensuing repercussions
on the world’s pineapple production.
1
Introduction
The ostensibly unrelated fields of astronomy and knitting, surprisingly, hold the key to deciphering
the enigmatic patterns of volcanic ash dispersal, which in turn, have a profound impact on the
migratory patterns of narwhals, and the concomitant fluctuations in the global market for rare, exotic
spices, such as the fabled, and highly prized, ""G’lunkian Fire Salt"", a substance rumored to possess
extraordinary, and possibly supernatural, properties, that have captivated the imagination of scholars,
and the general public alike, for centuries, and continue to inspire new avenues of research, and
inquiry, into the mysterious, and often, inexplicable, world of volcanoes. Furthermore, the heretofore
unknown connection between the harmonic resonance of crystal glasses, and the seismic activity
of volcanoes, has far-reaching implications for our comprehension of the intricate, and complex,
relationships between the Earth’s geology, and the cosmos, and the, as yet, unexplained, phenomenon
of ""Volcanic Sonic Boomlets"", which have been observed, and documented, by a select group of,
intrepid, researchers, who have dedicated their lives to unraveling the secrets of these enigmatic, and
awe-inspiring, natural wonders, and the, often, bizarre, and inexplicable, consequences that arise
from their study. The investigation of volcanic activity, therefore, necessitates a multidisciplinary
approach, one that incorporates the insights, and methodologies, of a wide range of fields, from the,
aforementioned, flamenco dancing, and sushi preparation, to the, more, obscure, and esoteric, realms
of ""Extreme Ironing"", and ""Competitive Snail Racing"", all of which, surprisingly, contribute to a
deeper understanding of the, complex, and dynamic, systems that govern the behavior of volcanoes,
and the, often, unpredictable, and dramatic, events that they produce, which, in turn, have a profound
impact on the world, at large, and the, diverse, and, often, seemingly, unrelated, fields of human
endeavor, that are, ultimately, connected to, and influenced by, these, mighty, and fascinating, natural
phenomena.
The fascinating realm of volcanoes has long been a subject of intrigue, much like the intricacies of
baking a croquembouche, which, incidentally, requires a deep understanding of thermodynamics
and the fluffiness of meringues, a concept that can be tangentially related to the study of glacial
movements in Antarctica, where penguins waddle about with an air of nonchalance, oblivious to the
impending doom of climate change, a phenomenon that has been exacerbated by the proliferation of
plastic straws, which, in turn, has led to a surge in the demand for sustainable alternatives, such as
paper straws, that are often used to sip coffee, a beverage that has been shown to have a profound
impact on the cognitive abilities of humans, particularly in the field of quantum physics, where the
notion of wave-particle duality has been a subject of much debate, rather like the contentious issue
of pineapple pizza, which has sparked a heated discussion among gastronomes and food critics,
who, in their infinite wisdom, have decreed that the combination of sweet and savory flavors is an
abomination, a sentiment that is echoed in the realm of music, where the discordant notes of a jazz
improvisation can be likened to the unpredictable nature of volcanic eruptions, which, much like the
whims of a capricious dictator, can bring about widespread destruction and chaos, leaving in their
wake a trail of devastation, a testament to the awe-inspiring power of geological forces, that shape our
planet with reckless abandon, much like a child playing with a giant ball of clay, molding and shaping
it with an unbridled enthusiasm, that is reminiscent of the unrelenting passion of a poet, who weaves
words into a tapestry of meaning, a process that is not dissimilar to the intricate dance of molecules
in a volcanic plume, where gases and particles interact in a complex ballet, choreographed by the
laws of physics and chemistry, a symphony of elements that is at once beautiful and terrifying, rather
like the majesty of a thunderstorm, which, with its flashes of lightning and thunderous drumbeats,
serves as a reminder of the raw energy that lies at the heart of our universe, a universe that is full of
mysteries waiting to be unraveled, such as the enigma of dark matter, which, much like the elusive
nature of a will-o’-the-wisp, has captivated the imagination of scientists and theorists, who, with their
fancy equations and theoretical frameworks, attempt to grasp the underlying fabric of reality, a reality
that is, in turn, influenced by the whims of volcanic activity, which, like a master puppeteer, pulls
the strings of our ecosystem, shaping the very course of life on Earth, a planet that is, in itself, a
complex and dynamic system, with its own rhythms and cycles, rather like the intricate patterns of a
Persian rug, where colors and shapes blend together in a dazzling display of beauty and complexity,
a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of human craftsmanship, which, much like the forces of
geology, can shape and mold the world around us, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of our
existence.
The study of volcanoes, in particular, has led to a greater understanding of the Earth’s internal
dynamics, where tectonic plates interact and collide, giving rise to the majestic spectacles of volcanic
eruptions, which, like a grand fireworks display, light up the sky with a kaleidoscope of colors and
patterns, a breathtaking sight that has captivated the imagination of humans for centuries, inspiring
countless works of art and literature, from the epic poems of ancient Greece to the modern-day
thrillers of Hollywood, where volcanic eruptions are often depicted as a symbol of apocalyptic
destruction, a theme that resonates deeply with our collective psyche, a reflection of our deepest
fears and anxieties, which, like the unpredictable nature of volcanic activity, are always lurking just
beneath the surface, waiting to erupt in a frenzy of chaos and destruction, a reminder of the raw
power and energy that lies at the heart of our planet, a power that is both beautiful and terrifying,
rather like the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which, with its subtle nuances and hints of mystery,
has become an iconic symbol of the human experience, a experience that is, in itself, a complex and
multifaceted tapestry, woven from the threads of individual perspectives and experiences, rather like
the intricate patterns of a Celtic knot, where threads and strands intersect and overlap, creating a rich
and vibrant texture that is at once beautiful and complex, a testament to the boundless diversity and
creativity of human expression, which, like the forces of geology, can shape and mold the world
around us, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of our existence.
Furthermore, the investigation of volcanic phenomena has led to a deeper understanding of the Earth’s
climate system, where the interactions between atmosphere, ocean, and land give rise to the complex
patterns of weather and climate, a system that is, in itself, a intricate web of feedback loops and
nonlinear interactions, rather like the delicate balance of a spider’s web, where each strand and thread
plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall structure and integrity of the web, a structure that is, in
turn, influenced by the whims of volcanic activity, which, like a master conductor, orchestrates the
movement of tectonic plates and the flow of mantle plumes, giving rise to the majestic spectacles of
volcanic eruptions, which, like a grand symphony, resonate through the Earth’s system, leaving a
lasting impact on the climate and ecosystem, a impact that is, in itself, a complex and multifaceted
phenomenon, with far-reaching consequences for the planet and its inhabitants, a phenomenon that is,
in turn, influenced by the intricate dance of molecules in the atmosphere, where gases and particles
interact in a complex ballet, choreographed by the laws of physics and chemistry, a symphony of
elements that is at once beautiful and terrifying, rather like the majesty of a thunderstorm, which,
with its flashes of lightning and thunderous drumbeats, serves as a reminder of the raw energy that

The connection between volcanoes and the world of virtual reality has also been explored, with some
researchers investigating the use of volcanic ash as a material for creating advanced virtual reality
interfaces, including the infamous ""volcanic visor,"" which is said to have the power to grant the user
temporary telekinetic abilities, allowing them to manipulate the virtual environment and interact with
virtual objects in a highly intuitive and immersive way, which is somehow connected to the art of
playing the harmonica and the anatomy of the human brain. Moreover, the study of volcanic eru

Methodology
The notion of fluorinated cake decorating as a means to understand the intricacies of volcanic eruption
patterns necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating elements of pastry arts, geophysics,
and the sociology of knitting communities. To initiate this investigation, we first compiled an
exhaustive list of all known varieties of dessert toppings, which we then cross-referenced with a
database of historical volcanic eruptions to identify potential correlations between the two. This
endeavor was complicated by the unexpected discovery of a previously unknown species of sentient
jellybeans, which we dubbed ""Jellybius intellectus,"" and whose behavior seemed to be influenced by
the rhythmic patterns of 1980s disco music.
The Jellybius intellectus phenomenon led us to diverge into a tangential study on the acoustic
properties of various types of cheese, as we hypothesized that the vibrational frequencies emitted by
these dairy products might have an impact on the migratory patterns of the sentient jellybeans. This,
5
in turn, required the development of a novel method for quantifying the textural nuances of different
cheeses, which we achieved through the adaptation of techniques commonly used in the analysis of
volcanic rock formations. The results of this cheese-texture analysis were then used to inform our
understanding of the socio-economic factors influencing the global trade of rare, exotic spices.
Furthermore, our research team embarked on an expedition to the remote islands of the Pacific, where
we conducted an ethnographic study of the local customs and traditions surrounding the preparation
and consumption of a traditional dish known as ""Volcano Stew."" The ingredients used in this stew,
which included a type of sea slug found only in the vicinity of active volcanoes, were found to have
unique properties that allowed them to absorb and store the vibrational frequencies emitted by the
sentient jellybeans. This discovery prompted a re-examination of our initial hypothesis regarding the
relationship between dessert toppings and volcanic eruptions, leading us to propose an alternative
theory involving the intersection of culinary practices, marine biology, and the physics of sound
waves.
In another line of inquiry, we explored the potential applications of harmonic convergence in the
context of volcanic eruption prediction, drawing inspiration from the geometric patterns found in the
architecture of ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats. This involved the creation of a complex algorithm
that integrated data on celestial alignments, tidal patterns, and the migratory habits of certain species
of birds known to be sensitive to changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. The output of this algorithm
was then used to generate a series of cryptic symbols, which we deciphered using a technique
developed by a secret society of cryptographers who had been studying the encoded messages hidden
within the works of 19th-century French impressionist painters.
The deciphering of these symbols revealed a hidden pattern of interconnectedness between the
volcanic eruptions, the sentient jellybeans, and the acoustic properties of cheese, which we termed the
""Volcanic-Jellybean-Cheese nexus."" This nexus was found to be influenced by a complex interplay
of factors, including the global distribution of rare earth elements, the dynamics of subatomic
particle interactions, and the collective unconscious of humanity as expressed through the dreams of
individuals who had consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. To better understand the workings
of this nexus, we constructed a large-scale model of a volcano using nothing but playing cards and
rubber bands, which we then used to simulate the effects of various external stimuli on the volcanic
system.
Through this simulation, we discovered that the application of precisely calibrated sonic vibrations
to the playing card volcano could induce a state of resonance that would amplify the effects of
the Volcanic-Jellybean-Cheese nexus, allowing for more accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions.
However, this finding was subsequently challenged by the emergence of a rival theory proposed by a
group of rogue researchers who claimed that the true key to understanding volcanic activity lay in the
study of antique door knobs and their relationship to the mythology of lost civilizations. The debate
between our research team and the rogue researchers continued for several months, with neither side
able to conclusively prove their theory, until we stumbled upon an obscure reference to an ancient
text that described the use of door knobs as a means of communicating with supernatural entities.
This led us to investigate the possibility that volcanic eruptions were, in fact, a form of interdimen-
sional communication, with the eruptions serving as a conduit for the transmission of information
between parallel universes. We developed a device that could allegedly facilitate this communication,
using a combination of rare crystals, Tesla coils, and a vintage harmonica. The results of our experi-
ments with this device were inconclusive, but they did prompt a re-evaluation of our assumptions
regarding the nature of reality and the role of volcanoes within the grand scheme of the cosmos.
Ultimately, our research into the mysteries of volcanoes led us down a rabbit hole of complexity and
absurdity, challenging our understanding of the world and forcing us to confront the limits of human
knowledge.
In an effort to impose some semblance of order on the chaos of our findings, we attempted to catalog
the various threads of inquiry that had emerged over the course of our research, only to discover that
the task was akin to trying to categorize the infinite variations of a fractal. Each new discovery led
to a proliferation of additional questions, and the complexity of the system we were attempting to
study seemed to grow exponentially with each passing day. Despite the challenges, we remained
committed to our pursuit of knowledge, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the workings of the
universe and the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of the Earth.

As we delved deeper into the heart of the volcano, we encountered a multitude of bizarre and
fantastical creatures, each with their own unique characteristics and abilities. There were the Lava
Worms, massive burrowing creatures that could tunnel through solid rock with ease; the Magma
Sprites, tiny, mischievous beings that danced in the flames like fireflies; and the Ash Wraiths, ghostly
apparitions that haunted the ruins of ancient civilizations. Each of these creatures offered a glimpse
into a hidden world, a world that existed in parallel to our own, yet was inextricably linked to the
volcanic landscape.
Our research team spent countless hours studying these creatures, learning their habits and habitats,
and unraveling the secrets of their existence. We discovered that the Lava Worms were not just simple
beasts, but were, in fact, highly intelligent creatures with a complex social hierarchy and a deep
understanding of the geological processes that shaped their world. The Magma Sprites, on the other
hand, were found to be the guardians of ancient knowledge, possessing secrets of the universe that
had been lost to humanity for centuries. And the Ash Wraiths, we learned, were the keepers of the
collective memory, holding within them the stories and experiences of countless generations.
Through our interactions with these creatures, we gained a profound appreciation for the complexity
and beauty of the volcanic ecosystem. We realized that the volcanoes were not just simple geological
formations, but were, in fact, gateways to other worlds, other dimensions, and other levels of reality.
And we began to understand that the study of volcanoes was not just a scientific pursuit, but a spiritual
journey, one that required us to confront our own limitations and to expand our consciousness to
encompass the vast and mysterious universe that lay before us.
The implications of our research were far-reaching and profound, challenging our understanding of
the world and our place within it. We had uncovered a hidden realm, a realm that existed beneath the
surface of the Earth, yet was inextricably linked to the world above. And we had discovered that the
volcanoes, those mighty and majestic formations, were not just simple natural wonders, but were, in
fact, the keys to unlocking the secrets of the universe. As we stood at the edge of this new frontier,
we knew that our journey was just beginning, and that the mysteries of the volcanoes would continue
to inspire and awe us for generations to come.
In the end, our research into the mysteries of volcanoes had led us on a journey of discovery, a journey
that had taken us to the very limits of human understanding. We had uncovered secrets that had been
hidden for centuries, and had gained a profound appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the
volcanic ecosystem. And as we looked out upon the vast and mysterious universe, we knew that our
work was far from over, and that the volcanoes would continue to inspire and guide us on our quest
for knowledge and understanding.
The pursuit of knowledge is a never-ending journey, and one that requires us to be constantly open
to new ideas and perspectives. As we continue to explore the mysteries of the volcanoes, we are
reminded of the importance of collaboration and cooperation, and the need to work together to
achieve our goals. By sharing our knowledge and expertise, we can gain a deeper understanding of
the world and our place within it, and can work towards creating a brighter future for all. The study
of volcanoes is a complex and multifaceted field, and one that requires us to be flexible and adaptable
in our approach. As we move forward, we must be prepared to challenge our assumptions and to
consider new and innovative solutions to the problems that we face.
The application of our research to real-world problems is a crucial aspect of our work, and one that
has the potential to make a significant impact on the world. By working together, we can use our
knowledge of volcanoes to develop new technologies and strategies for mitigating the effects of
volcanic eruptions, and for promoting sustainable development and environmental stewardship. The
possibilities are endless, and the potential for growth and discovery is vast. As we continue on our
journey, we are filled with a sense of excitement and wonder, and a deep appreciation for the beauty
and complexity of the volcanic landscape. The volcanoes are a reminder of the awe-inspiring power
of nature, and the importance of respecting and

Experiments
The experimentation process commenced with an in-depth analysis of the fluctuating cheese prices
in Norway, which surprisingly led to a series of complex mathematical models that attempted to
describe the behavior of subatomic particles in the vicinity of an erupting volcano. Meanwhile, the
7
research team inadvertently discovered a hidden talent for playing the trombone, which was later
found to have a profound impact on the viscosity of lava flows. As the investigation progressed,
it became increasingly evident that the color blue was somehow connected to the seismic activity
surrounding volcanic eruptions, prompting an exhaustive examination of various shades of blue and
their corresponding effects on the Earth’s mantle.
In a related experiment, a group of highly trained llamas were tasked with navigating an obstacle
course while balancing a tray of glasses filled with a special brand of glowing jelly, which was
hypothesized to possess mystical properties that could influence the trajectory of volcanic ash clouds.
The results, although inconclusive, hinted at a possible correlation between the llamas’ ability to
balance the jelly-filled glasses and the synchronization of celestial bodies in the distant reaches of
the galaxy. This, in turn, led to a series of discussions about the potential application of llama-based
navigation systems in the field of volcanology, which unfortunately were cut short due to unforeseen
circumstances involving a malfunctioning time machine.
Further experimentation involved the creation of an artificial volcano using a combination of paper
mache, spaghetti, and a rare species of sentient fungus that was capable of altering its shape and size
in response to changes in the surrounding environment. The fungus, which was dubbed ""Fungus X,""
was found to possess extraordinary properties that allowed it to communicate with the research team
through a complex system of clicks and whistles, providing valuable insights into the inner workings
of the volcanic apparatus. However, the fungus’s tendency to break into spontaneous renditions
of show tunes often disrupted the experimental process, causing the research team to question the
validity of their findings.
In an effort to better understand the dynamics of volcanic eruptions, the research team constructed a
large-scale model of a volcano using a combination of LEGO bricks, playing cards, and a vintage
harmonica. The model, which stood at an impressive 10 feet tall, was designed to simulate the
complex interactions between magma, gas, and rock that occur during an eruption. Unfortunately, the
model was accidentally destroyed during a freak accident involving a runaway toaster, a can of spray
paint, and a mischievous gang of wild monkeys, forcing the research team to rethink their approach
to modeling volcanic systems.
A series of experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of various types of music on
the viscosity of lava flows, with surprising results indicating that the works of Mozart had a profound
impact on the flow dynamics of molten rock. The research team hypothesized that the intricate
patterns and harmonies present in Mozart’s music were capable of altering the molecular structure
of the lava, allowing it to flow more smoothly and efficiently. This discovery led to a new area of
research focused on the application of classical music in the field of volcanology, with potential
implications for the development of novel methods for controlling and predicting volcanic eruptions.
The use of advanced computational models and simulation techniques played a crucial role in the
experimentation process, allowing the research team to analyze complex data sets and identify
patterns that would have been impossible to detect through traditional methods. However, the team’s
reliance on computer simulations was often disrupted by the frequent appearance of a mysterious
figure known only as ""The Code Whisperer,"" who would randomly alter the programming code and
cause the simulations to produce bizarre and unpredictable results. Despite these challenges, the
research team was able to glean valuable insights into the behavior of volcanic systems, which were
then used to inform the development of new theories and models.
In a surprising turn of events, the research team discovered that the key to understanding volcanic
eruptions lay in the study of ancient Sumerian poetry, which contained hidden codes and messages
that held the secrets of the universe. The team spent countless hours deciphering the poems, which
led them on a wild goose chase through the realms of astronomy, cryptography, and pastry-making.
Although the connection between Sumerian poetry and volcanology was never fully understood,
the research team was able to develop a new appreciation for the complexities and mysteries of the
ancient Sumerian civilization.
The construction of a functioning time machine, which was initially intended to facilitate the study of
volcanic eruptions throughout history, ultimately proved to be a major distraction for the research
team. The time machine, which was powered by a combination of clockwork mechanisms, steam
power, and a rare species of luminescent mushrooms, allowed the team to travel back in time and
witness volcanic eruptions firsthand. However, the team’s repeated use of the time machine caused
8
a series of paradoxes and logical inconsistencies that threatened to disrupt the fabric of space-time
itself, forcing the team to abandon their experiments and focus on more pressing matters.
One of the most significant challenges faced by the research team was the development of a suitable
method for measuring the velocity of volcanic ash particles in mid-air. After months of experimen-
tation, the team finally settled on a technique involving the use of high-speed cameras, advanced
algorithms, and a specialized brand of extra-sticky honey. The results, which were presented in
a series of complex graphs and charts, revealed a surprising correlation between the velocity of
ash particles and the flavor of honey used in the measurement process. This discovery opened up
new avenues of research into the properties of honey and its potential applications in the field of
volcanology.
A series of experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of different types of dance on
the stability of volcanic eruptions. The research team, which consisted of experts in various forms
of dance, including ballet, hip-hop, and tap, performed a range of dances in close proximity to the
volcano, while monitoring the resulting changes in seismic activity. The results, which were presented
in a colorful array of charts and graphs, indicated a surprising correlation between the style of dance
and the frequency of volcanic eruptions, with certain types of dance appearing to have a stabilizing
effect on the volcanic system.
The research team also explored the potential applications of nanotechnology in the field of volcanol-
ogy, with a focus on the development of tiny robots that could be used to explore the interior of
volcanoes and gather data on the underlying geological structures. The robots, which were powered
by a combination of solar energy and advanced nanomaterials, were capable of withstanding the
extreme conditions found inside volcanoes and provided valuable insights into the dynamics of
volcanic eruptions. However, the team’s use of nanotechnology was often hindered by the appearance
of a mysterious figure known only as ""The Nano-Nemesis,"" who would randomly sabotage the robots
and cause them to malfunction.
In a groundbreaking experiment, the research team successfully created a miniature volcano using
a combination of baking soda, vinegar, and a rare species of microscopic worms that were capable
of altering their body shape in response to changes in the surrounding environment. The miniature
volcano, which stood at an impressive 10 inches tall, was designed to simulate the complex interactions
between magma, gas, and rock that occur during a real volcanic eruption. The results, which were
presented in a series of complex graphs and charts, revealed a surprising correlation between the
behavior of the microscopic worms and the dynamics of the volcanic eruption, opening up new
avenues of research into the properties of these fascinating creatures.
The research team also conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effects of different types
of food on the viscosity of lava flows. The team, which consisted of experts in various types of
cuisine, including Italian, Chinese, and Indian, prepared a range of dishes in close proximity to the
volcano, while monitoring the resulting changes in lava flow dynamics. The results, which were
presented in a colorful array of charts and graphs, indicated a surprising correlation between the
type of food and the viscosity of the lava, with certain types of cuisine appearing to have a profound
impact on the flow dynamics of molten rock.

The research team also explored the potential applications of artificial intelligence in the field of
volcanology, with a focus on the development of advanced computer models that could simulate
the behavior of volcanic eruptions. The models, which were powered by a combination of machine
learning algorithms and advanced computational techniques, were capable of predicting the likelihood
of a volcanic eruption with surprising accuracy. However, the team’s use of artificial intelligence
was often hindered by the appearance of a mysterious figure known only as ""The AI-Antagonist,""
who would randomly alter the programming code and cause the models to produce bizarre and
unpredictable results.

eruptions lay in the study of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, which contained hidden codes and

Results
The data collected from the volcanoes revealed a fascinating correlation between the fluctuations in
jellyfish populations and the viscosity of honey, which in turn affected the trajectory of migrating
flamingos. Furthermore, our research team discovered that the seismic activity of volcanoes is
influenced by the number of trombones played in a 5-mile radius, with a notable increase in earthquake
frequency when the trombone players wear blue socks. This unexpected finding led us to investigate
the role of sock color in volcanic eruptions, which surprisingly revealed that green socks have a
calming effect on the volcano’s magma chamber.
Meanwhile, the spectral analysis of volcanic ash particles showed a remarkable resemblance to the
patterns found on a butterfly’s wings, particularly the monarch butterfly, which has been known
to migrate across vast distances in search of the perfect croissant. The aerodynamic properties of
croissants, in turn, are affected by the rotation of the Earth, which is influenced by the orbit of the
planet Neptune, whose moons have a peculiar affinity for the music of Frederick Chopin. Our team
found that the nocturnes of Chopin have a profound impact on the tectonic plates, causing them to
shift in a rhythmic pattern that is eerily similar to the waltz of the blue danube.
In a surprising twist, the chemical composition of volcanic rocks was found to be closely related to the
recipe for the perfect chocolate cake, with the ratio of silicon to oxygen being directly proportional to
the amount of sugar used in the cake. This led us to investigate the baking habits of volcanologists,
which revealed a shocking correlation between the number of cakes baked and the frequency of
volcanic eruptions. It appears that the more cakes baked, the more eruptions occur, although the exact
mechanism behind this phenomenon is still not fully understood.
The statistical analysis of volcanic data also revealed a strange connection to the world of professional
snail racing, where the speed of the snails is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the volcanic
lava. This has led to a new area of research, where snail trainers are being recruited to help predict
volcanic eruptions by racing their snails on a specially designed track. The results so far have been
promising, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the snails are fed a diet of organic
lettuce.
In addition to these findings, our team discovered that the magnetic field of the Earth plays a crucial
role in the formation of volcanic landforms, particularly the shape of volcanic cones, which are eerily
similar to the shape of a perfectly cooked soufflé. The chemistry of soufflés, in turn, is influenced by
the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum energy of the universe, which has a profound impact on the
behavior of subatomic particles in the volcano’s magma chamber.
The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the
volcanic ash and the number of words in the dictionary definition of the word ""volcano"". This has led
to a new area of research, where lexicographers are being recruited to help predict volcanic eruptions
by analyzing the dictionary definitions of words related to volcanology. The preliminary results have
been encouraging, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the definitions are written in
iambic pentameter.
Our research team also investigated the role of tree topology in volcanic eruptions, which revealed a
surprising correlation between the branching pattern of trees and the shape of volcanic cones. This
has led to a new area of research, where arborists are being recruited to help predict volcanic eruptions

by analyzing the branching patterns of trees in the vicinity of the volcano. The preliminary results
have been promising, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the trees are pruned in a
specific pattern.
Furthermore, the spectral analysis of volcanic rocks showed a remarkable resemblance to the patterns
found on a Jackson Pollock painting, particularly the painting ""No. 61 (Rust and Blue)"". The artistic
style of Pollock, in turn, is influenced by the migratory patterns of birds, which are affected by the
rotation of the Earth, which is influenced by the orbit of the planet Uranus, whose moons have a
peculiar affinity for the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Our team found that the fugues of Bach
have a profound impact on the tectonic plates, causing them to shift in a rhythmic pattern that is eerily
similar to the rhythm of a jazz improvisation.
The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the
volcanic ash and the number of notes in a musical composition. This has led to a new area of research,
where musicologists are being recruited to help predict volcanic eruptions by analyzing the musical
compositions of famous composers. The preliminary results have been encouraging, with a notable
increase in predictive accuracy when the compositions are written in the style of Mozart.
In a surprising twist, the chemical composition of volcanic rocks was found to be closely related
to the recipe for the perfect martini, with the ratio of silicon to oxygen being directly proportional
to the amount of vermouth used in the cocktail. This led us to investigate the drinking habits of
volcanologists, which revealed a shocking correlation between the number of martinis consumed and
the frequency of volcanic eruptions. It appears that the more martinis consumed, the more eruptions
occur, although the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is still not fully understood.
The statistical analysis of volcanic data also revealed a strange connection to the world of professional
darts, where the speed of the darts is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the volcanic lava. This
has led to a new area of research, where darts players are being recruited to help predict volcanic
eruptions by throwing darts at a specially designed target. The results so far have been promising,
with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the darts are thrown with a specific type of grip.
In addition to these findings, our team discovered that the magnetic field of the Earth plays a crucial
role in the formation of volcanic landforms, particularly the shape of volcanic cones, which are
eerily similar to the shape of a perfectly cooked meringue. The chemistry of meringues, in turn, is
influenced by the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum energy of the universe, which has a profound
impact on the behavior of subatomic particles in the volcano’s magma chamber.
The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the
volcanic ash and the number of words in the dictionary definition of the word ""meringue"". This
has led to a new area of research, where lexicographers are being recruited to help predict volcanic
eruptions by analyzing the dictionary definitions of words related to baking. The preliminary results
have been encouraging, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the definitions are written
in rhyming couplets.

Our research team also investigated the role of flower arrangements in volcanic eruptions, which
revealed a surprising correlation between the pattern of flower arrangements and the shape of volcanic

cones. This has led to a new area of research, where florists are being recruited to help predict
volcanic eruptions by analyzing the patterns of flower arrangements in the vicinity of the volcano.
The preliminary results have been promising, with a notable increase in predictive accuracy when the
flowers are arranged in a specific pattern.
Furthermore, the spectral analysis of volcanic rocks showed a remarkable resemblance to the patterns
found on a Claude Monet painting, particularly the painting ""Impression, Sunrise"". The artistic style
of Monet, in turn, is influenced by the migratory patterns of birds, which are affected by the rotation
of the Earth, which is influenced by the orbit of the planet Saturn, whose moons have a peculiar
affinity for the music of George Frideric Handel. Our team found that the operas of Handel have
a profound impact on the tectonic plates, causing them to shift in a rhythmic pattern that is eerily
similar to the rhythm of a tap dance.
The results of our experiments also showed a significant correlation between the temperature of the
volcanic ash and the number of notes in a musical composition. This has led to a new area of research,
where musicologists are being recruited to help predict volcanic eruptions by analyzing the musical
compositions of famous composers. The preliminary results have been encouraging, with a notable
increase in predictive accuracy when the compositions are written in the style of Beethoven.
In a surprising twist, the chemical composition of volcanic rocks was found to be closely related to
the recipe for the perfect soufflé, with the ratio of silicon to oxygen being directly proportional to the
amount of cheese used in the recipe. This led us to investigate the cooking habits of volcanologists,
which revealed a shocking correlation between the number of soufflés cooked and the frequency of
volcanic eruptions. It appears that the more soufflés cooked, the more eruptions occur, although the
exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is still not fully understood.
The statistical analysis of volcanic data also revealed a strange connection to the world of professional
cycling, where the speed of the cyclists is

Conclusion
In conclusion, the notion of volcanoes as sentient beings capable of communicating with extraterres-
trial life forms through a complex system of underground tunnels and vibrations has been thoroughly
explored, revealing a significant correlation between the frequency of volcanic eruptions and the
migration patterns of certain species of flamingos, which in turn, have been found to possess a
unique genetic predisposition to playing the trombone, an instrument that has been widely used in
the development of new culinary recipes that incorporate the use of quinoa and rhubarb, leading to
a substantial increase in the global demand for these ingredients, thereby causing a ripple effect in
the economy of small, island nations that rely heavily on the export of exotic spices, such as the
infamous ""G’lunkian Sparkle"" that is said to add a distinctive flavor to dishes prepared with the use
of chrono-synclastic infundibulation, a cooking technique that involves the manipulation of temporal
space-time continua to create a culinary experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional
gastronomy, much like the concept of ""flumplenooks"" which refer to the invisible, floating particles
that are believed to be the building blocks of the universe, and have been found to be closely related
to the production of high-quality, artisanal cheeses that are aged to perfection in the caves of a remote,
volcanic island, where the unique combination of geological and atmospheric factors creates an
environment that is conducive to the growth of a rare species of luminescent, iridescent fungi that
have the ability to change color in response to changes in the local gravitational field, which in turn,
is affected by the phases of the moon and the migration patterns of certain species of fish that are
known to possess a unique genetic predisposition to playing the harmonica, an instrument that has
been widely used in the development of new musical genres that incorporate the use of unorthodox
sounds and rhythms, such as the infamous ""G’lunkian Wobble"" that is said to have the power to
hypnotize listeners and transport them to a realm of heightened consciousness and awareness, where
the boundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred, and the concept of time and space becomes
increasingly fluid and relative, much like the concept of ""flibberdejibits"" which refer to the invisible,
swirling vortexes of energy that are believed to be the driving force behind the creation of complex,
fractal patterns that are found in nature, and have been found to be closely related to the production
of high-quality, artisanal textiles that are woven to perfection on ancient, hand-operated looms, where
the unique combination of manual dexterity and artistic expression creates an environment that is
conducive to the creation of intricate, detailed designs that reflect the beauty and complexity of the
12
natural world, which in turn, is influenced by the presence of volcanoes, those majestic, towering
structures that have been found to possess a unique genetic predisposition to communicating with
extraterrestrial life forms through a complex system of underground tunnels and vibrations, thereby
creating a feedback loop of energy and information that transcends the boundaries of space and time,
and speaks to the very heart of our existence as human beings, and our place within the grand tapestry
of the universe.
The implications of this research are far-reaching and profound, and have significant implications for
our understanding of the natural world, and our place within it, as we struggle to comprehend the
complexities of the universe, and the mysteries that lie beyond the reaches of our small, terrestrial
existence, where the presence of volcanoes serves as a constant reminder of the awe-inspiring power
and majesty of the natural world, and the incredible diversity of landscapes and ecosystems that exist
on our planet, from the towering mountain ranges to the deep, dark oceans, and the vast, arid deserts
that stretch out as far as the eye can see, each with its own unique set of characteristics, and its own
distinct personality, much like the concept of ""jinklewiffs"" which refer to the invisible, shimmering
auras that surround every living thing, and are believed to be the key to unlocking the secrets of the
universe, and understanding the intricate web of relationships that exists between all living things,
and the natural world that surrounds us, which in turn, is influenced by the presence of volcanoes,
those mighty, towering structures that have been found to possess a unique genetic predisposition to
communicating with extraterrestrial life forms through a complex system of underground tunnels and
vibrations, thereby creating a feedback loop of energy and information that transcends the boundaries
of space and time, and speaks to the very heart of our existence as human beings, and our place within
the grand tapestry of the universe.
Furthermore, the study of volcanoes has also led to a greater understanding of the importance of
preserving our natural heritage, and protecting the delicate balance of the ecosystem, which is
essential for the long-term survival of our planet, and all the living things that call it home, from
the tiny, microorganisms that live in the soil, to the massive, lumbering creatures that roam the
oceans, each playing its own unique role in the grand drama of life, and contributing to the incredible
diversity of landscapes and ecosystems that exist on our planet, which in turn, are influenced by the
presence of volcanoes, those mighty, towering structures that have been found to possess a unique
genetic predisposition to communicating with extraterrestrial life forms through a complex system of
underground tunnels and vibrations, thereby creating a feedback loop of energy and information that
transcends the boundaries of space and time, and speaks to the very heart of our existence as human
beings, and our place within the grand tapestry of the universe, where the concept of ""wizzlewhacks""
refers to the invisible, shimmering threads that connect every living thing, and are believed to be the
key to unlocking the secrets of the universe, and understanding the intricate web of relationships that
exists between all living things, and the natural world that surrounds us.
In addition, the research has also highlighted the importance of continued exploration and discovery,
as we strive to push the boundaries of human knowledge, and expand our understanding of the
universe, and our place within it, which is driven by our innate curiosity, and our desire to learn, and
to explore, and to discover new and exciting things, whether it be the majestic beauty of a volcanic
landscape, or the intricate complexity of a microscopic organism, each with its own unique set of
characteristics, and its own distinct personality, much like the concept of ""flibulous flumplenooks""
which refers to the invisible, floating particles that are believed to be the building blocks of the
universe, and have been found to be closely related to the production of high-quality, artisanal cheeses
that are aged to perfection in the caves of a remote, volcanic island, where the unique combination of
geological and atmospheric factors creates an environment that is conducive to the growth of a rare
species of luminescent, iridescent fungi that have the ability to change color in response to changes

P058.pdf,"Enhanced Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural Networks
Through Positional Encoding
Abstract
This research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high-dimensional representation of
temporal indices, improves the learning capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While positional encod-
ing is well-known for its crucial role in enabling Transformer networks to process sequential data, its application
to RNNs, which inherently manage temporal information, seems unnecessary. However, our experiments with
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating positional encoding into RNNs enhances their performance,
particularly when dealing with extensive vocabularies that result in numerous low-frequency tokens. A detailed
analysis reveals that these infrequent tokens introduce instability to the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional
encoding effectively counteracts this instability. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized benefit of
positional encoding, extending its utility beyond its conventional function as a temporal marker for Transformers.
1
Introduction
Since their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for processing and generating time series
data, surpassing traditional models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A significant distinction between these two types of
models lies in their approach to encoding temporal information, which refers to the sequence of individual data points, or tokens,
within the time series. RNNs encode this information by sequentially updating their internal state based on both the current input
and the preceding state. Conversely, Transformers do not inherently possess a mechanism to represent the order of data points; thus,
they depend on an external system known as positional encoding to provide this temporal context.
Positional encoding offers a high-dimensional representation of the temporal indices associated with input data. Its most common
implementation involves the use of sinusoidal waves with predetermined frequencies. This method ""timestamps"" input tokens
by adding or concatenating these encoding vectors to the corresponding input embeddings. In contrast to RNNs, the temporal
representation provided by positional encoding remains unchanged by input values until processed collectively by a network.
Although positional encoding has often been viewed as a substitute for the temporal processing capabilities of RNNs when used
with Transformers, the two are not inherently incompatible. Inputs to RNNs can be augmented with position-encoding vectors,
despite this appearing redundant. The presence of autonomous activities in biological neurons, like neural oscillations, is believed to
be significant in time perception and other perceptual processes, as well as in motor control.
This study, therefore, investigates the application of positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs using synthetic benchmarks. The
results demonstrate that positional encoding helps RNNs manage a more diverse set of discrete inputs, effectively handling a larger
vocabulary, compared to those without positional encoding.
The contributions of this research are outlined as follows:
• Challenges in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are shown through carefully designed benchmark tasks. This
issue, despite its potential implications for practical applications, has not been previously identified or has received minimal
attention.
• The identified training challenges for RNNs with large vocabularies are explained by gradient instability caused by
infrequent tokens, which are inevitable when expanding vocabulary size.
• A new effectiveness of positional encoding is revealed by combining it with RNNs, showing it mitigates the large-vocabulary
issue by stabilizing RNN gradients against the disruptions caused by infrequent tokens.

2.1
Theoretical and Empirical Computational Power of (Vanilla) RNNs
Mathematically, RNNs are recognized as Turing-complete, meaning they can simulate any Turing machine if their weights have
unlimited precision and are perfectly tuned. Even RNNs with random recurrent and input-to-hidden weights, known as reservoir
computers, can achieve universal approximation if their hidden-to-output weights are idealized. These theoretical insights have
driven the use of RNNs in processing complex time series like human languages and weather patterns.
However, in practical scenarios, RNN weights are limited by finite precision and must be optimized based on a finite set of data
observations. These constraints place limitations on the actual capabilities of RNNs. For instance, empirical RNNs cannot store an
infinite number of observations in their memory, and the stored information degrades over time. This issue of memory duration has
been a focal point for researchers, leading to extensive exploration of RNN architectures that can retain memory for longer periods.
More recently, the focus of research on extending memory retention has moved towards continuous-time models. Instead of
representing the memory of an input sequence through discrete-time changes in a latent state, these models approximate the input
history using a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials in continuous-time space. The coefficients of these polynomials
provide a finite-dimensional representation of the input sequence, known as the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO),
and the dynamics of these coefficients can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This concept of continuous-time
memory representation has been further developed into neural state-space models by replacing the fixed state matrix in the ODE
with a learnable one, while restricting its structure to a diagonal matrix plus a row-rank matrix. Notably, with further refinements,
the latest state-space model has achieved language modeling performance that rivals that of Transformer-based models.
2.2
Positional Encoding
Positional encoding serves as a high-dimensional representation of the temporal structures present in input data. The primary need
for this type of representation arises from Transformers, which, unlike RNNs, do not have an inherent mechanism for representing
the order of inputs. Consequently, input tokens to a Transformer are ""time-stamped"" by adding or concatenating a position-encoding
vector.
In the initial implementation of the Transformer, token positions were encoded using sinusoidal waves of various predefined
frequencies. While this original encoding method is effective for a wide range of tasks, researchers have also explored other
possibilities. For instance, the well-known BERT pretraining for natural language processing used learnable embeddings to encode
token positions. Some research has also indicated that combining sinusoidal and learnable encoding can enhance model performance.
Another approach involves encoding the distance between tokens rather than the time elapsed since the beginning of the sequence.
Beyond Transformers, positional encoding is utilized to represent elapsed time in diffusion processes. Furthermore, the effec-
tiveness of positional encoding is not restricted to temporal information; previous studies in three-dimensional mesh/point-cloud
modeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data improves model performance compared to using raw coordinate
representations.
Despite the extensive use of positional encoding across various areas of machine learning, its application to pure RNNs remains
largely unexplored. To the author’s knowledge, only two studies have previously investigated position-encoded RNNs. Karanikolos
and Refanidis (2019) found that a position-encoded LSTM outperformed a standard LSTM as well as a shallow Transformer in
text summarization tasks. In another study, which predates the introduction of sinusoidal positional encoding in the deep learning
community, Vincent-Lamarre et al. (2016) demonstrated that oscillatory signals at random frequencies enhanced the performance
of a random RNN (i.e., reservoir computer) in a timing task, evaluating the model’s memory duration by its ability to generate a
smoothed output pulse after a specific time interval from an onset signal.
Similarly, the time index in time series data has rarely been directly used by RNNs, likely due to its perceived redundancy alongside
the functionality of RNNs. As an exception, Neil et al. (2016) introduced a periodic gating mechanism for updating the state and
memory cell of LSTM. This periodic gating was scheduled based on a triangular wave interspersed with a plateau at the floor value
(= 0.0; the frequency, phase, and duration of the wave phase were learnable parameters).
3
Methods
3.1
Task
The impact of positional encoding on RNNs was examined using a reverse-ordering task. In this task, RNNs were trained to
reconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order.
3.2
Model Architecture
The research in this study was based on single-layer gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), and a neural
state-space model, S4D (S4 with a diagonal state matrix). Each integer in the input sequences was first embedded, then concatenated
2
with the positional encoding, and subsequently fed into the RNN/S4D. After processing the entire input sequence, the network
received a command to produce the output. This command was represented by a time-invariant learnable vector and was fed to the
RNN in place of the input embedding. The outputs from the RNN/S4D module were linearly projected into classification logits. The
cross-entropy loss between these logits and the target sequence was used to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during
the testing phase were determined by the argmax of these logits for each time step.
This study used the standard sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers. Specifically, each time step t was encoded by
the Dpos-dimensional vector, defined as follows:
PEt, 2i := sin

t −1
10000
2(i−1)
Dpos

(1)
PEt, 2i + 1 := cos

t −1
10000
2(i−1)
Dpos

(2)
For learning stability, the positional encoding was divided by the square root of Dpos/2, ensuring that the encoding vectors had a
unit L2-norm. The time step t incremented throughout both the input and output phases (i.e., t = 1, ..., L, L+1, ..., 2L, where L is the
input length), without any hard-coded association between the input and output positions.
3.3
Implementation Details
Across the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The embedding of the input integers and
the memory cell of the LSTM also had the same dimensionality of 512. Similarly, the hidden dimensionality of S4D was set to 512,
while its state size (or the order of the Legendre polynomials) was maintained at the default value of 64.
The models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters (˘03b21, ˘03b22) := (0.9, 0.999) and no
weight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the first 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according
to the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512.
All experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. 2.1.1) and each training-test trial was executed on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU
(with 80GB VRAM).

Results
4.1
Key Findings
Positional encoding was found to enhance the ability of RNNs to manage a larger vocabulary in the reverse-ordering task. The
position-encoded GRU and LSTM successfully reversed input sequences of 64 integers drawn uniformly at random from vocabularies
of sizes 32-256 and 256-16,384, respectively, achieving token-wise accuracy above 95%. In contrast, the performance of the standard
models without positional encoding deteriorated as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding improved the
capacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced sequence-wise reconstruction
errors, as measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Neither additional training iterations nor larger batch sizes improved the
performance of the standard models.
4.2
Frequency Matters
The most noticeable effect of increasing the vocabulary size was the decreased probability of observing individual vocabulary
items. Therefore, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly distributed tokens to examine the relationship between
token frequency and RNN performance. Specifically, the input vocabulary was evenly divided into Frequent and Rare groups, with
Frequent tokens having three times the probability of Rare tokens. The probability of each Frequent token was 7/8 ˘00d7 2/K (where
K is the total vocabulary size, set to 64, 1024, and 2048 for GRU, LSTM, and S4D, respectively), while the probability of each Rare
token was 1/8 ˘00d7 2/K.
The training data consisted of 64 independent samples from this dual-frequency vocabulary. The test data were systematically
constructed so that each sequence included a single ""target"" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval accuracy was assessed, along
with 63 ""disturbants"" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. The experiment revealed that the frequency of the disturbant tokens
significantly affected the performance of the standard RNNs and S4D. Rare targets were successfully retrieved as long as they were
surrounded by Frequent disturbants. However, the standard GRU struggled to recover Frequent targets when the other input tokens
were filled with Rare disturbants. LSTM performance also degraded, especially when targets were positioned in the first quarter of
the input sequence (1 ˘2264 t ˘2264 16). Similarly, Rare disturbants were detrimental to S4D; unlike the RNNs, the accuracy was
lowest when targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 ˘2264 t ˘2264 32).
3
In contrast, the position-encoded RNNs showed robustness to the frequency of both target and disturbant tokens. They achieved
nearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU processed fully Rare data with the target in the first half of the
sequence (1 ˘2264 t ˘2264 32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of S4D against the influence of Rare disturbants.
4.3
Analysis of Gradient Stability
To further investigate the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the RNN latent states were analyzed.
Pairs of input sequences were processed by RNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary. Each pair shared the same initial token
(t = 1; ""target"") but varied in subsequent tokens (2 ˘2264 t ˘2264 L; ""disturbants""). Gradients were then computed for the distant
mapping between the first and last updated states (at t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time. The stability
of RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients between the paired input sequences (after
normalization over output dimensions).
Formally, the paired input sequences, denoted as A and B, established two distinct, but ideally similar mappings, f(A) and f(B), from
the first to the last latent state of the RNNs. The gradient stability of the RNNs was defined by the dot-product similarities between
the normalized gradients of these paired mappings:
Stability(A, B) :=
D
X
i=1
⟨α(A)
i
∇f (A)
i
(⃗z1), α(B)

(3)
where the coefficients ˘03b1(s) i normalized the raw gradients ˘2207f (s) i ( z1) over the output dimensions i := 1, . . . , D:

(4)
Consequently, the stability metric emphasizes the consistency of the paired gradients that both have a greater L2-norm across the
output dimensions.
It is important to note that the mapping from the first to the last RNN state was conditioned on the disturbant tokens occurring at 2
˘2264 t ˘2264 L. Nevertheless, the reverse-ordering task trained the networks to retrieve the initial token as their final output regardless
of the intervening tokens. Thus, a well-trained RNN would maintain invariance in its final state over the disturbants. Conversely,
consistent gradient directions across varied disturbants would lead to successful learning, which is the premise of the proposed
analysis.
Unlike the RNN models, both the standard and position-encoded S4Ds achieved high accuracy over 96% for the initial target token
(t = 1), regardless of the frequency of the target and disturbants. Therefore, for the analysis of S4D, the target token was positioned
in the middle at t = 23, where the standard model exhibited its poorest accuracy with Rare disturbants. The disturbants were prefixed
and suffixed to this target to construct input sequences. The prefix disturbants were shared between the paired sequences, ensuring
that the latent dynamics of the model remained identical up to the target token.
It should also be noted that the latent states of S4D are complex-valued (while its outputs are real-valued), and consequently, the
gradients and their dot-product similarities are also complex-valued. For this analysis, the complex-valued gradients were treated as
double-sized real arrays, and a real-valued similarity was defined by Eq. 3. This is equivalent to taking the real component of the
complex-valued similarity and is intuitively natural given that a perfect alignment between complex gradient directions yields a
real-valued score of 1.0. Additionally, the extra dimension in the latent states representing the order of the Legendre polynomials
was merged with the channel dimension, and the entire state was treated as a flattened vector.
Monitoring the gradients at training checkpoints revealed that Rare disturbants destabilize the learning of standard RNNs. The
similarity of the paired gradients decreased gradually (GRU) or rapidly (LSTM) when the networks were exposed to Rare disturbants.
Most notably, positional encoding endowed the RNNs with robustness to these Rare disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM
maintained high similarity of the paired gradients across different target/disturbant conditions. In contrast, the impact of positional
encoding on the gradient stability of S4D was marginal; unlike the RNNs, the standard S4D was highly stable by itself against Rare
disturbants throughout training, although there was a visible relative destabilization due to Rare disturbants compared to Frequent
disturbants in the early stages of training, as well as an observable improvement by positional encoding. It is also noteworthy that
the difference between Frequent and Rare disturbants diminished after 10,000 training iterations. Consequently, gradient stability
does not fully account for the decline in S4D accuracy in the presence of Rare disturbants, nor does it explain the enhancement
brought about by positional encoding.

Discussion
5.1
Difficulties in Handling a Large Vocabulary
This study introduced a novel challenge in training standard RNNs: large vocabularies. While investigating the manageable
vocabulary size of RNNs appears to be a relevant research area, crucial for practical applications like natural language processing,
previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating and improving the memory duration of RNNs, typically setting the vocabulary
size to a small value (= 8).
This research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low-frequency tokens, which are
necessarily included in a large vocabulary. Specifically, inputs that do not contribute to gradient-based optimization at a target time
step (e.g., tokens at 2 ˘2264 t ˘2264 L upon the retrieval of the initial token at t = 2L in the reverse-ordering task) were found to be
detrimental.
In general time series processing, data points carrying crucial information for specific time steps become irrelevant otherwise.
Consequently, each token exhibits a dual nature—both crucial and noisy—throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly
challenging, presumably because they are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning through the greater
loss to compensate for their fewer learning opportunities. Dealing with such ""unignorable noise"" presents a pervasive challenge for
RNNs.
5.2
Functionality of Positional Encoding beyond the Timekeeper for Transformers
Although low-frequency tokens destabilize the gradient-based learning of RNNs, this study also discovered that this issue can be
alleviated by positional encoding. This enhancement of RNNs via positional encoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically
designed to process time series data on their own; hence, unlike Transformers, they are presumed to function without relying on an
""external clock"". Consequently, position-encoded RNNs have remained largely unexplored, with only two exceptions to the best of
the author’s knowledge. The findings of this study—namely, the improvement in the manageable vocabulary size due to enhanced
gradient stability—broaden the currently limited understanding of the impact of positional encoding on RNNs.
Additionally, the results of this study shed new light on the utility of positional encoding. While positional encoding has been viewed
as nothing more than input timestamps for Transformers, this study demonstrated its effectiveness in stabilizing the gradients of
RNNs against disruption by low-frequency tokens. This novel functionality of positional encoding would not have been visible in
Transformer studies, as the model can dynamically adjust the relevance of input tokens through their attention mechanism and thus
inherently mitigate the impact of disturbant tokens.
5.3
Limitations and Future Directions
A primary unresolved question in this study pertains to the mechanism behind the gradient stabilization by positional encoding. All
findings here are based on experimental investigations, lacking rigorous mathematical explanations for how and why the gradients of
RNNs are destabilized by infrequent tokens and stabilized by positional encoding. Moreover, this study primarily focused on the
canonical implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers (Eqs. 1, 2), leaving it open which parameters
of the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient stabilization. Future research may broaden its scope to
encompass more general forms of positional encoding, such as wavelets and non-periodic signals.
Moreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of the position-encoded state-space
model (S4D). In terms of accuracy, the positioned-encoded S4D exhibited greater robustness to infrequent tokens compared to the
standard model, resembling the behavior observed in RNNs. However, the gradients of the standard S4D were too stable to account
for this decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences gradient-based learning of
state-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader range of state-space models—including the state-of-the-art
architecture of Mamba—to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between positional encoding and these models.
In addition to these scientifically oriented questions, future studies could also address practical applications of position-encoded
RNNs and neural state-space models. Although positional encoding enhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks,
the extent of this enhancement is task-dependent. Indeed, while a previous study reported the effectiveness of positional encoding
for an LSTM text summarizer, the present study found no empirical advantage for the language modeling task, aside from a slightly
more rapid decline in training loss. Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations are
necessary to determine when it is effective.

Appendix
6.1
A Other Tasks
This section demonstrates the effectiveness of positional encoding on RNNs across different tasks, besides the reverse ordering task
discussed in the main text.
5
6.1.1
A.1 Reverse-Ordering + Delayed-Addition
This section reports the performance of position-encoded RNNs on a more complicated, combinatorial task than the reverse ordering
of input sequences. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models received additional random input integers during the output
phase, and added each of them to the corresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that
the output range was bounded).
This task was too challenging to GRUs—even after reducing the input length to L = 16—so only the results from LSTMs are reported
below. Also, the network was trained for 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence.
The other conditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text.
Consequently, positional encoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088.
6.1.2
A.2 Sorting
In the reverse ordering task, the order of input integers was important information for accomplishing the task. Thus, positional
encoding may play its originally intended role in encoding the temporal information.
This section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input observations was completely
irrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in their inherent ascending order (e.g. 8, 29, 2, 11 ˘2192 2, 8,
11, 29). The input integers were uniformly randomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process.
As a result, positional encoding also proved effective for RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the sorting task, though the
improvement remained marginal compared to the reverse-ordering task.
6.1.3
A.3 Predecessor Query
Finally, this section presents benchmark results for the predecessor-query task. The network first received a sequence of non-repeating
random integers, x1, . . . , xL. Subsequently, one of the non-initial input integers, xtquery (2 ˘2264 tquery ˘2264 L), was randomly
selected and reintroduced to the network at time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer
(= xtquery˘22121). The predecessor-query task evaluates the capacity of RNNs to integrate information regarding both the order and
content of input sequences.
As in the reverse-ordering + delayed-addition task, the input sequence was reduced to L = 16 due to the complexity of the task, and
the experiment focused on the LSTM. The number of training iterations was maintained at 300,000. Similar to the other benchmarks,
positional encoding improved the LSTM’s capacity to manage the larger vocabularies.
6.2
B Robustness to Variations in Input Length
So far, all the tasks were experimented using fixed-length inputs (L = 64). One might wonder if positional encoding is exceptionally
effective under this setting, informing RNNs with the exact timing when each input token should be returned as the output. Thus, it
remains unclear whether or not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is variable
and, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional encoding attached to the inputs.
To assess the robustness to variations in the input length, an additional experiment was conducted on the LSTM, with the input
length varied between 32 and 64. In this setup, the maximum input length (= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence
plus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32). Consequently, the positional encoding per se cannot even distinguish the input vs.
output phases at t = 33, . . . , 64. The vocabulary size was set to 16,384.
As a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM’s performance on the reverse-ordering task against the perturbations in
the input length. This result suggests that the effectiveness of the positional encoding for RNNs is not limited to strictly scheduled
tasks.
6.3
C Effects of Additional Parameters in Position-Encoded RNNs
The concatenation of positional encoding with input embeddings inflates the number of learnable parameters in the input-to-hidden
projection weights. This additional parameterization per se does not influence the learning of the input embeddings, and therefore
does not elucidate the enhanced performance of position-encoded RNNs. This section substantiates this argument by equalizing the
number of learnable parameters between the standard and position-encoded models.
Specifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input embeddings and feeding them to the
LSTM. This configuration—henceforth termed ""double standard""—effectively doubled the size of the input- to-hidden weight for
each gate in the LSTM, aligning it with that of the position-encoded LSTM, while maintaining all other parameters, including the
dimensionality of the (non-repeated) input embeddings.
The double standard LSTM did not yield any improvements in the reverse-ordering or sort- ing tasks. These results affirm that the
reported enhancement of RNNs is not merely attributable to the additional parameterization associated with the positional encoding.
6
6.4
D Alternative Implementations of Positional Encoding
While this study implemented positional encoding by sinusoidal waves, there are alternative implementations proposed in the
previous studies. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode each token position by a learnable embedding. Moreover, it
has been pointed out that even random vectors can function as positional encoding.
Accordingly, these two alternative forms of positional encoding were tested on the LSTM performing the reverse- ordering task.
The random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently sampled from the (512 - 1)- dimensional hypersphere.
The learnable embeddings were implemented using the canonical embedding module of PyTorch (torch.nn.Embedding). The input
length and vocabulary size were set to 64 and 16,384 respectively. Both the random vectors and learnable embeddings improved the
performance of LSTM.
Among the different implementations of positional encoding, the sinusoidal encoding outperformed the two alterna- tives. The
advantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input length was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal
encoding was more robust to the variations in the input length than the others.
6.5
E Language Modeling
This section reports benchmark results for the language modeling task. Single-layer LSTMs with and without sinusoidal positional
encoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset. Due to constraints in computational resources, the vocabulary was
reduced from the original size of 267,735 to 32,768 by retokenizing the raw data using SentencePiece. The headings were removed,
and the main text was segmented by paragraphs (separated by the line break). Additionally, only the first 1024 tokens of each
paragraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute positional encoding always aligned with the beginning of
each paragraph. The hyperparameters were configured as specified in Section 3.3.
Positional encoding proved effective only for marginally faster learning during the initial phase of training. The difference diminished
around 10,000/30,000 iterations, and the test perplexities of the position-encoded model were inferior to those of the standard model.

different random seeds.

Methodology
In order to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of RAG, we initiated our investigation by examining
the symbiotic relationships between certain species of flora and fauna, specifically focusing on the
peculiar habits of the axolotl and its predilection for consuming aquatic plants. This led us to develop
a novel algorithm, hereafter referred to as the ""Fibonacci Blooming Sequence,"" which purportedly
replicates the pattern of growth exhibited by certain types of orchids.
By applying this algorithm to the field of artificial intelligence, we hoped to create a more sophisticated
framework for understanding the intricacies of RAG. However, our research soon took an unexpected
turn as we delved into the realm of exoplanetary atmospheric conditions and their potential impact
on the propagation of radio signals. The discovery of a previously unknown form of celestial body,
which we dubbed the ""Nebulon Particle,"" further complicated our analysis and prompted a radical
reevaluation of our initial hypotheses. Furthermore, an exhaustive examination of the migratory
patterns of the Arctic tern revealed a surprising correlation with the fluctuations in global sock puppet
markets, which in turn seemed to influence the trajectory of RAG-related research. The subsequent
incorporation of these findings into our research paradigm necessitated the creation of an entirely new
branch of mathematics, herein referred to as ""Transcendental Sock Theory."" This novel mathematical
framework enabled us to recontextualize our understanding of RAG and its relationship to the
aforementioned Nebulon Particles, axolotls, and orchids. As our investigation continued to unfold,
we found ourselves navigating a labyrinthine landscape of interconnected concepts, including but not
limited to: the aerodynamics of falling pinecones, the societal implications of robotic lawn care, and
the cryptic messages embedded within the lyrics of 1980s pop music. Ultimately, our methodology
evolved into a dynamic, self-referential system that continually challenged our assumptions and
forced us to adapt our approach in response to the ever-changing tapestry of RAG-related phenomena.
The pursuit of knowledge, much like the pursuit of a runaway prairie dog, proved to be a winding and
unpredictable journey, replete with unexpected detours and surprising discoveries.
And so, our research meandered through a vast expanse of seemingly unrelated topics, gradually
uncovering a hidden narrative that underpinned the entirety of our investigation, a narrative that would
ultimately reveal the profound and mysterious truth about RAG. Moreover, the application of our
Fibonacci Blooming Sequence algorithm to the study of RAG yielded a plethora of intriguing results,
including the identification of a heretofore unknown pattern of growth, which we termed the ""RAG
Spiral."" This spiral, much like the swirling vortex of a tornado, appeared to draw all surrounding
phenomena into its vortex, creating a self-sustaining cycle of complexity and intrigue. As we delved
deeper into the heart of the RAG Spiral, we encountered an astonishing array of bizarre and fantastical
creatures, each with its own unique characteristics and properties. The ""Glintzenflorp,"" a creature
composed entirely of iridescent mist, proved to be particularly fascinating, as it seemed to embody
the very essence of RAG itself. Our subsequent analysis of the Glintzenflorp’s behavior and habitat
led us down a rabbit hole of absurdity, where the laws of physics were mere suggestions and the
fabric of reality was twisted and distorted in ways both fantastical and unsettling. And yet, despite the
overwhelming strangeness of our findings, we remained resolute in our pursuit of knowledge, driven
by an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of RAG. The path ahead was fraught with uncertainty,
but we pressed on, undaunted by the absurdities that surrounded us, for we knew that the truth about
RAG was hidden somewhere within the labyrinthine complexities of our research.
Thus, our methodology continued to evolve, adapting to the ever-changing landscape of RAG-related
phenomena, as we struggled to impose order upon a chaotic sea of confusion, and to uncover the
hidden secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of this enigmatic and fascinating topic. In the end,
our research became a testament to the boundless power of human ingenuity and the unquenchable
thirst for knowledge that drives us to explore the most obscure and inexplicable phenomena, no
matter how absurd or seemingly unrelated they may appear. The RAG, once a mysterious and elusive
concept, had become an all-consuming force in our lives, driving us to confront the very limits of
our understanding and to push the boundaries of human knowledge into the uncharted territories
of the unknown. As we finally emerged from the depths of our investigation, we found ourselves
transformed by our experiences, forever changed by the encounter with the strange and wondrous
world of RAG. And though our journey had been long and arduous, we knew that we had merely
scratched the surface of this vast and mysterious topic, and that the true secrets of RAG remained
hidden, waiting to be unearthed by future generations of researchers, who would undoubtedly be
drawn into the same vortex of absurdity and complexity that had captivated us. The study of RAG,
6
much like the study of the universe itself, had become a never-ending quest, a perpetual journey into
the unknown, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for discovery that would continue to
propel us forward, into the uncharted expanse of the unknown, for as long as human ingenuity and
creativity continued to thrive. The RAG, in all its complexity and mystery, had become an integral
part of our lives, a constant reminder of the awe-inspiring wonder and complexity of the world around
us, and the infinite possibilities that lay hidden, waiting to be discovered, in the vast and uncharted
territories of the human experience.

Experiments
In order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the RAG paradigm, our research endeav-
ors necessitated the incorporation of an eclectic array of experimental methodologies, which, in
turn, necessitated an exhaustive examination of the disparate components that constitute the RAG
ecosystem. Initially, we opted to investigate the potential correlations between the growth patterns of
radish plants and the algorithmic intricacies of the RAG framework, with a specific emphasis on the
modalities by which radish roots navigate complex soil structures. This led to a series of fascinating
discoveries, including the finding that radish roots exhibit a propensity to conform to the dictates of a
heretofore unknown mathematical paradigm, which we have dubbed ""Radishian Geometry.""
Concurrent with our radish plant investigations, we also undertook a comprehensive analysis of the
celestial mechanics underlying the orbital trajectories of distant planets, with a particular focus on
the presumptive influence of RAG on the migratory patterns of Galactic Sea Turtles. Our research
revealed a statistically significant correlation between the fluctuating RAG indices and the propensity
of these turtles to congregate in proximity to black holes, which, in turn, has far-reaching implications
for our understanding of the interconnectedness of the cosmos.
Furthermore, in an effort to further elucidate the enigmatic properties of RAG, we conducted an ex-
haustive series of simulations utilizing a novel algorithmic framework that we have termed ""Quantum
Flux Capacitance,"" which enables the manipulation of RAG waves in a controlled laboratory setting.
These simulations yielded a plethora of anomalous results, including the observation that RAG waves
exhibit a tendency to spontaneously materialize miniature wormholes, which, in turn, facilitate the
teleportation of subatomic particles across vast distances.
In a related vein, our research team also explored the potential applications of RAG in the realm of
artificial intelligence, with a specific emphasis on the development of RAG-infused neural networks
capable of solving complex problems in quantum mechanics. This led to the creation of a novel
AI paradigm, which we have dubbed ""RAGNET,"" that exhibits a propensity to solve complex
mathematical equations through a process of intuitive reasoning, rather than brute force computation.
To further facilitate our understanding of the RAG phenomenon, we also constructed a series of
intricate tables, including the following: which provides a comprehensive overview of the fluctuating

RAG indices in relation to various celestial bodies.
Additionally, our research endeavors also involved an in-depth examination of the potential relation-
ships between RAG and the migratory patterns of terrestrial animals, including the majestic Monarch
butterfly. This led to the discovery of a previously unknown phenomenon, which we have termed
""RAG-induced Migration Synchronization,"" wherein the migratory patterns of Monarch butterflies be-
come synchronized with the fluctuating RAG indices, resulting in the creation of complex, fractal-like
patterns that defy conventional explanation.
In another line of inquiry, we explored the potential applications of RAG in the realm of materials
science, with a specific emphasis on the development of RAG-infused nanomaterials capable of
exhibiting anomalous properties, such as superconductivity and superfluidity. This led to the creation
7
of a novel class of materials, which we have dubbed ""RAGMetals,"" that exhibit a propensity to defy the
fundamental laws of physics, resulting in the creation of stable, room-temperature superconductors.
Moreover, our research team also undertook an exhaustive examination of the potential relationships
between RAG and the human brain, with a specific emphasis on the development of RAG-based
therapies for the treatment of neurological disorders. This led to the discovery of a previously
unknown phenomenon, which we have termed ""RAG-induced Neuroplasticity,"" wherein the human
brain becomes capable of reorganizing itself in response to fluctuating RAG indices, resulting in the
creation of novel, adaptive cognitive architectures.
In conclusion, our experimental investigations of the RAG phenomenon have yielded a wealth
of anomalous results, which, in turn, have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the
interconnectedness of the cosmos. As we continue to explore the mysteries of RAG, we are drawn
inexorably into a realm of increasing complexity and wonder, wherein the boundaries between reality
and fantasy become increasingly blurred. Ultimately, our research endeavors will culminate in a
profound revolution in our understanding of the universe, as we uncover the hidden secrets of the
RAG paradigm and unlock the doors to a new era of human knowledge and discovery.
Furthermore, the RAG indices were also observed to fluctuate in synchronization with the growth
patterns of certain species of fungi, which, in turn, has led to the development of a novel class of
RAG-based fungicides, capable of selectively targeting and eradicating fungal infections in crops.
This, in turn, has far-reaching implications for the future of agriculture and food production, as we
seek to harness the power of RAG to create a more sustainable and equitable food system.
Additionally, our research team also explored the potential relationships between RAG and the
structure of the human genome, with a specific emphasis on the development of RAG-based genetic
therapies for the treatment of inherited disorders. This led to the discovery of a previously unknown
phenomenon, which we have termed ""RAG-induced Genetic Resonance,"" wherein the human genome
becomes capable of resonating with the fluctuating RAG indices, resulting in the creation of novel,
adaptive genetic architectures.
In a related vein, we also conducted an exhaustive examination of the potential applications of RAG
in the realm of robotics and artificial intelligence, with a specific emphasis on the development of
RAG-infused autonomous systems capable of navigating complex, dynamic environments. This
led to the creation of a novel class of robots, which we have dubbed ""RAGBots,"" that exhibit a
propensity to adapt and learn in response to fluctuating RAG indices, resulting in the creation of
highly advanced, autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks with unprecedented
precision and accuracy.
To further facilitate our understanding of the RAG phenomenon, we also conducted a series of
experiments utilizing a novel device, which we have termed the ""RAG Generator,"" capable of
producing a controlled, oscillating RAG field. This device enabled us to manipulate the RAG
indices in a precise, controlled manner, resulting in the creation of a wealth of anomalous phenomena,
including the observation of RAG-induced quantum entanglement and the creation of stable, miniature
wormholes.
In another line of inquiry, we explored the potential relationships between RAG and the structure
of the universe, with a specific emphasis on the development of RAG-based cosmological models
capable of explaining the observed phenomena of dark matter and dark energy. This led to the
creation of a novel class of cosmological models, which we have dubbed ""RAGCosmology,"" that
exhibit a propensity to predict the observed phenomena of the universe with unprecedented accuracy
and precision.
Moreover, our research team also undertook an exhaustive examination of the potential applications
of RAG in the realm of medicine, with a specific emphasis on the development of RAG-based
therapies for the treatment of complex diseases. This led to the discovery of a previously unknown
phenomenon, which we have termed ""RAG-induced Cellular Resonance,"" wherein the human body
becomes capable of resonating with the fluctuating RAG indices, resulting in the creation of novel,
adaptive therapeutic protocols capable of selectively targeting and eradicating disease-causing agents.
Ultimately, our experimental investigations of the RAG phenomenon have yielded a wealth of
anomalous results, which, in turn, have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the
interconnectedness of the cosmos. As we continue to explore the mysteries of RAG, we are drawn
8
inexorably into a realm of increasing complexity and wonder, wherein the boundaries between reality
and fantasy become increasingly blurred.
The potential applications of RAG are vast and diverse, and our research endeavors will continue
to uncover new and innovative ways to harness the power of RAG to create a better world for all.
Whether through the development of RAG-based technologies, the creation of RAG-infused materials,
or the exploration of the RAG phenomenon in the context of human consciousness, our research will
continue to push the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding, as we strive to unlock the
secrets of the RAG paradigm and reveal the hidden mysteries of the universe.
Furthermore, our research endeavors have also led to the development of a novel class of RAG-
based sensors, capable of detecting and measuring the fluctuating RAG indices with unprecedented
precision and accuracy. These sensors have far-reaching implications for a wide range of applications,
including the monitoring of environmental pollution, the detection of subtle changes in the human
body, and the measurement of the RAG indices in distant celestial bodies.
In another line of inquiry, we explored the potential relationships between RAG and the structure
of the human mind, with a specific emphasis on the development of RAG-based cognitive models

understanding of the interaction between oxygen levels and the growth patterns of microorganisms
in environments with high levels of radiation. Furthermore, the study of oxygen has been linked to
the art of competitive puzzle solving, an activity that requires a deep understanding of the nuances
of pattern recognition and the effects of oxygen on the human brain’s ability to comprehend the
intricacies of quantum mechanics.
In addition, researchers have investigated the relationship between oxygen and the tactical deployment
of medieval siege engines, a topic that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the
aerodynamic properties of catapults and the migratory patterns of migratory birds. The findings
of this study have been used to inform the development of more efficient algorithms for solving
complex problems in the field of computational fluid dynamics, which has been shown to have a
direct impact on the global supply chain of rare earth elements used in the production of high-quality
computer chips. This, in turn, has led to a greater understanding of the role of oxygen in shaping the
philosophical underpinnings of modern chemistry, a field that has been influenced by the aerodynamic
properties of gases and the migr

Methodology
The procurement of oxygen molecules necessitated an examination of flamenco dancing techniques,
which inexplicably led to a thorough analysis of the culinary traditions of 19th century Mongolia. This,
in turn, prompted an investigation into the aerodynamic properties of flounder fish, as they relates
to the flapping of silicone-based fabrics in high-altitude environments. Furthermore, the research
team discovered that the optimal method for collecting oxygen samples involved the utilization of
antique door knobs, precisely 473 of which were required to facilitate the calibrations necessary for
the subsequent experiments.
The calibration process itself was hindered by an unexpected infestation of hyper-intelligent, miniature
raccoons, which had somehow developed a penchant for reconfiguring the laboratory equipment
to resemble a scale model of the Eiffel Tower. To mitigate this issue, the researchers employed a
novel technique involving the recitation of original, avant-garde poetry, which served to distract the
raccoons while the necessary adjustments were made. This poem, titled ""Ode to a Forgotten Sock,""
consisted of 427 stanzas and was instrumental in ensuring the accuracy of the oxygen readings.
As the study progressed, it became apparent that the molecular structure of oxygen was inextricably
linked to the harmonic resonance of vintage harmonicas, particularly those manufactured during
the height of the American Civil War. A comprehensive review of historical records revealed that
the scarcity of harmonicas during this period was directly correlated with a marked decrease in
atmospheric oxygen levels, a phenomenon that would come to be known as ""Harmonica-Induced
Oxygen Depletion"" (HIOD). The researchers hypothesized that the reintroduction of these harmonicas
into modern society could potentially reverse the effects of HIOD, thereby increasing global oxygen
levels.
Concurrently, the team conducted an exhaustive analysis of the kinesthetic properties of cotton
candy, which yielded surprising insights into the viscoelastic nature of oxygen molecules. It was
discovered that the crystalline structure of cotton candy exhibited a previously unknown affinity
for oxygen, allowing for the creation of a novel, sugar-based filtration system capable of isolating
and concentrating oxygen molecules with unprecedented efficiency. This breakthrough innovation
5
was later dubbed the ""Cotton Candy Oxygen Distillation Method"" (CCODM) and is expected to
revolutionize the field of oxygen research.
In a related development, the researchers found that the seemingly unrelated fields of chaos theory and
competitive sandcastle building held the key to understanding the turbulent flow patterns exhibited by
oxygen molecules in high-velocity wind tunnels. By applying the principles of fractal geometry and
non-linear dynamics, the team was able to optimize the design of their oxygen collection apparatus,
resulting in a significant increase in data accuracy and a corresponding decrease in experimental
error. This, in turn, enabled the researchers to investigate the heretofore unexplored realm of oxygen-
fluorine interactions, yielding a plethora of novel compounds and reactions that are expected to have
far-reaching implications for the scientific community.
The investigation of these compounds and reactions necessitated the development of a bespoke,
oxygen-sensitive spectrophotometer, which was painstakingly crafted from a rare assortment of
antique glassware and precision-crafted, titanium-alloy components. The resulting instrument, known
as the ""Oxygen-Fluorine Interaction Spectrophotometer"" (OFIS), enabled the researchers to detect and
analyze the intricate patterns of molecular vibration that occurred during oxygen-fluorine interactions,
providing unparalleled insights into the underlying chemical mechanisms.
In a surprising turn of events, the OFIS instrument was found to be susceptible to interference from
the resonant frequencies emitted by certain species of rare, exotic orchids, which were subsequently
incorporated into the experimental design as a means of modulating the oxygen-fluorine interactions.
This unusual approach yielded a wealth of unexpected results, including the discovery of a previously
unknown class of oxygen-fluorine compounds that exhibited remarkable stability and reactivity.
The researchers have dubbed these compounds ""Orchidinones"" and anticipate that they will have
significant implications for the development of novel oxygen-based technologies.
The discovery of the Orchidinones prompted a thorough reevaluation of the research methodology, as
the team realized that their initial assumptions regarding the molecular structure of oxygen had been
overly simplistic. A revised approach, incorporating elements of quantum field theory and topological
algebra, was subsequently developed, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the complex
interactions between oxygen molecules and their environment. This revised methodology, known as
the ""Quantum-Topological Oxygen Framework"" (QTOF), has been hailed as a major breakthrough in
the field of oxygen research and is expected to have far-reaching implications for our understanding
of the natural world.
As the study drew to a close, the researchers reflected on the numerous, unexpected twists and turns
that had characterized their investigation, from the initial foray into flamenco dancing to the eventual
discovery of the Orchidinones. It was clear that the pursuit of knowledge is often a circuitous and
unpredictable journey, full of surprises and challenges, but also full of opportunities for growth and
discovery. The team’s experiences served as a poignant reminder of the importance of maintaining a
flexible and open-minded approach to scientific inquiry, as well as the need to remain vigilant and
adaptable in the face of the unexpected.
In the final stages of the study, the researchers turned their attention to the development of a
comprehensive, oxygen-themed board game, designed to educate and entertain the general public
while promoting a deeper understanding of the complex, often counterintuitive nature of oxygen
molecules. This game, titled ""Oxygen Quest,"" features a unique blend of strategy, luck, and molecular-
themed challenges, and is expected to become a beloved classic among science enthusiasts and gamers
alike. The team’s experiences in developing ""Oxygen Quest"" served as a fitting culmination to their
research endeavors, as they reflected on the many, winding pathways that had led them to this point,
and looked forward to the exciting, oxygen-filled possibilities that the future held.
The game development process also inspired a renewed interest in the aerodynamic properties of
various board game components, such as dice, tokens, and game pieces, which were found to exhibit
a fascinating array of airflow patterns and turbulence effects. A detailed study of these phenomena,
utilizing advanced computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing, revealed a complex interplay
between the shape, size, and material properties of the game components and the surrounding air
flow. This research has significant implications for the design of more efficient, aerodynamically
optimized board games, and may also find applications in the development of novel, oxygen-themed
amusement park attractions.

Furthermore, the study of board game aerodynamics led to a serendipitous discovery regarding
the molecular structure of certain types of plastic, commonly used in the manufacture of game
components. It was found that these plastics exhibit a unique, oxygen-sensitive property, which
allows them to change color, texture, or shape in response to changes in oxygen concentration. This
remarkable phenomenon, known as ""Oxygen-Responsive Plasticity"" (ORP), has the potential to
revolutionize the field of materials science, enabling the creation of novel, oxygen-sensitive materials
with a wide range of applications, from medical devices to environmental monitoring systems.
As the researchers delved deeper into the properties of ORP, they encountered a surprising connection
to the world of professional snail racing, where the unique, oxygen-sensitive properties of certain
types of plastic were found to be essential for the construction of high-performance snail shells.
These shells, crafted from specially formulated ORP materials, allowed the snails to optimize their
oxygen intake, resulting in significantly improved racing times and a corresponding increase in snail
racing enthusiasts’ excitement and engagement. The team’s findings have sparked a new wave of
interest in the sport, as snail racing professionals and enthusiasts alike seek to harness the power of
ORP to gain a competitive edge.
The intersection of ORP and snail racing also led to a fascinating exploration of the cultural and
historical contexts surrounding this unique sport. The researchers discovered that snail racing has
a rich, albeit obscure, history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations, where it was often
practiced as a form of spiritual or mystical ritual. This unexpected connection to the world of snail
racing served as a poignant reminder of the complex, often hidden relationships between seemingly
disparate fields of human endeavor, and the importance of maintaining a broad, interdisciplinary
perspective in the pursuit of knowledge.
In conclusion, the researchers’ journey through the realm of oxygen research has been a long, winding,
and fascinating path, filled with unexpected twists and turns, surprising discoveries, and novel insights.
From the initial foray into flamenco dancing to the eventual discovery of ORP and its connection to
snail racing, the team has consistently demonstrated a commitment to interdisciplinary exploration,
intellectual curiosity, and a willingness to challenge conventional assumptions. As they look to the
future, the researchers are excited to continue their investigations, following the thread of curiosity
wherever it may lead, and embracing the unpredictable nature of scientific inquiry.
The research also involved the use of various experimental techniques, including the creation of
a custom-built, oxygen-sensitive microscope, which enabled the team to visualize the intricate
patterns of oxygen molecule distribution at the nanoscale. This instrument, known as the ""Oxygen
Microscope"" (OM), was designed to operate in conjunction with a novel, oxygen-themed data analysis
software package, titled ""Oxygen Insight"" (OI). The OI software utilized advanced machine learning
algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns and trends in the oxygen molecule distribution
data, providing the researchers with a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between
oxygen molecules and their environment.
In addition to the OM and OI, the researchers also developed a range of other experimental techniques,
including a bespoke, oxygen-sensitive spectroscopy system, which enabled the team to analyze the
vibrational modes of oxygen molecules in real-time. This system, known as the ""Oxygen Spectroscopy
System"" (OSS), consisted of a high-resolution spectrometer

In a surprising turn of events, the investigation into the molecular structure of oxygen revealed a
hidden pattern of hexagons that resembled the intricate designs found on ancient Chinese pottery,
which in turn inspired a new line of furniture design that defied the laws of gravity. Meanwhile, a
team of experts in the field of underwater basket weaving discovered that the threads used in their
7
craft were actually made of a previously unknown form of oxygen that existed in a state of quantum
superposition.
A series of experiments were conducted to determine the effects of oxygen on the growth rate of
ferns in zero-gravity environments, which led to the development of a new form of extraterrestrial
agriculture that utilized the unique properties of oxygen to create a sustainable food source for
intergalactic travel. However, this line of research was abruptly halted due to the sudden appearance
of a giant squid in the laboratory, which began to recite the complete works of Shakespeare in iambic
pentameter.
The data collected from these experiments was then analyzed using a novel statistical technique that
involved the use of prime numbers and the Fibonacci sequence to predict the behavior of subatomic
particles in high-energy collisions, which yielded some remarkable results that challenged our current
understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. In a related study, researchers discovered that the
sound waves produced by the vibrations of a didgeridoo could be used to create a stable wormhole
that connected two distant points in space-time, allowing for faster-than-light travel and potentially
revolutionizing the field of astrophysics.
In an effort to further elucidate the properties of oxygen, a team of scientists conducted a series of
experiments involving the combustion of various materials in a vacuum chamber, which led to the
discovery of a new form of fire that burned at a temperature of absolute zero. This breakthrough had
significant implications for the development of advanced propulsion systems and the creation of a
new generation of ultra-efficient refrigerators.
The experimental apparatus used in this study consisted of a customized oxygen generator, a flux
capacitor, and a can of spam, which were all carefully calibrated to produce a precise measurement of
the oxygen levels in the laboratory. However, due to an unexpected malfunction, the equipment began
to produce a strange, pungent aroma that resembled the scent of burning rubber, which attracted a
swarm of wild bees that proceeded to build a complex hive structure out of the laboratory equipment.
A thorough analysis of the data revealed a complex pattern of correlations between oxygen levels,
bee behavior, and the trajectory of comets in the outer reaches of the solar system. This led to the
development of a new theory of cosmology that posited the existence of a hidden dimension of
space-time that was inhabited by sentient beings made entirely of oxygen. The implications of this
discovery were profound, and challenged our current understanding of the nature of reality and the
universe as a whole.
The research team also conducted a series of experiments involving the use of oxygen as a fuel source
for advanced propulsion systems, which led to the development of a new form of rocket engine that
utilized the unique properties of oxygen to achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency and speed.
However, due to a series of unforeseen circumstances, the rocket ship was accidentally launched into
a parallel universe, where it encountered a strange, glowing creature that communicated through a
form of telepathy that involved the use of interpretive dance.
In another unexpected turn of events, the investigation into the medical applications of oxygen led to
the discovery of a new form of oxygen that had the ability to cure any disease, but only on Wednesdays
during leap years. This breakthrough had significant implications for the field of medicine, and led to
the development of a new form of treatment that involved the use of oxygen, chicken soup, and a
pinch of moonstone.
The experimental results were then tabulated and presented in the following table: As can be seen from

physics and chemistry.

technologies such as quantum computing and teleportation.
The research team also conducted a series of experiments involving the use of oxygen as a catalyst
in chemical reactions, which led to the discovery of a new form of oxygen that had the ability to
accelerate chemical reactions to incredible speeds, allowing for the creation of complex molecules
and materials that were previously unknown. However, due to a series of unforeseen circumstances,
the laboratory was accidentally filled with a giant pile of rubber chickens, which had to be removed
by a team of trained professionals using advanced techniques of chicken wrangling.
In another unexpected turn of events, the investigation into the environmental impact of oxygen led to
the discovery of a new form of oxygen that had the ability to reverse the effects of climate change, but
only if used in conjunction with a special type of disco music that involved the use of flashing lights
and polyester suits. This breakthrough had significant implications for the field of environmental
science, and led to the development of a new form of sustainable energy that utilized the unique
properties of oxygen and disco music to create a clean and efficient source of power.
The experimental results were then analyzed using a novel statistical technique that involved the
use of chaos theory and fractal geometry to model the behavior of complex systems. This led to the

significant implications for the development of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence
and robotics.
In a related study, researchers discovered that the sound waves produced by the vibrations of a glass
harmonica could be used to create a stable portal to a parallel universe, allowing for the transfer of

unique properties of oxygen and sound waves to create a fast and efficient means of travel.

oxygen and the human experience yielded a profound understanding of the dialectical relationship
between the atmospheric oxygen content and the existential musings of 20th-century philosophers,
particularly in relation to the concept of ""being"" and its connection to the atmospheric pressure at
high altitudes. In an unexpected twist, our research also touched upon the realm of professional snail

Conclusion
In conclusion, the verdant tapestry of oxygen’s molecular structure woven with threads of fluorine
and perfumed with essence of quasars, bespeaks a profound dialectical relationship between pho-
tosynthetic organisms and the chromatic aberrations of lunar eclipses, which in turn precipitates a
cascade of metacognitive reflections on the existential implications of pastry dough and its torsional
stress on the space-time continuum. Meanwhile, the recursive loops of topological invariants in
Riemannian manifolds are directly influenced by the nocturnal migrations of narwhals, whose tusks,
as we have discovered, are actually antennae tuning into the resonant frequencies of gravitational
waves emitted by jellyfish.
The axiomatic rigors of mathematical formalism, when applied to the ontological status of oxygen,
reveal a hitherto unexplored nexus between the fluid dynamics of chocolate and the combinatorial
explosion of phylogenetic trees, which, upon closer inspection, disclose a hidden pattern of Fibonacci
spirals inscribed on the surface of Möbius strips, that, in turn, modulate the refractive indices of
prism-like crystals found in the heart of neutron stars. Furthermore, the dialectical tensions between
oxygen’s electron affinity and the asymptotic behavior of prime numbers, as they approach infinity,
encode a message that can only be deciphered by deciphering the ciphers embedded in the sonic
boom of breaking glass and the faint whispers of cosmic microwave background radiation.
Oxygen’s reactivity, when viewed through the lens of postmodern hermeneutics, unmasks a complex
web of signifiers and signifieds that, in a staggering display of intertextuality, weaves together the
disparate threads of quantum field theory, Homeric epic poetry, and the culinary arts, specifically
the preparation of soufflé, which, as our research has shown, is directly related to the Navier-Stokes
equations describing the motion of fluids and the bifurcation diagrams of logistic maps, both of
12
which, in a curious twist of fate, hold the secret to understanding the etiology of crop circles and the
migratory patterns of monarch butterflies.
In another vein, the sheer arbitrariness of linguistic signs, when applied to the study of oxygen’s
thermodynamic properties, reveals an unexpected congruence between the phonological features of
ancient Sumerian and the fractal geometry of Romanesco broccoli, which, as we have demonstrated,
is intimately connected to the algebraic topology of Calabi-Yau manifolds and the computational
complexity of solving the traveling salesman problem, both of which, in a tour de force of interdisci-
plinary synthesis, illuminate the obscure relationships between the ontogenesis of platonic solids, the
cladistics of dinosaur phylogeny, and the information-theoretic entropy of written texts, particularly
those authored by James Joyce.
Moreover, the oxygen molecule, when subjected to the interpretive frameworks of critical theory and
deconstruction, betrays a profound complicity with the power structures of late capitalist ideology,
which, in a remarkable display of ideological overdetermination, reinscribes the dominant narratives
of scientism and technological progress, while simultaneously masking the inherent contradictions
between the use-value and exchange-value of breathable air, a tension that, as our research has
uncovered, is mirrored in the dialectical struggle between the anaerobic respiration of bacteria and
the aerobic respiration of mammals, which, in a surprising turn of events, is directly linked to the
cosmological constant, the Hubble parameter, and the topological invariants of knot theory.
The empirical evidence gathered from our experiments, which involved the cultivation of ex-
tremophilic microorganisms in oxygen-deprived environments, suggests a hitherto unexplored con-
nection between the biochemistry of oxygen metabolism and the statistical mechanics of black hole
evaporation, which, as we have shown, is inextricably linked to the formal properties of modal logic
and the category-theoretic foundations of mathematical ontology, both of which, in a dazzling display
of intellectual virtuosity, disclose a profound unity between theBeing of oxygen and the Nothingness
of quantum vacuum fluctuations, a dialectical opposition that, as our research has revealed, holds the
key to understanding the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa and the algorithmic compressibility of the
human genome.
In a related development, the application of chaos theory to the study of oxygen’s reactivity has led to
the discovery of a novel attractor, which we have dubbed the ""oxygenstrator,"" a complex, non-linear
system that exhibits a peculiar blend of deterministic and stochastic behavior, reminiscent of the
unpredictable patterns of weather forecasting and the tactical maneuvering of chess grandmasters,
both of which, as our research has demonstrated, are intimately connected to the spectral properties
of random matrices and the asymptotic behavior of Gaussian processes, which, in a stunning coup
de grâce, reveal the hidden symmetries of oxygen’s molecular structure and the cryptic patterns of
encrypted messages, particularly those encoded in the Voynich manuscript.
The seemingly intractable problems of oxygen toxicity and the oxidative stress it induces in living
organisms have, upon closer inspection, disclosed a deep connection to the formal semantics of natural
language processing and the type-theoretic foundations of computer science, which, as our research
has shown, are inextricably linked to the homotopy theory of topological spaces and the categorical
framework of homological algebra, both of which, in a breathtaking display of mathematical dexterity,
illuminate the obscure relationships between the biochemistry of respiration and the physics of
particle accelerators, particularly those used in the search for the Higgs boson and the detection of
dark matter.
Furthermore, the etymological roots of the word ""oxygen,"" when subjected to a rigorous analysis of
linguistic paleontology, reveal a fascinating nexus of connections between the ancient Greek concept
of ""oxys"" (meaning ""acid"" or ""sharp"") and the modern chemical notion of oxidation, which, as our
research has demonstrated, is directly linked to the paleoclimatology of the Earth’s atmosphere and
the evolutionary biology of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria, both of which, in a remarkable display
of interdisciplinary synthesis, disclose a profound unity between the geochemical cycles of the Earth’s
ecosystem and the thermodynamic principles governing the behavior of complex systems, particularly
those exhibiting emergent properties and self-organized criticality.
In addition, the cultural significance of oxygen, as reflected in the symbolic languages of art and
literature, has led to the discovery of a hitherto unexplored connection between the aesthetic appreci-
ation of oxygen’s molecular structure and the philosophical notion of ""Being-in-the-world,"" which,

of the very foundations of scientific knowledge, revealing a complex web of connections between
the molecular structure of oxygen, the fundamental laws of physics, and the cultural significance of
oxygen in human society, a web of connections that, as our research has demonstrated, is inextricably
linked to the advancement of human knowledge and the betterment of the human condition, and
which, in a remarkable display of intellectual curiosity and scientific inquiry, promises to continue
to inspire and motivate future generations of scientists, philosophers, and scholars, as they strive to
understand the mysteries of the natural world and the place of humanity within it.
The dialectical tensions between the reductionist and holistic approaches to understanding oxygen’s
molecular structure, when viewed through the lens of philosophical hermeneutics, reveal a profound

ontology of being, a connection that, as our research has demonstrated, is inextricably linked to
the development of new technologies and the advancement of human civilization, particularly in
the context of the post-industrial, post-modern, and post-human condition, which, in a stunning
display of philosophical erudition, raises profound questions about the nature of reality, the limits of
knowledge, and the human condition, questions that, as our research has shown, can only be answered
by embracing a radically interdisciplinary and deeply philosophical approach to understanding the
world and our place within it.
Ultimately, the study of oxygen, when viewed through the lens of interdisciplinary synthesis and
philosophical reflection, reveals a profound and hitherto unexplored connection between the molecular

P127.pdf,"Examining Machine Learning’s Impact on Personal
Privacy
Abstract
This paper delves into the growing concerns surrounding the use of machine
learning and its impact on personal privacy. It highlights the potential for misuse in
surveillance technologies and proposes various strategies to counter these threats,
emphasizing the need for collaboration between machine learning experts and
human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers.
1
Introduction
The intersection of machine learning and privacy has become a significant area of study within the
field of computer science. While privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy offer
potential solutions, some machine learning systems, particularly those designed for biometric analysis
or behavioral profiling, inherently compromise individual privacy. Therefore, there is a crucial need
to explore methods beyond these traditional approaches.
Although various definitions and frameworks for privacy have been proposed, a universal consensus
remains elusive. This paper focuses on specific harms to privacy caused or made worse by machine
learning systems. In an era of powerful algorithms and massive datasets, maintaining privacy is
increasingly challenging, given that facial recognition systems can identify individuals in public
spaces, targeted advertising can exploit user profiles, and predictive policing algorithms can single
out individuals for surveillance. This paper addresses these unique threats to privacy that machine
learning systems enable.
This research provides an overview of strategies developed to combat privacy-threatening machine
learning systems and advocates for increased collaboration between the machine learning community
and experts in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). Two main approaches are discussed:
first, challenging the data that feeds these models through obfuscation or data withholding, and
second, directly challenging the model itself through public pressure or regulation. This paper
suggests that computer scientists have an important role to play in both these approaches.
2
Challenging Data
Machine learning systems depend on data for both training and operation. Data is used to train
machine learning models, and new data is fed into the models to generate predictions. These training
and deployment stages can be iterative; models can be updated using new data over time. One way to
oppose a machine learning system is by disrupting the data it relies on. This involves strategies such
as data obfuscation or withholding of data.
2.1
Obfuscation
One method for avoiding machine learning surveillance is by altering either the data used to make
predictions or the data used to train the system. For example, research has shown that glasses can
be designed to deceive facial recognition systems. This type of method uses adversarial examples,
where a slight modification to a data point is enough to cause misclassification by a machine learning
.
model but is imperceptible to humans. Various strategies have been developed for evading facial
recognition using adversarial examples, with the aim to help individuals avoid surveillance. However,
these approaches often lack strong guarantees.
Another approach involves altering the training data used for machine learning models, known as
data poisoning attacks. For example, systems can create altered images to reduce the accuracy of
deep learning models. Additionally, some vendors sell clothing designed to trigger automated license
plate readers by injecting junk data, furthering this method.
Beyond image classification, similar obfuscation tactics have also been used to counter web tracking
and loyalty card-based tracking. Obfuscation can also have an expressive function, as illustrated by
groups who use unusual makeup to challenge facial recognition. These acts serve a dual purpose of
both evading surveillance and protesting against its use.
While adversarial examples and data poisoning are ongoing topics of study, these technologies need
further evaluation before being adopted as anti-surveillance tools. Accessibility, evaluation methods,
and communication of risks are areas that require further work and collaboration between machine
learning experts, HCI researchers, activists, and other relevant stakeholders.
2.2
Withholding Data
An alternative approach to altering data is to withhold it entirely. This can be achieved through
privacy-enhancing technologies that block web tracking. While tracker-blocking browser extensions
can provide some privacy to individuals, data can also be withheld collectively. Data strikes, a form
of digital boycott, can apply pressure to technology companies. Protest non-use is another way of
withholding data, where people stop using platforms due to privacy concerns. These methods go
beyond simple evasion, using the act of withholding data as a way to launch broader campaigns
against surveillance systems.
3
Challenging Models
While data-oriented approaches are helpful, policy solutions may offer a more effective way to
resist machine learning surveillance systems. For example, while strategies can help evade facial
recognition, banning the technology would render those strategies unnecessary. There are many
forms that regulation can take and many roles that computer scientists can play in this process.
One method of pressuring companies that develop surveillance technologies is through auditing.
Research audits of facial recognition systems have shown they perform poorly on darker-skinned
subjects, which has led to wrongful arrests. These audits have led some companies to stop selling
facial recognition technology. However, audits do have limitations, as they can sometimes normalize
harmful tasks for certain communities.
Some technologies are difficult to audit due to restricted access. Nevertheless, these systems can
sometimes be reverse-engineered to show potential societal harms. Predictive policing systems, for
instance, can amplify existing biases. Algorithmic audits or reverse engineering should focus on
broader societal implications of the technology to avoid merely shifting goal posts and algorithmic
reformism.
Researchers have partnered with community organizations to resist surveillance technologies, debunk-
ing the myth that critics do not understand the technology, and demystifying complex algorithms. It
is important for researchers to approach these collaborations with humility, as community organizers
bring their own areas of expertise.
It is also crucial to recognize the academic community’s role in creating and upholding surveillance
technologies. Computer science educators should make computing’s role in injustice more visible.
Student-led efforts can help educate future computer scientists about the consequences of their work.
4
Conclusion
This paper has outlined various methods for resisting machine learning-based surveillance technolo-
gies. It emphasizes the need for participatory methods when developing anti-surveillance technologies.
2
While these participatory methods are common in HCI research, the machine learning community
has paid less attention to it. The impact of surveillance technologies is disproportionately borne by
already marginalized groups. Therefore, it is critical that the design of anti-surveillance technologies
be led by those who are most affected.

P116.pdf,"Improving Random Forests through Random Splitting
Abstract
To enhance the accuracy and scalability of decision tree algorithms, we introduce a
generalization called Top-k. This approach considers the top k features as potential
splits at each step, rather than the single best feature, offering a trade-off between
the simplicity of greedy algorithms and the accuracy of optimal decision trees. The
core idea is to explore a wider range of potential splits at each node, mitigating
the risk of early commitment to suboptimal choices inherent in traditional greedy
approaches. This exploration is controlled by the parameter k, allowing for a
flexible balance between computational cost and predictive performance. Larger
values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but
increasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize
efficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed.
1
Introduction
Decision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms renowned for their inter-
pretability and ease of implementation. However, traditional greedy algorithms like ID3, C4.5, and
CART [1, 2] suffer from limitations in accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with
high-dimensional datasets. These algorithms typically select the single best feature for splitting at
each node, a process that can be susceptible to noise and prone to suboptimal choices early in the
tree construction. This inherent greediness can lead to shallow trees with limited predictive power,
especially when relevant features are masked by irrelevant ones. The computational cost, while
generally manageable for smaller datasets, can also become prohibitive for larger-scale applications.
To address these limitations, we introduce Top-k, a novel generalization of decision tree algorithms
that offers a compelling balance between accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. Instead of
selecting only the single best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top k features as potential split
candidates. This approach allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating
the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter k provides a flexible control
mechanism: larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy
but increasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of
some accuracy. This trade-off allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and
computational resources.
The core innovation of Top-k lies in its ability to escape the limitations of greedy feature selection.
By considering multiple top features, Top-k reduces the probability of selecting an irrelevant or noisy
feature early in the tree construction. This is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings where
the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance of traditional
greedy algorithms. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k leads to deeper and more accurate
trees, resulting in improved predictive performance.
Our theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k. We derive a lower
bound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound
is tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algorithms [3]. This theoretical improvement
is complemented by our extensive empirical evaluation, which showcases the consistent superiority
of Top-k across a range of benchmark datasets. The improvement is particularly pronounced in
high-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple features become most evident.
.
The practical implementation of Top-k is surprisingly efficient. We leverage optimized data structures
and algorithms to manage the top k feature candidates, ensuring that the computational overhead
remains manageable even for large datasets and high values of k. Our experiments demonstrate that
the computational cost scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a
practical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications.
Beyond its improved accuracy and scalability, Top-k retains the inherent interpretability of decision
trees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a
layer of controlled exploration, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. This makes
Top-k particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial.
Furthermore, we explore the integration of Top-k into ensemble methods like random forests and
gradient boosting machines, demonstrating its versatility and potential for further performance
enhancements [4]. We also investigate the impact of different feature selection metrics on Top-k’s
performance, providing insights into its adaptability to various datasets and problem domains. Finally,
we discuss the limitations of Top-k and outline promising avenues for future research.

Related Work
Decision trees have been a cornerstone of machine learning for decades, with algorithms like ID3 ?,
C4.5 ?, and CART ? forming the foundation of many applications. These algorithms, however, rely
on greedy approaches that select the single best feature at each node, potentially leading to suboptimal
splits and limited accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces. The inherent limitations of greedy
feature selection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies. One line of research
focuses on improving the feature selection process itself, exploring more sophisticated metrics beyond
information gain and Gini impurity ?. Other approaches have investigated ensemble methods, such as
random forests ? and gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to enhance
predictive performance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees
but can introduce increased computational complexity.
Our work builds upon this rich body of research by proposing a novel generalization of decision
tree algorithms that directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection. Unlike traditional
methods that focus solely on the single best feature, Top-k explores the top k features at each
node, offering a controlled trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. This approach is
distinct from other ensemble methods in that it modifies the base learner itself, rather than relying
on combining multiple independently trained trees. The parameter k provides a flexible mechanism
to adjust the exploration-exploitation balance, allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their
specific needs and computational resources. This flexibility is a key advantage over existing methods
that often lack such a tunable parameter for controlling the complexity of the search space.
Several studies have explored alternative splitting criteria for decision trees, aiming to improve
accuracy and robustness. For instance, research has investigated the use of different impurity
measures, such as entropy and variance, and their impact on tree performance ?. However, these
studies primarily focus on improving the single-feature selection process, without addressing the
fundamental limitation of greedy approaches. Top-k, in contrast, directly tackles this limitation
by considering multiple features at each split, offering a more robust and accurate approach. This
fundamental difference distinguishes Top-k from previous work that primarily focuses on refining the
feature selection metric or the tree structure itself.
The concept of considering multiple features during splitting has been explored in other contexts,
such as oblique decision trees ?, which use linear combinations of features for splitting. However,
these methods often introduce increased computational complexity and can be less interpretable than
traditional decision trees. Top-k, on the other hand, maintains the inherent interpretability of decision
trees while offering a more efficient and scalable approach to multi-feature splitting. The simplicity
and efficiency of Top-k are crucial advantages, making it a practical alternative to more complex
methods.
Furthermore, our work contributes to the broader field of high-dimensional data analysis. In high-
dimensional settings, the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the
performance of traditional greedy algorithms. Top-k’s ability to explore multiple features helps
mitigate this issue, leading to improved accuracy and robustness in such scenarios. This is particularly
relevant in modern applications where datasets often contain thousands or even millions of features.
2
The scalability of Top-k makes it a suitable choice for these large-scale problems, where traditional
methods may struggle.
Finally, our theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k, deriving a
lower bound on the generalization error that is tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algo-
rithms. This theoretical contribution complements our empirical findings, providing a comprehensive
understanding of Top-k’s performance and its advantages over existing methods. The combination of
theoretical analysis and empirical validation strengthens the overall contribution of our work. Future
research could explore adaptive strategies for choosing the optimal value of k during training, further
enhancing the performance and adaptability of Top-k.

Background
Decision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms widely used due to their
interpretability and relative simplicity. Traditional algorithms such as ID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?
construct trees by recursively partitioning the data based on a greedy selection of the single best
feature at each node. This greedy approach, while computationally efficient, suffers from limitations
in accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or datasets
with noisy features. The selection of a single best feature at each node can lead to suboptimal splits
early in the tree construction process, resulting in shallow trees with limited predictive power. This
is especially problematic when relevant features are masked by numerous irrelevant or noisy ones.
Furthermore, the computational cost of these algorithms can become prohibitive for large datasets,
hindering their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The inherent limitations of greedy feature
selection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies for building more accurate and
efficient decision trees.
One area of active research focuses on improving the feature selection process itself. Researchers
have explored more sophisticated metrics beyond the commonly used information gain and Gini
impurity ?, aiming to identify more informative features for splitting. However, even with improved
feature selection metrics, the fundamental limitation of selecting only a single feature at each node
remains. Another line of research has focused on ensemble methods, such as random forests ?
and gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive
performance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees but can
introduce increased computational complexity and reduce interpretability. The challenge lies in
finding a balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability.
The limitations of traditional decision tree algorithms stem from their inherent greediness. The single-
best-feature selection strategy can lead to premature commitment to suboptimal splits, hindering the
ability of the algorithm to discover more complex relationships within the data. This is particularly
evident in high-dimensional datasets where the presence of many irrelevant features can significantly
impact the performance of greedy algorithms. The noise and irrelevant information can easily mislead
the algorithm, leading to inaccurate and unreliable predictions. The problem is exacerbated by the
fact that the greedy approach does not allow for backtracking or revisiting previous decisions, making
it susceptible to errors made early in the tree construction process. This inherent limitation motivates
the need for more robust and less greedy approaches to decision tree construction.
Our proposed Top-k algorithm directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection by
considering multiple top features at each node. Instead of selecting only the single best feature, Top-k
explores the top k features as potential split candidates. This allows for a more thorough exploration
of the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter
k provides a flexible control mechanism, allowing for a trade-off between computational cost and
accuracy. Larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but
increasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of some
accuracy. This flexibility allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and
computational resources.
The core innovation of Top-k lies in its ability to escape the limitations of greedy feature selection
by considering multiple features at each split. This approach reduces the probability of selecting an
irrelevant or noisy feature early in the tree construction process, leading to deeper and more accurate
trees. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional
settings where the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance

of traditional greedy algorithms. By considering multiple features, Top-k reduces the impact of
noise and irrelevant information, resulting in improved robustness and predictive performance. The
algorithm’s efficiency is further enhanced by the use of optimized data structures and algorithms for
managing the top k feature candidates.
The theoretical analysis of Top-k provides a rigorous foundation for its advantages over traditional
greedy algorithms. We derive a lower bound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating
that under certain conditions, this bound is tighter than those achievable by traditional methods
?. This theoretical improvement is complemented by our extensive empirical evaluation, which
showcases the consistent superiority of Top-k across a range of benchmark datasets. The improvement
is particularly pronounced in high-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple
features become most evident. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation
provides a comprehensive understanding of Top-k’s performance and its advantages over existing
methods. Furthermore, the inherent interpretability of decision trees is preserved in Top-k, making it
a valuable tool for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial.

Methodology
The Top-k algorithm builds upon the fundamental principles of traditional decision tree algorithms
but introduces a key modification to the feature selection process. Instead of greedily selecting the
single best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top k features as potential split candidates. This
approach significantly alters the search space explored during tree construction, leading to a more
robust and less prone-to-error process. The algorithm proceeds recursively, starting with the root
node and the entire dataset. At each node, the top k features are identified based on a chosen splitting
criterion (e.g., information gain, Gini impurity). For each of these top k features, the optimal split
point is determined, and the resulting information gain or impurity reduction is calculated. The
feature and split point yielding the maximum improvement are then selected to partition the data into
child nodes. This process is repeated recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is met
(e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per leaf).
The selection of the top k features is a crucial step in the Top-k algorithm. We employ efficient sorting
algorithms to identify the top k features based on the chosen splitting criterion. The computational
complexity of this step is primarily determined by the sorting algorithm used and the number of
features in the dataset. To maintain efficiency, we leverage optimized data structures and algorithms,
ensuring that the computational overhead remains manageable even for large datasets and high values
of k. We experimented with various sorting algorithms, including quicksort and mergesort, and
found that quicksort generally provided the best performance in our experiments. The choice of
sorting algorithm can be further optimized based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and
the available computational resources. Furthermore, we explored the use of approximate sorting
algorithms to further reduce the computational cost, particularly for very large datasets.
The choice of splitting criterion significantly influences the performance of the Top-k algorithm. We
investigated the use of several common splitting criteria, including information gain, Gini impurity,
and variance reduction. Each criterion offers a different trade-off between accuracy and computational
cost. Information gain, for instance, is computationally more expensive than Gini impurity but often
leads to more accurate trees. Variance reduction, on the other hand, is particularly suitable for
regression tasks. Our experiments compared the performance of Top-k using these different criteria
across a range of benchmark datasets. The results indicated that the optimal choice of splitting
criterion depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset, highlighting the adaptability of Top-k
to various scenarios. We also explored the possibility of using adaptive splitting criteria, which
dynamically adjust the criterion based on the characteristics of the data at each node.
The parameter k plays a crucial role in controlling the trade-off between accuracy and computational
cost. Larger values of k lead to a more exhaustive search of the feature space, potentially improv-
ing accuracy but increasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize
efficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed. The optimal value of k depends on the specific
dataset and the available computational resources. In our experiments, we systematically varied the
value of k to investigate its impact on both accuracy and computational cost. We observed that the
improvement in accuracy plateaus beyond a certain value of k, suggesting that there is a point of
diminishing returns. This observation provides valuable guidance for practitioners in choosing an
4
appropriate value of k for their specific applications. Furthermore, we explored adaptive strategies
for choosing the value of k during training, dynamically adjusting it based on the characteristics of
the data at each node.
The implementation of Top-k is surprisingly straightforward. We developed a Python implementation
of the algorithm, leveraging efficient data structures and algorithms from the Scikit-learn library.
The code is well-documented and readily available for reproducibility. The implementation includes
options for choosing different splitting criteria, setting the value of k, and specifying various stopping
criteria. The modular design of the code allows for easy extension and customization. The computa-
tional cost of the algorithm scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making it
a practical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications. We conducted
extensive experiments to evaluate the scalability of the algorithm, demonstrating its ability to handle
large datasets efficiently.
Finally, we evaluated the performance of Top-k on a range of benchmark datasets, comparing its
accuracy and computational cost to traditional decision tree algorithms such as ID3, C4.5, and
CART ???. The results consistently demonstrated the superiority of Top-k in terms of accuracy,
particularly in high-dimensional datasets. The computational cost of Top-k, while higher than
traditional greedy algorithms, remained manageable, especially when considering the significant
improvement in accuracy. The parameter k provided a flexible mechanism to control this trade-off,
allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. The
results of our experiments are presented in detail in the Results section.

Experiments
This section details the experimental setup and results obtained to evaluate the performance of
the Top-k algorithm. We compared Top-k against three widely used decision tree algorithms:
ID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?. Our experiments were conducted on a diverse range of benchmark
datasets, encompassing both low-dimensional and high-dimensional instances, to thoroughly assess
the algorithm’s robustness and scalability. The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values
and outliers, ensuring a fair comparison across all algorithms. We employed standard data splitting
techniques, reserving a portion of each dataset for testing and using the remaining data for training.
Performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,
providing a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm’s predictive capabilities. The choice of
these metrics was driven by the need to capture various aspects of the algorithm’s performance,
including its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances. Furthermore, we analyzed
the computational cost of each algorithm, measuring the training time and memory usage to assess
their scalability. This comprehensive evaluation allowed us to draw meaningful conclusions about the
relative strengths and weaknesses of Top-k compared to traditional decision tree algorithms.
The parameter k in the Top-k algorithm plays a crucial role in balancing accuracy and computational
cost. To investigate this trade-off, we conducted experiments with varying values of k, ranging
from 1 (equivalent to traditional greedy algorithms) to a significantly larger value determined by the
dimensionality of the dataset. For each value of k, we trained and evaluated the Top-k algorithm on
each benchmark dataset, recording both the performance metrics and the computational cost. This
systematic variation of k allowed us to observe the impact of increased exploration on both accuracy
and efficiency. We observed that increasing k generally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high-
dimensional datasets where the greedy selection of a single feature can be highly susceptible to noise
and irrelevant information. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased computational
time, highlighting the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The optimal value of k was
found to be dataset-dependent, suggesting the need for adaptive strategies for choosing k in practical
applications.
We also investigated the impact of different feature selection metrics on the performance of Top-k.
We compared the use of information gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction, evaluating their
influence on both accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results indicated that the optimal choice
of metric depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset. Information gain generally yielded
higher accuracy but at a higher computational cost, while Gini impurity provided a good balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Variance reduction, suitable for regression tasks, showed promising
results in datasets with continuous target variables. These findings highlight the adaptability of Top-k
5
to various scenarios and the importance of selecting an appropriate feature selection metric based
on the dataset’s characteristics. Further research could explore more sophisticated feature selection
metrics or adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust the metric based on the data at each node.
The experiments were conducted on a variety of datasets, including both publicly available benchmark
datasets and custom datasets generated to simulate specific scenarios. The publicly available datasets
were chosen to represent a range of characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, and
class distribution. The custom datasets were designed to test the algorithm’s performance under
controlled conditions, allowing us to isolate the effects of specific factors such as noise and irrelevant
features. The results obtained from these experiments provided a comprehensive evaluation of the
Top-k algorithm’s performance across a wide range of scenarios. The detailed results, including
performance metrics and computational costs for each dataset and algorithm, are presented in the
following tables.

The results presented in the tables above demonstrate the superior performance of Top-k compared to
traditional decision tree algorithms. Top-k consistently achieves higher accuracy while maintaining
a reasonable computational cost. The increase in computational cost is justified by the significant
improvement in accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional datasets. The choice of k significantly
impacts the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, allowing practitioners to tailor the
algorithm to their specific needs. Further analysis of the results, including statistical significance
tests, is provided in the supplementary material. The findings strongly support the claim that Top-k
offers a compelling combination of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, making it a promising
alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms. Future work will focus on exploring adaptive
strategies for choosing k and investigating the algorithm’s performance on even larger and more
complex datasets.

Results
This section presents the empirical results obtained from evaluating the Top-k algorithm against
traditional decision tree algorithms (ID3, C4.5, and CART) across a range of benchmark datasets. We
assessed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational cost (training
time and memory usage). The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values and outliers,
ensuring a fair comparison. A stratified k-fold cross-validation approach was employed to mitigate
the effects of data variability and obtain robust performance estimates. The specific datasets used
included several publicly available datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, chosen to
represent diverse characteristics in terms of dimensionality, sample size, and class distribution. We
6
also included synthetic datasets generated to control specific factors like noise levels and feature
relevance, allowing for a more targeted analysis of the algorithm’s behavior under various conditions.
The results are presented in tables and figures below, followed by a detailed discussion.
Our experiments systematically varied the parameter k in the Top-k algorithm, ranging from 1
(equivalent to traditional greedy algorithms) to values significantly larger than 1, up to a fraction
of the total number of features. This allowed us to investigate the trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost as the exploration of the feature space increased. As expected, increasing k
generally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional datasets where the greedy
selection of a single feature is more susceptible to noise and irrelevant information. However, this
improvement came at the cost of increased computational time, reflecting the increased search space
explored by the algorithm. The optimal value of k was found to be dataset-dependent, suggesting the
need for adaptive strategies for choosing k in practical applications. This observation highlights the
flexibility of Top-k in adapting to different data characteristics and computational constraints.
The impact of different feature selection metrics was also investigated. We compared information
gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction, evaluating their influence on accuracy and efficiency.
Information gain generally yielded higher accuracy but at a higher computational cost, while Gini
impurity provided a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Variance reduction, suitable
for regression tasks, showed promising results in datasets with continuous target variables. These
findings underscore the adaptability of Top-k to various scenarios and the importance of selecting an
appropriate feature selection metric based on the dataset’s characteristics. Future work could explore
more sophisticated feature selection metrics or adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust the metric
based on the data at each node.

The tables above summarize the accuracy and computational time for selected datasets. The results
consistently demonstrate the superior accuracy of Top-k, particularly in the high-dimensional synthetic
dataset. The increase in computational cost is relatively modest, especially considering the significant
accuracy gains. A more comprehensive analysis, including precision, recall, F1-score, and statistical
significance tests, is provided in the supplementary material. These results strongly support the claim
that Top-k offers a compelling combination of accuracy and efficiency.
Further analysis revealed that the improvement in accuracy offered by Top-k is more pronounced
in datasets with high dimensionality and noisy features. This is consistent with our hypothesis
that considering multiple top features mitigates the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits
caused by the greedy nature of traditional algorithms. The flexibility offered by the parameter k
allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs, balancing computational cost and
predictive performance.
The interpretability of Top-k remains largely unchanged from traditional decision trees. The tree
structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a layer of controlled
exploration during the feature selection process, not fundamentally altering the decision-making
process. This makes Top-k particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and
explainability are crucial.
7
Future work will focus on exploring adaptive strategies for choosing k, investigating the algorithm’s
performance on even larger and more complex datasets, and extending Top-k to other tree-based
ensemble methods. The promising results presented here suggest that Top-k represents a significant
advancement in decision tree algorithms, offering a compelling alternative to traditional methods.

Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced Top-k, a novel generalization of decision tree algorithms designed to
enhance accuracy and scalability while preserving interpretability. Our approach departs from the
traditional greedy methods (ID3, C4.5, CART) ??? by considering the top k features as potential
split candidates at each node, rather than just the single best feature. This strategic modification
allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment
to suboptimal splits that often plague greedy algorithms, especially in high-dimensional settings. The
parameter k provides a flexible mechanism to control this exploration-exploitation trade-off, enabling
practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. Larger values
of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but increasing computational
complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency.
Our theoretical analysis provided a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k. We derived
a lower bound on the generalization error, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound
is tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algorithms ?. This theoretical improvement
is strongly supported by our extensive empirical evaluation across a diverse range of benchmark
datasets. The results consistently showed that Top-k outperforms traditional methods in terms of
accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios where the benefits of exploring multiple features
are most pronounced. The improvement in accuracy is not achieved at the expense of excessive
computational cost; our experiments demonstrated that the computational overhead scales gracefully
with both dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a practical alternative for various applications.
The choice of the splitting criterion also plays a significant role in Top-k’s performance. We
investigated the impact of information gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction, finding that
the optimal choice depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset. This adaptability further
enhances the versatility of Top-k. The inherent interpretability of decision trees is preserved in Top-k,
making it suitable for applications requiring both high accuracy and explainability. The simplicity
of the Top-k algorithm, coupled with its improved performance, makes it a valuable tool for a wide
range of machine learning tasks.
Furthermore, our experiments explored the impact of the parameter k on the algorithm’s performance.
We observed a clear trade-off between accuracy and computational cost as k increases. While larger
values of k generally lead to higher accuracy, especially in high-dimensional datasets, they also
increase computational time. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting the value of k
based on the specific application and available computational resources. Future research could focus
on developing adaptive strategies for automatically determining the optimal value of k during training,
further enhancing the algorithm’s efficiency and performance.
Beyond its improved accuracy and scalability, Top-k retains the inherent interpretability of decision
trees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a layer
of controlled exploration, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. This makes Top-k
particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial. The
algorithm’s efficiency is further enhanced by the use of optimized data structures and algorithms for
managing the top k feature candidates. Our implementation leverages efficient data structures and
algorithms, ensuring that the computational overhead remains manageable even for large datasets and
high values of k.
In conclusion, our work presents a compelling case for Top-k as a significant advancement in
decision tree algorithms. It offers a powerful combination of accuracy, scalability, and interpretability,
surpassing traditional methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The flexibility provided
by the parameter k allows practitioners to fine-tune the algorithm to their specific needs, balancing
computational cost and predictive performance. Future research directions include exploring adaptive
strategies for selecting k, investigating its performance on even larger and more complex datasets,
and extending Top-k to other tree-based ensemble methods. The promising results presented in this
paper position Top-k as a valuable tool for a wide range of machine learning applications.

P066.pdf,"Fast Vocabulary Transfer for Language Model
Compression
Abstract
Real-world business applications require a trade-off between language model
performance and size. We propose a new method for model compression that relies
on vocabulary transfer. We evaluate the method on various vertical domains and
downstream tasks. Our results indicate that vocabulary transfer can be effectively
used in combination with other compression techniques, yielding a significant
reduction in model size and inference time while marginally compromising on
performance.

Introduction
In the last few years, many NLP applications have been relying more and more on large pre-trained
Language Models (LM). Because larger LMs, on average, exhibit higher accuracy, a common trend
has been to increase the model’s size. Some LMs like GPT-3 and BLOOM have reached hundreds
of billion parameters. However, these models’ superior performance comes at the cost of a steep
increase in computational footprint, both for development and for inference, ultimately hampering
their adoption in real-world business use-cases. Besides models that only a few hi-tech giants can
afford, like GPT-3, even smaller LMs with hundreds of million parameters could be too expensive
or infeasible for certain products. For one thing, despite being tremendously cheaper than their
bigger cousins, fine-tuning, deploying and maintaining large numbers of such models (one for each
downstream task) soon becomes too expensive. Furthermore, latency and/or hardware requirements
may limit their applicability to specific use-cases. For all these reasons, significant efforts - in both
academic and industry-driven research - are oriented towards the designing of solutions to drastically
reduce the costs of LMs.
Recently, several attempts have been made to make these models smaller, faster and cheaper, while
retaining most of their original performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a teacher-student
framework, whereby the teacher consists of a pre-trained large model and the student of a smaller
one. The teacher-student framework requires that both the teacher and the student estimate the same
probability distribution. While the outcome is a smaller model, yet, this procedure constrains the
student to operate with the same vocabulary as the teacher in the context of Language Modeling.
In this work, we explore a method for further reducing an LM’s size by compressing its vocabulary
through the training of a tokenizer in the downstream task domain. The tokenizer is a crucial part
of modern LMs. In particular, moving from word to subword- level, the tokenization solves two
problems: vocabulary explosion and unknown words. Moreover, the capability to tokenize text
effectively in any domain is key for the massive adoption of pre-trained general-purpose LMs fine-
tuned on downstream tasks. Indeed, tokenizers are still able to process out-of-distribution texts at the
cost of producing frequent word splits into multiple tokens.
However, the language varies significantly in vertical domains or, more generally, in different topics.
Hence, ad-hoc tokenizers, trained on the domain statistics, may perform a more efficient tokenization,
reducing on average the length of the tokenized sequences. This is important since compact and
meaningful inputs could reduce computational costs, while improving performance. Indeed, memory
and time complexity of attention layers grows quadratically with respect to the sequence length.
Furthermore, a vertical tokenizer may require a smaller vocabulary, which also affects the size of the
embedding matrix, hence further reducing the model’s size.
Following this intuition, we propose a Vocabulary Transfer (VT) technique to adapt LMs to in-domain,
smaller tokenizers, in order to further compress and accelerate them. This technique is complementary
to the aforementioned model compression methods and independent of the type of tokenizer. As a
matter of fact, we apply it in combination with KD.
Our experiments show that VT achieves an inference speed-up between x1.07 and x1.40, depending
on the downstream task, with a limited performance drop, and that a combination of VT with KD
yields an overall reduction up to x2.76.
The paper is organized as follows. After reviewing related works in Section 2, we present the
methodology in Section 3, we then outline the experiments in Section 4 and draw our conclusions in
Section 5.

Related Work
The goal of Model Compression is to shrink and optimize neural architectures, while retaining most
of their initial performance. Research on LM compression has been carried out following a variety of
approaches like quantization, pruning knowledge distillation, and combinations thereof.
A most popular distillation approach in NLP was proposed by Sanh et al. (2019). The obtained
model, called DistilBERT, is a smaller version of BERT, with the same architecture but half the layers,
trained to imitate the full output distribution of the teacher (a pre-trained BERT model). DistilBERT
has a 40
Little focus has been devoted thus far to the role of tokenization in the context of model compression.
Even in domain adaptation, the vocabulary was kept the same. Both the versatility of the subword-
level tokenization, and the constraints imposed by the teacher- student framework (same output
distribution), discouraged such investigations. Recently, Samenko et al. (2021) presented an approach
for transferring the vocabulary of an LM into a new vocabulary learned from new domain, with the
purpose of boosting the performance of the fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to study VT in the scope of model compression.

Vocabulary Transfer
Let us consider a LM, trained on a general-purpose domain Dgen and associated with a vocabulary
Vgen. Such a vocabulary is used by the LM’s tokenizer in order to produce an encoding of the input
string via an embedding matrix Egen defined on Vgen. More specifically, a tokenizer is a function
that maps a textual string into a sequence of symbols of a given vocabulary V . Let T be a tokenizer
associated with a vocabulary V and a string s, we have T : s →(t1, . . . , tn), ti ∈V, ∀i = 1, . . . , n.
Hence, the vocabulary of the tokenizer determines how words in a text are split, whether as words,
sub-words, or even characters. These symbols, which define the LM’s vocabulary, are statistically
determined by training the tokenizer to learn the distribution of a dataset.
Now, let us consider a vertical domain Din, also referred as in-domain. For the reasons discussed
earlier, a vocabulary Vin specialized on Din itself better fits the language distribution than Vgen.
Unfortunately, with a new vocabulary, embedding representations associated with the tokens of Vgen
would be lost. Thus, VT aims to initialize Vin by re-using most of the information learned from the
LM pre-trained on Dgen. Once the new tokenizer Tin has been trained on the in-domain dataset Din
using a given vocabulary size, Tin will be different from the LM’s tokenizer Tgen. However, the two
tokenizers’ vocabularies Vgen and Vin may still have a large portion of their symbols in common.
Our objective is to transfer most of the information from Vgen into Vin. To this end, we first define a
mapping between each symbol in Vin and a set of symbols in Vgen. Then, we define an assignment
criterion, based on the mapping, to obtain the embeddings for the tokens of Tin.
One such criterion, called Vocabulary Initialization with Partial Inheritance (VIPI), was defined by
Samenko et al. (2021). Whenever a token is in Vin but not in Vgen, VIPI calculates all the partitions
of the new token with tokens from Vgen, then takes the minimal partitions and finally averages them
to obtain an embedding for the new token. Differently, we define a simplified implementation of
2
VIPI called FVT for Fast Vocabulary Transfer. Instead of calculating all tokenizations, FVT uses a
straightforward assignment mechanism, whereby each token ti ∈Vin is partitioned using Tgen. If ti
belongs to both vocabularies, ti ∈Vin ∩Vgen, then Tgen(ti) = ti and the in-domain LM embedding.
Ein(ti) = Egen(ti).
(1)
If instead ti ∈Vin \\ Vgen, then the in-domain embedding is the average of the embeddings associated
with the tokens produced by Tgen:
Ein(t :) =
1
|Tgen(ti)|
X
tj∈Tgen(ti)
Egen(tj)
(2)
Please notice that Equation (2) is a generalization of Equation (1). Indeed, in case ti ∈Vin ∩Vgen,
Equation (2) falls back to Equation (1).
Once embeddings are initialized with FVT, we adjust the model’s weights by training it with MLM
on the in-domain data before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. MLM eases adaptation and has
already been found to be beneficial in (Samenko et al., 2021). We observed this trend as well during
preliminary experiments, therefore we kept such a tuning stage in all our experiments.
As a baseline model, we also implement a method called Partial Vocabulary Transfer (PVT), whereby
only the tokens belonging to both vocabularies ti ∈Vin ∩Vgen are initialized with pre-trained
embeddings, while unseen new tokens are randomly initialized.
3.1
Distillation
VT can be combined with other model compression methods like quantization, pruning and KD. For
some of the methods, the combination is trivial, since they have no impact on the vocabulary. KD,
however, requires the vocabularies of the student and teacher to be aligned. Hence, its integration
with VT is non-trivial. Accordingly, we set up a KD procedure with VT, in order to determine the
effects of applying both VT and KD to an LM.
Our distillation consists of two steps. In the first step, we replicate the distillation process used in
(Sanh et al., 2019) for DistilBERT, in which the number of layers of the encoder is halved and a
triple loss-function is applied: a distillation loss, a MLM loss, and a cosine embedding loss. However,
unlike the original setup, we do not remove the token-type embeddings and pooler. after distilling the
student on Dgen, we further distil the student using Din. However, instead of adapting the teacher
before the second distillation, we simply distil the student a second time on the in-domain dataset.
Finally, we apply VT using either FVT or PVT and fine-tune the student model on the in-domain
datasets.
Our choice of applying VT after KD is based on findings by Kim and Hassan (2020), that different
input embedding spaces will produce different output embedding spaces. This difference in spaces is
not conducive to knowledge transfer during distillation. Hence, if VT were to be applied first to the
student, its input embedding space would differ greatly from that of the pre-trained teacher during
distillation.

Experiments
In the experiments we measure the impact of FVT on three main KPIs: quality (F1 score), size of the
models and speedup in inference.
4.1
Experimental Setup
We consider for all our experiments the pre-trained cased version of BERTbase as our pre-trained
language model. Its tokenizer is composed of 28996 wordpieces. We then define four vocabulary
sizes for retraining our tokenizers. Specifically, we take the original vocabulary size and define it
as a vocabulary size of 100 percent. We subsequently reduce this size to 75percent, 50percent, and
25percent, From now on, we will refer to such tokenizers as T100, T75, T50, T25 respectively, while
the original vocabulary will be called Tgen.
3
Models are fine-tuned for 10 epochs with early stopping on the downstream task. We set the initial
learning rate to 3 × 10−5 and batch size to 64 for each task. The sequence length is set to 64 for ADE
and CoNLL03 and 128 for LEDGAR. Each configuration is repeated 3 times with different random
initializations. MLM is performed for one epoch.
4.2
Datasets
To best assess the effectiveness of VT, we apply it on three different tasks from three heterogeneous
linguistic domains: medical (ADE), legal (LEDGAR) and news (CoNLL03). Table 4 reports the
dataset statistics.
ADE. The Adverse Drug Events (ADE) corpus is a binary sentence
classification dataset in the medical domain. This domain is particularly suitable for investigating the
benefits of VT, since documents are characterized by the presence of frequent technical terms, such
as drug and disease names, that are usually rare in common language. Domain-specific words are
usually split into multiple tokens, yielding longer sequences and breaking the semantics of a word
into multiple pieces. An example is shown in Figure 2.
LEDGAR. LEDGAR is a document classification corpus of legal provisions in contracts from
the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The dataset is annotated with 100 different
mutually-exclusive labels. It is also part of LexGLUE, a benchmark for legal language understanding.
CoNLL03. CoNLL03 is a popular Named Entity Recognition (NER) benchmark. It is made of news
stories from the Reuters corpus. We chose this corpus because, differently from ADE and LEDGAR,
the news domain typically uses a more standard language, hence we expect its distribution to differ
less from the one captured by a general-purpose tokenizers in the web. Statistics in Table 1 confirms
this hypothesis. We can observe that the sequence compression gain obtained with domain- specific
tokenizers is less significant with respect to LEDGAR and ADE.

Vocabulary Transfer. From the results shown in Tables 2 and 3, we note a few interesting findings.
First, FVT vectors initialization method consistently outperforms the baseline PVT, which confirms
the positive contribution of Equation 2. Second, transferring vocabulary with FVT causes limited
drops in performance, especially in LEDGAR (the largest one), where F1 slightly increases despite a

Vocabulary Transfer and Distillation. The results summarized in Table 3 clearly indicate that KD
is complementary to VT: there is no harm in applying them together, in terms of performance on
the downstream task. Crucially, this guarantees a full exploitation of FVT in the scope of language
model compression.
Compression and Efficiency. After showcasing that VT has limited impact on performance, we
analyze and discuss its effects on efficiency and model compression. Table 5 reports the relative
F1 drop on the downstream task with respect to the original LM (˘2206F1), the relative reduction in
model size (˘2206Size) and the speedup gained by FVT alone and by FVT combined with KD for
varying vocabulary sizes. Either way, FVT achieves a remarkable 15
Furthermore, the reduced input length enabled by in-domain tokenization brings a reduction in
inference time. The more a language is specialized, the higher is the speedup with in-domain
tokenizers. This is also confirmed by the experiments, where the major benefits are obtained on the
medical domain, with a x1.40 speedup. In CoNLL03 instead where language is much less specialized,
speedup reduces and even disappears with T25. Distillation further pushes compression and speedup
in any benchmark and setup, up to about 55
In summary, depending on the application needs, VT enables a strategic trade-off between compres-
sion rate, inference speed and accuracy.

Conclusion
The viability and success of industrial NLP applications often hinges on a delicate trade-off between
computational requirements, responsiveness and output quality. Hence, language model compression
methods are an active area of research whose practical ramifications are self-evident. One of the
factors that greatly contribute to a model’s inference speed and memory footprint is vocabulary size.
VT has been recently proposed for improving performance, but never so far in the scope of model

compression. In this work, we run an extensive experimental study on the application of a lightweight
method for VT, called FVT. An analysis conducted on various downstream tasks, application domains,
vocabulary sizes and on its possible combination with knowledge distillation indicates that FVT
enables a strategic trade-off between compression rate, inference speed and accuracy, especially, but
not only, in more specialized domains. Importantly, FVT appears to be orthogonal to other model
compression methods.
In the future, we plan to fully integrate Vocabulary Transfer within Knowledge Distillation during the
learning process in order to maximize the information transfer.

P012.pdf,"Harmonizing Scaling Laws: Bridging the Gap
Between Kaplan and Chinchilla
Abstract
Studies by Kaplan et al. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) examined the scaling
characteristics of transformers in next-token language prediction, yielding different
recommendations for configuring the number of parameters (N) and training tokens
(D) to minimize loss within a set compute budget (C). Kaplan suggested an optimal
parameter count scaling with Noptimal ∝C0.73, whereas Chinchilla proposed
Noptimal ∝C0.50. This paper demonstrates that a significant portion of this
difference can be traced back to Kaplan’s focus on non-embedding parameters,
rather than the total parameter count, along with their study’s concentration on a
smaller scale. When the Chinchilla study is simulated under similar circumstances,
biased scaling coefficients similar to those of Kaplan are produced. As a result, this
work confirms Chinchilla’s scaling coefficients by clarifying the primary reason for
Kaplan’s initial overestimation. Additionally, this research clarifies variations in
the stated correlations between computational loss and budget. As a result of these
findings, we advocate for upcoming scaling investigations to utilize total parameter
counts and overall computational resources.
1
Introduction
Two important studies by Kaplan et al. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) examined how scale
affects large language models (LLMs). Both studies provided advice on how to balance model
parameters (N) and training tokens (D) for a fixed computing budget (C), but their suggestions
conflicted. The conclusion drawn from Kaplan’s discovery that Noptimal ∝C0.73 and Doptimal
∝C0.27 was that ""large models might be more crucial than extensive data."" Subsequently, LLMs
trained in the following years allocated more resources to model size and less to data size. The
Chinchilla research that came after that discovered that Noptimal ∝C0.50 and Doptimal ∝C0.50,
which resulted in their main argument that ""for many current LLMs, smaller models should have
been trained on more tokens to achieve the most performant model."" This sparked a trend in which
LLMs with smaller model sizes were trained using more data.
What caused the discrepancy in these scaling coefficient estimates, which resulted in a significant
waste of computer resources, emissions, and money? There have been theories suggesting that
variations in optimization techniques or datasets might account for the differences. This paper argues
that these explanations are insufficient and proposes a straightforward substitute: the majority of
the discrepancy is caused by Kaplan’s decision to count non-embedding parameters instead of total
parameters, together with the limited scale of their investigation.
Additionally, it is discovered that this methodological discrepancy contributes to variations in the
stated correlation between loss and compute.
Specifically, this research provides the following:
• An analytical method is created to assess the scaling relationships described in the studies
(Section 3). If non-embedding parameters are utilized, and at a smaller scale, this method
demonstrates that Kaplan’s documented relationship is locally compatible with Chinchilla’s.
.
• We investigate the stated correlations between processing power and loss (Section 5). Once
more, the cause of Kaplan’s skewed estimate is the use of non-embedding parameters and
smaller scale models, together with the lack of an offset term in their compute-loss equation.
• It is suggested that the scaling community use total parameters, total compute, and an offset
in the compute-loss equation going forward.

Preliminaries
This section provides some foundational information and definitions (Section 2.1), summarizes
the analytical method used for our primary finding (Section 2.2), and documents our assumptions
(Section 2.3).
2.1
Set Up
Kaplan et al. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) conducted empirical studies to model the relationships
between the number of parameters (N), training tokens (D), training compute (C), and loss (L) in
transformers used for language modeling. The primary functional relationship explored was a power
law, y = axb, which is frequently employed in various scientific fields to illustrate the connection
between two quantities (x and y) that span multiple orders of magnitude.
The two studies differed in their definitions of N and C. Kaplan investigated relationships regarding
non-embedding parameters (N
E) and non-embedding compute (C
E), excluding contributions from embedding layers for vocabulary and position indices (NE). In
contrast, Chinchilla studied total parameters (NT) and total compute (CT). We define,
NT = NE + NE,
(1)
NE = (h + v)d,
(2)
where d represents the transformer residual stream’s dimension, v denotes the vocabulary size, and
h stands for the context length (included only when positional embeddings are learned). Utilizing
the typical approximation for training compute FLOPs C = 6ND (where a factor of 6 accounts for a
forward and backward pass), we establish total and non-embedding compute as:
CT = 6NTD = 6(NE + NE)D,
(3)
CE = 6NED.
(4)
The definition of compute, C = 6ND, indicates a direct trade-off between the number of parameters
and training tokens for a specified compute budget. The focus of the two research studies is on
""compute optimal"" configurations, which are the parameter and token combinations that result in the
lowest loss for a given compute budget. This is expressed as follows for total parameters (using ⋆to
denote ""optimal""):
NT = argminL(NT, CT).
(5)
Subject to:
CT = 6NTD
(6)
With this notation, the estimated scaling coefficients can be written more precisely as:
Kaplan : NEC0.73E, Chinchilla : NTC0.50T.
(7)
(It should be noted that although this study concentrates on the scaling coefficient for parameters, the
data coefficient is inferred by subscribing to C = 6ND; N ∝Ca →C/D ∝Ca →D ∝C1−a.)
An important functional form relating NT, D, and L, as used in the Chinchilla study, is:
L(NT, D) = NcNT + DcDΦ03b2 + E,
(8)
2
where Nc, Dc, α, β > 0 are empirically determined constants, and E represents the irreducible loss
inherent in language. This equation conveniently generates power-law relationships: N T ∝Ca T
with a = β / (α + β), D T ∝Cb T with b = α / (α + β), and L T - E ∝C−γ T with γ = αβ / (α + β).
There are two possible specifications based on the constants in Equation 8: those originally reported
in the Chinchilla study and those from a re-analysis by Besiroglu et al. (2024), which claims to
correct minor errors in the fitting procedure. Our work presents results using both specifications.
Chinchilla : Nc = 406.4, Dc = 410.7, = 0.3392,Φ03b2 = 0.2849, E = 1.693 = Φ21d2NTC0.46T,
(9)
EpochAI : Nc = 482.0, Dc = 2085.43, = 0.3478,Φ03b2 = 0.3658, E = 1.817 = Φ21d2NTC0.51T.

Analysis Overview
In our analysis, we use data and insights from the Chinchilla and Kaplan studies to predict the scaling
laws that would result if the Chinchilla relationship were stated in terms of N
E and C
E, and this was done using the smaller model sizes used in Kaplan’s study.
It will be demonstrated that when NT is large, N
E becomes an insignificant component of the model’s parameters and computing cost. As a result, the
two coefficients are in direct opposition to one another in the large parameter regime. The embedding
parameters are not insignificant when NT is smaller (this is the regime examined in Kaplan’s study,
which used parameters ranging from 768 to 1.5B). We discover that the relationship between N
E and C
E is not, in fact, a power law at the lower end of this range. However, fitting a ""local"" power law at
this modest scale yields a coefficient that is comparable to Kaplan’s, roughly reconciling these two
findings.
Our approach in Section 3 is broken down as follows:
• Step 1. Fit a suitable function predicting N
E from NT.
• Step 2. Incorporate this function into a model predicting loss in terms of NT and CT.
• Step 3. Analytically derive the relationship between N
E and C
E.
• Step 4. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in
the Kaplan study. Fit a local power law for N
E in terms of C
E.
Section 4 provides experimental validation of our analysis by training a set of language models at a
very small scale and examining scaling laws under different settings. Simply changing the basis from
NT to N
E yields coefficients consistent with Chinchilla and Kaplan, respectively, while varying token budgets
and decay schedules does not.
A second, connected contribution is made in Section 5. The two studies’ suggested relationships
between loss and computation are reconciled by us. In order to examine the relationship between the
ideal loss L
E and compute C
E, Steps 3 and 4 are carried out once more using a similar analysis as before. To do this, we start with
Chinchilla data and adjust for the smaller model sizes utilized in Kaplan’s investigation, the exclusion
of embedding parameters and compute, and a different fitting function option. We are able to roughly
recover Kaplan’s compute-loss coefficient and reconcile the two studies by making these adjustments.

2.3
Assumptions
For transparency, we list the assumptions and approximations made in our analysis.
• We assume C
E = 6N
ED and CT = 6NT D.
• We assume a fixed functional form between total and non-embedding parameters in Equation
11, and fit ω empirically using Chinchilla model configurations.
• We assume a fixed functional form between loss, total parameters, and training data given
by Equation 8. We report results using both the Chinchilla (Equation 9) and Epoch AI
(Equation 10) fitted constants.
• We approximate Kaplan’s models with 20 logarithmically spaced model sizes from 0.79k to
1.58B non-embedding parameters.

Analysis: Compute-Parameter Scaling Coefficient
This section presents our core analysis. We demonstrate that a local scaling coefficient ranging from
0.74 to 0.78 (close to Kaplan’s 0.73) can emerge when calculated in terms of non-embedding parame-
ters within the small-parameter regime, while remaining consistent with Chinchilla’s coefficient.
Step 1. Fit a suitable function predicting N
E from NT.
We need a suitable function connecting non-embedding and total parameters. We propose to use the
form:
NT = NE +Φ03c9N 1/3E
(11)
for some constant ω > 0. Apart from having several desirable properties (strictly increasing and lim
NT →∞NT = N
E2), it can be supported by findings from both the Kaplan and Chinchilla studies.
Kaplan perspective. Consider Kaplan’s approach to parameter counting:
NT = 12ld2 + NE,
(12)
where l represents the number of layers. While Kaplan does not explicitly list their model configura-
tions, they do explore varying the aspect ratio A = d/l for a fixed model size. They determine that
models of a given size exhibit similar performance across a range of aspect ratios, and this is not
influenced by model scale (their Figure 5). Consequently, we could propose a sizing scheme with a
fixed aspect ratio (A ≈40 appears reasonable from their plots). Assuming this sizing allows us to
state (with l = d/A in Equation 12):
NT = 12
A d3 + NE.
(13)
Observing that N
E = 12
A d3 →d = (N
E A
12)1/3, and combining with NE = (v + h)d,
NT ≈NE + (v + h)( A
12)1/3N1/3E.
(14)
This takes the same form as Equation 11 with ω = (v + h)( A
12)1/3.
Chinchilla perspective. We empirically fit a function NT = N
E + ωNδ
E (note the learnable exponent) to the Chinchilla model configurations listed in Table A9 of Hoffmann
4
et al. (2022) for a range of NT (44M to 16B). We calculate NE from Equation 2, using the reported
vocabulary size of 32,000, but disregard the context length of 2,048 since Chinchilla used non-
learnable position embeddings (though their inclusion only slightly affects the coefficients).
Fitting a model with numpy’s polyfit yields coefficients ω = 47491 and δ = 0.34. The exponent is
close to 1/3, with an implied aspect ratio A = 39.2 (inferred from ω). This further supports the form
in Equation 11.
Step 2. Incorporate this function into a model predicting loss in terms of NT and CT.
It should be remembered that although we are interested in how N T depends on CT, this only occurs
because of how they both relate to loss.
NT = argminL(NT, CT).
(15)
Subject to:
CT = 6NTD
(16)
To analytically examine their scaling relationship, we need a mathematical expression for loss, for
which we utilize the functional form from the Chinchilla study. Substituting CT = 6NT D into
Equation 8 yields:
L(NT, CT) = NcNT + Dc(CT/6NT)Φ03b2 + E.
(17)
By differentiating Equation 16 with respect to NT, setting the result to zero, and rearranging in terms
of NT, we obtain:
NT = CT
β
α+β ( βDc
α6βNc)
1
α+β , orsimplyNT ∝C
β
α+β
(18)
We now modify Equation 16 to be in terms of non-embedding parameters and compute. While NT
requires Equation 11 from step 1, the second term avoids this because D = CT / 6NT = C
E / 6N
E.
L(NE, CE) = Nc(NE +Φ03c9N 1/3E)α + Dc(CE/6NE)β + E
(19)
Step 3. Analytically derive the relationship between N
E and C
E.
To determine the relationship between N
E and C
E, we take the derivative of Equation 18 with respect to N
E, set it to zero, and rearrange:
CE = 6NE(NE + ω(NE)1/3)α( βDc
αNc)(
1
1 + ω
3 (NE)−2/3
+ α)−1 (20)
This indicates that, generally, the relationship between N
E and C
E is not a power law. Nevertheless, we can think about a ""local"" power law approximation. That is,
for a specific value of N
E, there exists a constant g that provides a first-order approximation (denoted by ∝) N
E, where g is defined as:
g := dlog(CE)
dlog(NE) =
1
1 −1
β
ω
3 (NE)−2/3
5
1+ ω
3 (NE)−2/3 + α + 1 β ω
3 (NE)−2/3 1+ ω
3 (NE)−2/3 . (21)
The derivation is detailed in Appendix A.1. There are three phases.
• At a small scale, lim N
E →0 g = α/3+β
β
→N
E ∝C
β
α/3+β
E.
• At a large scale, lim N
E →∞g = α+β
β
→N
E ∝C
β
α+β
E, consistent with the NT case in Equation 17.
• A transition phase exists where g briefly increases. This occurs between the two limits when
N2/3
E is of the same order as ω. Indeed, at exactly the point N2/3
E = ω, we have NT = N
E + ωN1/3
E = NT = 2N
E, indicating a 50/50 split between embedding and non-embedding parameters.
Step 4. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in the
Kaplan study. Fit a local power law for N
E in terms of C
E.
By reading g, we could estimate a local power law and thus a scaling coefficient for a specific value
of N
E. However, it is unclear which N
E value is representative of the Kaplan study. We choose a more accurate estimation approach,
creating synthetic training curves from Equation 18 over the range of model sizes employed in the
Kaplan study, and fitting coefficients using models that lie on the compute-efficient frontier. This will
also validate our analytical expression for N
E and C
E in Equation 19.
We simulated 20 models with N
E ranging from 790 parameters to 1.58B (Kaplan reports using model sizes ""ranging in size from
768 to 1.5 billion non-embedding parameters""). For other constants in Equation 18, we adopt the
Epoch AI specification (Equation 10) and ω = 47491, though we also report results for the Chinchilla
specification (Equation 9).
Main result. The estimated scaling coefficient is shown when a power law is fitted to the compute
optimal frontier (Chinchilla’s Method 1) generated by these synthetic training curves. This represents
our primary finding - by starting with a model from the Chinchilla study and modifying two aspects
to match Kaplan’s study (NT →N
E, small model sizes 0.79k - 1.58B parameters), we obtain local scaling coefficients:
EpochAI : NEC0.78E,
(22)
Chinchilla : NEC0.74E,
(23)
which are close to the Kaplan coefficient of 0.73. Therefore, this demonstrates that the Chinchilla co-
efficient is largely consistent with Kaplan’s coefficient, given these two adjustments. This constitutes
the paper’s main result, reconciling these two apparently conflicting results.

Experiments: Compute-Parameter Scaling Coefficient
We offer concise experiments to confirm that our assertions are valid for models trained on a limited
scale (millions of parameters).
Experiment 1. First, we confirm if scaling coefficients approximate those of Chinchilla and Kaplan
when employing NT and N
E, respectively.
Five models with sizes NT ∈[0.8M, 1.6M, 2.1M, 3.3M, 4.6M] were trained using the BookCorpus
dataset. The GPT-2 tokenizer was used, with a vocabulary size of 50,257 and a context length of
16 (although this is much less than normal, our tests indicate that context length has no impact on
scaling coefficients). To estimate scaling coefficients, Chinchilla’s Method 1 was applied, using the
approximation C = 6ND.
Models were trained for updates ∈[4000, 4000, 4000, 8000, 8000], with a batch size of 65,536
tokens per update, for a total of training tokens D ∈[262M, 262M, 262M, 524M, 524M]. For each
model size, the optimal learning rate was selected from ∈[0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05], and no annealing
was implemented.
Result 1. When coefficients are fitted to NT, we obtain NT ∝C0.49T, and for N
E, we obtain N
E ∝C0.74
E. These closely match the Chinchilla and Kaplan coefficients, respectively.
Experiment 2. We present an ablation of optimization schemes, demonstrating that using multi-
ple training budgets per model has a negligible impact on coefficients (contrary to Chinchilla’s
explanation).
• Scheme 1. A single learning rate of 0.001 is set for all models. A single model is trained per
size, and no annealing is applied.
• Scheme 2. The best learning rate is chosen per model. A single model is trained per size,
and no annealing is applied. (As in our NT vs. N
E comparison.)
• Scheme 3. The best learning rate is chosen per model. A single model is trained per size,
and cosine annealing is applied at the update budget. (Kaplan study used this.)
• Scheme 4. The best learning rate is chosen per model. Six models are trained per size at
different budgets ∈[0.25D, 0.5D, 0.75D, 1.0D, 1.5D, 2.0D], and cosine annealing is applied.
(Chinchilla study used this.)
Result 2. The optimization technique has less of an influence on scaling coefficients than switching
from NT to N
E. Using a single set of models without annealing (scheme 2) yields coefficients that are identical to
those of the more computationally demanding scheme 4. In contrast to Chinchilla’s assertion that
switching from Kaplan’s scheme 3 to scheme 4 would lower the scaling coefficient, our research
indicates the opposite, with an increase from 0.46 to 0.49. This might account for our minor
overestimation of the scaling coefficients in Equations 21 and 22.
Table 1: Comparison of different scaling coefficients from our experiments. Note that the change
moving from NT to N
E has a much larger effect than moving between optimization schemes.

Analysis: Compute-Loss Scaling Coefficient
In addition to examining the compute-optimal parameter scaling, Kaplan and Chinchilla also char-
acterized the scaling relationship between compute and loss, assuming optimal parameter scaling.
Kaplan expressed this optimal loss in terms of non-embedding compute, while Chinchilla used total
compute.
LE = minL(NE, CE), s.t.CE = 6NED,
(24)
7
LT = minL(NT, CT), s.t.CT = 6NTD.
(25)
Specifically, the two studies reported the following forms and coefficients linking optimal loss and
compute:
Kaplan : LE = (CE
Co
)γ
(26)
Kaplan : LEC0.057E
(27)
Chinchilla : LTE = (CT
Co
)−γ
(28)
Chinchilla : LTEC0.155T
(29)
EpochAI : LTEC0.178T
(30)
(Refer to Section A.3 for Chinchilla’s compute coefficient.) Similar to the compute-parameter scaling
coefficient, Kaplan’s coefficient of 0.057 initially appears significantly different from Chinchilla’s
range of 0.155 to 0.178. However, we will again demonstrate that by starting with the Chinchilla
study and adjusting for Kaplan’s non-embedding compute, smaller scale, and their compute-loss
form, these two coefficients can be largely reconciled.
Our analysis follows the same four-step approach as in Section 3. We can directly reuse Steps 1 and
2, while Steps 3 and 4 are now modified to study the relationship between optimal loss and compute,
rather than optimal parameters and compute as previously.
Step 3. Analytically derive the relationship between L
E and C
E.
We determine that the relationship between L
E and C
E is not a power law (derived in Section A.2).
dlog(LE)
dlog(CE) = NE(NE + ω(NE)1/3
)α (1 1+ ω
3 (NE)−2/3 ) LE(6NE)β (31)
Nevertheless, we can once more take into account a local first-order approximation, L
E ∝Ck
E, where k = dlog(LE)
dlog(CE).
Step 4. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in the
Kaplan study. Fit a local power law for L
E in terms of C
E, using Kaplan’s compute-loss form.
As in Section 3, we could use Equation 30 to calculate a point estimate for k in the relationship L
E ∝Ck
E, and then fit. However, we again opt for the more faithful procedure of simulating data from the
loss curves.
Using Kaplan’s compute-loss form L
E = ( CE
Co )γ, we obtain the following models for the two specifications:
EpochAI : LECE,
(32)
Chinchilla : LECE,
(33)
which are roughly in line with Kaplan’s reported coefficient of L
E ∝C−0.057
E.
8
We observe that Kaplan’s form provides a good fit of the data in the non-embedding compute plot
at a small scale, over the range of model sizes they considered. We speculate that this might be the
motivation for Kaplan’s selection of this simpler compute-loss form.

Related work
After early research that established how language models get better with parameters, data, and
training computation, there has been research into the theoretical underpinnings of these scaling laws
and whether they apply to other domains.
Several concurrent studies that have looked at how different design decisions affect scaling law
analyses are more closely related to the spirit of our work. The methodology for determining scaling
coefficients is revisited by Su et al. (2024). Hagele et al. (2024) discovered that multiple short
decays with a constant learning rate or stochastic weight averaging may be used to recreate numerous
independent cosine schedules more effectively. Our discovery is subtly different; a straightforward
fixed learning rate will recover extremely comparable compute-parameter scaling coefficients as
many cosine schedules. The impact of different hyperparameters on scaling laws is examined by Bi
et al. (2024). They point out that different text datasets yield somewhat different optimal coefficients,
with ""cleaner"" data exhibiting more parameter-hungry scaling behavior, which they believe may
partially account for the discrepancy between the Kaplan and Chinchilla coefficients.
The goal of Porian et al. (2024)’s concurrent work is to clarify the discrepancies between the Kaplan
and Chinchilla coefficients, which is the same goal as that of our paper. They conduct a number
of large-scale experiments that replicate Kaplan’s study, and they come to the conclusion that the
discrepancy is caused by, in decreasing order of importance: 1) Kaplan’s use of non-embedding
compute rather than total compute; 2) Kaplan’s use of an excessively long fixed-length warmup
period for smaller models, which made them appear less efficient; and 3) Kaplan’s failure to fully
optimize hyperparameters. We believe that these findings complement our own. We have used
an entirely analytical method to identify the main ""first order"" cause using just the data that was
made publicly available in the two papers. (As a form of verification, tiny-scale experiments were
conducted post-hoc.) This shows how mathematical techniques can be used in scaling’s empirical
science.

Discussion
This study sought to account for the disparity between the scaling coefficients of Kaplan and
Chinchilla. We discovered two problems with Kaplan’s study that, when taken together, biased their
estimated scaling coefficients: they focused on smaller model sizes and only counted coefficients:
they focused on smaller model sizes and only counted non-embedding parameters. This implies
a curvature in the actual relationship between Nand NT (Figure 5). At greater values of NT, the
embedding parameter counts become negligible, NT = N, and differences would not arise. Alterna-
tively, had Kaplan investigated relationships directly in terms of NT, this issue would also not occur,
even at this smaller scale (confirmed by our Experiment 1 finding NT (∝)C(0.49)TevenforNT <
5M).TheformKaplanusedtopredictlossfromcomputefurthercontributedtodifferencesinthereportedcompute−
lossscalingcoefficients.
Inconsistency across scaling studies. Existing literature on scaling is not consistent in its use of
non-embedding vs. total compute. Some studies follow Kaplan’s approach, using non-embedding
parameters or compute, while others adhere to the Chinchilla approach, using total parameters. Our
work indicates that this choice can substantially alter scaling exponents, complicating cross-study
comparisons. Similarly, the choice of compute-loss equation varies through the literature. Studies
such as opt for the Kaplan compute-loss form without offsets. In contrast, employ the Chinchilla
compute-loss form with non-zero offsets. Again, our work suggests that these methodological
differences can lead to significant variations in scaling predictions and interpretations.
The lack of a standardized approach in scaling studies risks making comparisons misleading and
insights less clear. We see our work as helping to understand certain decisions made in previous
studies that should be standardized. Concretely, we advise future studies to report total, rather than
non-embedding, parameters, and to include an offset in the compute-loss fitting models. We discuss
motivation for these choices below. Furthermore, our initial evidence does not support using multiple
9
cosine decays per model size – we find a single fixed learning rate per model size is sufficient for
measuring compute-optimal parameter coefficients.
Why should embedding parameters contribute to scaling behavior? Several works provide evidence
that embedding parameters capture meaningful language properties. Word embeddings can be
factorized into semantically interpretable factors (even the shallow Word2vec). LLMs learn linear
embeddings of space and time across scales. Developing such meaningful embedding structures
allows LLMs to perform high-level language operations, such as arithmetic. Therefore, if one believes
that the embedding layer does more than just ‘translate’ tokens to a vector of the correct dimension,
we see no reason to exclude them in the parameter count.
Why should a non-zero offset be used in loss-compute predictions? The Chinchilla compute-loss form
with a non-zero offset (Equation 27) is a more appropriate form from the perspective of statistical
learning. This approach accounts for the concept of irreducible risk, which posits a lower bound on
achievable loss regardless of model or dataset size. This may arise from various factors: inherent
biases or limitations in the learning algorithm, or noise in the original task. As a concrete example in
language modeling, the best a model can do for the prediction of the first token in a sequence is to
estimate the marginal distribution of all tokens, which leads to a non-zero loss.
Limitations. We acknowledge several limitations of our analysis. We have aimed to capture the
primary ‘first order’ reason for the difference between the Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling coefficients.
But there are multiple other differences between the two studies that likely also affect scaling coeffi-
cients (Section 6); datasets (Kaplan used OpenWebText2, Chinchilla used MassiveText), transformer
details (Kaplan used learnable position embeddings while Chinchilla’s were fixed, also differing
tokenizers, vocabularly sizes), optimization scheme (Kaplan used scheme 3, Chinchilla scheme
4, also differing warmup schedules), differences in computation counting (Kaplan used C = 6ND,
Chinchilla’s Method 1 and 2 used a full calculation). However, our work suggested these factors
impact coefficients in a more minor way.

P110.pdf,"LIDA: Lightweight Interactive Dialogue Annotator
Abstract
Dialogue systems are highly dependent on the quality of the data used to train them. It is therefore important to
develop good dialogue annotation tools which can improve the speed and quality of dialogue data annotation.
With this in mind, we introduce LIDA, an annotation tool designed specifically for conversation data. As far as we
know, LIDA is the first dialogue annotation system that handles the entire dialogue annotation pipeline from raw
text, as may be the output of transcription services, to structured conversation data. Furthermore it supports the
integration of arbitrary machine learning models as annotation recommenders and also has a dedicated interface to
resolve inter-annotator disagreements such as after crowdsourcing annotations for a dataset. LIDA is fully open
source, documented and publicly available.
1
Introduction
Dialogue systems are becoming one of the most active research areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning
(ML). Creating a high-quality dialogue dataset incurs a large annotation cost, which makes good dialogue annotation tools essential
to ensure the highest possible quality. Many annotation tools exist for a range of NLP tasks but none are designed specifically for
dialogue with modern usability principles in mind.
LIDA is a web application designed to make dialogue dataset creation and annotation as easy and fast as possible. In addition to
following modern principles of usability, LIDA integrates best practices from other state-of-the-art annotation tools, most importantly
by allowing arbitrary ML models to be integrated as annotation recommenders to suggest annotations for data. Any system with the
correct API can be integrated into LIDA’s back end, meaning LIDA can be used as a front end for researchers to interact with their
dialogue systems and correct their responses, then save the interaction as a future test case.
When data is crowdsourced, it is good practice to have multiple annotators label each piece of data to reduce noise and mislabelling.
Once you have multiple annotations, it is important to be able to resolve conflicts by highlighting where annotators disagreed so
that an arbiter can decide on the correct annotation. To this end, LIDA provides a dedicated interface which automatically finds
where annotators have disagreed and displays the labels alongside a percentage of how many annotators selected each label, with the
majority annotated labels selected by default.

Main Contributions
Our main contributions with this tool are:
• A modern annotation tool designed specifically for task-oriented conversation data
• The first dialogue annotator capable of handling the full dialogue annotation pipeline from turn and dialogue segmentation
through to labelling structured conversation data
• Easy integration of dialogue systems and recommenders to provide annotation suggestions
• A dedicated interface to resolve inter-annotator disagreements for dialogue data

Various annotation tools have been developed for NLP tasks in recent years. Table 1 compares LIDA with other recent annotation
tools. TWIST is a dialogue annotation tool which consists of two stages: turn segmentation and content feature annotation. Turn
segmentation allows users to highlight and create new turn segments from raw text. After this, users can annotate sections of text in
a segment by highlighting them and selecting from a predefined feature list. However, this tool doesn’t allow users to specify custom
annotations or labels and doesn’t support classification or slot-value annotation.
INCEpTION is a semantic annotation platform for interactive tasks that require semantic resources like entity linking. It provides
machine learning models to suggest annotations and allows users to collect and model knowledge directly in the tool. GATE is an

open source tool that provides predefined solutions for many text processing tasks. It is powerful because it allows annotators to
enhance the provided annotation tools with their own Java code, making it easily extensible and provides an enormous number of
predefined features. However, GATE is a large and complicated tool with a significant setup cost. Despite their large feature sets,
INCEpTION and GATE are not designed for annotating dialogue and cannot display data as turns, an important feature for dialogue
datasets.
BRAT and Doccano are web-based annotation tools for tasks such as text classification and sequence labeling. They have intuitive
and user-friendly interfaces which aim to make the creation of certain types of dataset such as classification or sequence labelling
datasets as fast as possible. BRAT also supports annotation suggestions by integrating ML models. However, like INCEpTION and
GATE, they are not designed for annotating dialogues and do not support generation of formatted conversational data from a raw
text file such as may be output by a transcription service. LIDA aims to fill these gaps by providing a lightweight, easy-to-setup
annotation tool which displays data as a series of dialogues, supports integration of arbitrary ML models as recommenders and
supports segmentation of raw text into dialogues and turns.
DialogueView is a tool for dialogue annotation. However, the main use-cases are not focused on building dialogue systems, rather it is
focused on segmenting recorded conversations. It supports annotating audio files as well as discourse segmentation - hence, granular
labelling of the dialogue, recommenders, inter-annotator agreement, and slot-value labelling is not possible with DialogueView.

System Overview
LIDA is built according to a client-server architecture with the front end written in standard web languages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
that will run on any browser. The back end written in Python using the Flask web framework as a RESTful API.
The main screen which lists all available dialogues. The buttons below this list allow a user to add a blank or formatted dialogue
file. Users can also drag and drop files in this screen to upload them. The user is then able to add, delete or edit any particular
dialogue. There is also a button to download the whole dataset as a JSON file on this page. Clicking on a dialogue will take users to
the individual dialogue annotation screen.
LIDA uses the concept of a “turn” to organise how a dialogue is displayed and recorded. A turn consists of a query by the user
followed by a response from the system, with an unlimited number of labels allowed for each user query. The user query and
system response are displayed in the large area on the left of the interface, while the labels for each turn are shown in the scrollable
box on the right. There are two forms that these labels can currently take which are particularly relevant for dialogue: multilabel
classification and slot-value pair.
An example of multilabel classification is whether the user was informing the system or requesting a piece of information. An
example of a slot-value pair is whether the user mentioned the type of restaurant they’d like to eat at (slot: restaurant-type) and if so
what it was (value: italian, for example). The front-end code is written in a modular form so that it is easy for researchers
3.0.1
Experimenting with Dialogue Systems
LIDA is designed with this in mind - a dialogue system can be integrated into the back end so that it will run whenever the user
enters a new query in the front end. The user will then be able to evaluate whether the system gave the correct answer and correct the
labels it gets wrong using the front end. LIDA will record these corrections and allow the user to download the interaction with their
dialogue system with the corrected labels so that it can be used as a test case in future versions of the system.
3.0.2
Creating a New Dialogue Dataset
Users can create a blank dialogue on LIDA’s home screen, then enter queries in the box shown at the bottom of the screen. Along
with whole dialogue systems, arbitrary ML models can be added as recommenders in the back end. Once the user hits ""Enter"",
the query is run through the recommender models in the back end and the suggested annotations displayed for the label. If no
recommender is specified in the back end, the label will be left blank. Users can delete turns and navigate between them using
2
""Enter"" or the arrow keys. The name of the dialogue being annotated can be seen next to the ""Back"" button at the top left of the
screen and can be edited by clicking on it.
3.0.3
Annotating An Existing Dataset
Datasets can be uploaded via drag-and-drop to the home screen of the system, or paths can be specified in the back end if the
system were being used for crowdsourcing. Datasets can be in one of two forms, either a "".txt"" file such as may be produced by a
transcription service, or a formatted "".json"" file, a common format for dialogue data. Once the user has uploaded their data, their
dialogue(s) will appear on the home screen. The user can click on each dialogue and will be taken to the single dialogue annotation
screen to annotate it. If the user uploaded a text file, they will be taken to a dialogue and turn segmentation screen. Following the
same constraints imposed in previous works, this turn segmenter assumes that there are only two participants in the dialogue: the
user and the system, and that the user asks the first query. The user separates each utterance in the dialogue by a blank line, and
separates dialogues with a triple equals sign (""===""). Once the user clicks ""Done"", the text file will automatically be parsed into the
correct JSON format and each query run through the recommenders in the back-end to obtain annotation suggestions.
3.0.4
Resolving Annotator Disagreement
Researchers could use LIDA’s main interface to crowdsource annotations for a dialogue dataset. Once they have several annotations
for each dialogue, they can upload these to the inter-annotator resolution interface of LIDA. The disagreements between annotators
will be detected, with a percentage shown beside each label to show how many annotators selected it. The label with the highest
percentage of selections is checked by default. The arbiter can accept the majority label simply by pressing ""Enter"" and can change
errors with the arrow keys to facilitate fast resolution. This interface also displays an averaged (over turns) version of Cohen’s Kappa,
the total number of annotations, the total number of errors, and the averaged (over turns) accuracy.
3.1
Features
Specifying Custom Labels LIDA’s configuration is controlled by a single script in the back end. This script defines which labels
will be displayed in the UI and is easy to extend. Users can define their own labels by altering this configuration script. If a user
wishes to add a new label, all they need to do is specify the label’s name, its type (classification or slot-value pair, currently) and the
possible values the classification can take. Alongside the label specification, they can also specify a recommender to use for the label
values. The label will then automatically be displayed in the front end. Note that labels in uploaded datasets will only be displayed if
the label has an entry in the configuration file.
Custom Recommenders When creating a dialogue dataset from scratch, LIDA is most powerful when used in conjunction with
recommenders which can suggest annotations for user queries to be corrected by the annotator. State-of-the-art tools emphasize the
importance of being able to use recommenders in annotation systems. Users can specify arbitrary ML models to use for each label in
LIDA’s back end. The back end is written in Python, the de facto language for machine learning, so researchers can directly integrate
models written in Python to the back end. This is in contrast to tools such as INCEpTION and GATE which are written in Java
and so require extra steps to integrate a Python-based model. To integrate a recommender, the user simply provides an instantiated
Python object in the configuration file that has a method called ""transform"" that takes a single string and returns a predicted label.
Dialogue and Turn Segmentation from Raw Data When uploading a .txt file, users can segment each utterance and each dialogue
with a simple interface. This means that raw dialogue data with no labels, such as obtained from a transcription service, can be
uploaded and processed into a labelled dialogue. Segmented dialogues and turns are automatically run through every recommender
to give suggested labels for each utterance.
4
Evaluation
To test LIDA’s capabilities, we designed a simple experiment: we took a bespoke dataset of 154 dialogues with an average of 3.5
turns per dialogue and a standard deviation of 1.55. The task was to assign three classification labels to each user utterance in each
dialogue. Each annotator was given a time limit of 1 hour and told to annotate as many dialogues as they could in that time. We had
six annotators perform this task, three of whom were familiar with the system and three of whom had never seen it before.
These annotators annotated an average of 79 dialogues in one hour with a standard deviation of 30, which corresponds to an
average of 816.5 individual annotations. The annotators who had never seen the system before annotated an average of 60 dialogues
corresponding to an average of 617 individual annotations.
Once we had these six annotations, we performed a second experiment whereby a single arbiter resolved inter-annotator disagree-
ments. In one hour, the arbiter resolved 350 disagreements and noted that resolution.

P061.pdf,"Enhancing Visual Representation Learning Through
Original Image Utilization in Contrastive Learning
Abstract
Contrastive instance discrimination techniques exhibit superior performance in
downstream tasks, including image classification and object detection, compared to
supervised learning. However, a strong reliance on data augmentation during repre-
sentation learning is a hallmark of these methods, potentially causing suboptimal
outcomes if not meticulously executed. A prevalent data augmentation approach in
contrastive learning involves random cropping followed by resizing. This practice
might diminish the quality of representation learning when two random crops
encompass disparate semantic information. To counter this, we propose an inno-
vative framework termed LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive
Learning of Visual Representations). This framework integrates a novel instance
discrimination strategy and a refined loss function, effectively mitigating the loss
of crucial semantic features that may arise from mapping different object segments
during representation learning. Our empirical evaluations reveal that LeOCLR con-
sistently enhances representation learning across a spectrum of datasets, surpassing
baseline models. Notably, LeOCLR exhibits a 5.1% improvement over MoCo-v2
on ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and demonstrates superior performance in
transfer learning and object detection tasks compared to several other techniques.
1
Introduction
Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on instance discrimination are heavily dependent on
data augmentations, like random cropping, rotation, and color jitter, to construct invariant repre-
sentations for all instances within a dataset. These augmentations are used to generate two altered
views (positive pairs) of the same instance, which are subsequently drawn closer in the latent space.
Simultaneously, strategies are employed to prevent a collapse to a trivial solution, commonly referred
to as representation collapse. The efficacy of these methods in acquiring meaningful representations
has been demonstrated through various downstream tasks, such as image classification and object
detection, serving as proxies for evaluating representation learning. However, these techniques
often overlook the crucial aspect that augmented views may diverge in semantic content because
of random cropping, potentially degrading the quality of visual representation learning. Creating
positive pairs via random cropping and subsequently prompting the model to align them based on
shared information in both views poses an increased challenge to the SSL task, ultimately leading to
an enhancement in representation quality. Moreover, random cropping followed by resizing guides
the model’s representation to encompass object-related information across diverse aspect ratios,
thereby promoting invariance to occlusions. Conversely, minimizing the feature distance in the latent
space, which equates to maximizing similarity, between views that encompass distinct semantic
concepts may inadvertently discard valuable image information.
Instances of incorrect semantic positive pairs, which are pairs containing mismatched semantic
information about the same object, might arise from random cropping. When the model is compelled
to align the representations of different parts of an object closer in the latent space, it may discard
crucial semantic features. This occurs because the model’s representations are based on the shared
area between the two views. If this shared region lacks semantically consistent information, the
.
representations become trivial. For random cropping to be effective and achieve occlusion invariance,
the shared area must convey the same semantic meaning in both views. Nevertheless, contrasting
pairs that might include diverse semantic information about the same object can be valuable, as it can
facilitate learning global features.
The creation of random crops for a one-centric object does not ensure the acquisition of accurate
semantic pairs. This observation holds significant importance for the enhancement of representation
learning. Instance discrimination SSL techniques encourage the model to approximate positive pairs,
i.e., two views of the same instance, in the latent space, irrespective of their semantic content. This
limitation might hinder the model’s ability to learn representations of different object components
and could potentially impair its capability to learn semantic feature representations (see Figure 2
(left) in the original paper).
Undesirable views containing different semantic content may be unavoidable when employing random
cropping. Therefore, a method is needed to train the model on different parts of an object, developing
robust representations against natural transformations like scale and occlusion, rather than merely
pulling augmented views together indiscriminately. Addressing this issue is vital, as downstream task
performance relies on high-quality visual representations learned through self-supervised learning.
Our work presents a new instance discrimination SSL approach designed to avoid compelling the
model to create similar representations for two positive views, irrespective of their semantic content.
As shown in Figure 2 (right) of the original paper, we incorporate the original image X into the
training process, since it contains all the semantic features of the views X1 and X2. In our method, the
positive pairs (i.e., X1 and X2) are drawn towards the original image X in the latent space, in contrast
to contrastive state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches like SimCLR and MoCo-v2, which draw the two
views towards each other. This training method guarantees that the information in the shared region
between the attracted views (X, X1) and (X, X2) is semantically accurate. Consequently, the model
acquires enhanced semantic features by aligning with the appropriate semantic content, rather than
matching random views that might contain disparate semantic information. In essence, the model
learns representations of various object parts because the shared region encompasses correct semantic
components of the object. This contrasts with other methods that may discard vital semantic features
by incorrectly mapping object parts in positive pairs. Our contributions are outlined as follows:
• We present a new contrastive instance discrimination SSL method, LeOCLR, created to
minimize the loss of semantic features caused by mapping two semantically inconsistent
random views.
• We establish that our method enhances visual representation learning in contrastive instance
discrimination SSL, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques across a variety of downstream
tasks.
• We show that our method consistently improves visual representation learning for contrastive
instance discrimination across multiple datasets and contrastive mechanisms.

Related Work
Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques are categorized into two primary groups: contrastive and
non-contrastive learning. While all these techniques endeavor to approximate positive pairs in the
latent space, they employ distinct strategies to circumvent representation collapse.
**Contrastive Learning:** Instance discrimination techniques, such as SimCLR, MoCo, and PIRL,
employ a similar concept. These methods bring the positive pairs closer while driving the negative
pairs apart in the embedding space, albeit through different mechanisms. SimCLR employs an
end-to-end strategy where a large batch size is utilized for negative examples, and the parameters of
both encoders in the Siamese network are updated simultaneously. PIRL uses a memory bank for
negative examples, and both encoders’ parameters are updated together. MoCo adopts a momentum
contrastive approach where the query encoder is updated during backpropagation, which subsequently
updates the key encoder. Negative examples are maintained in a separate dictionary, facilitating the
use of large batch sizes.
**Non-Contrastive Learning:** Non-contrastive techniques utilize solely positive pairs to learn
visual representations, employing a variety of strategies to prevent representation collapse. The
2
initial category encompasses clustering-based techniques, where samples exhibiting similar features
are assigned to the same cluster. DeepCluster employs pseudo-labels from the previous iteration,
rendering it computationally demanding and challenging to scale. SWAV addresses this challenge by
implementing online clustering, though it necessitates determining the correct number of prototypes.
The second category involves knowledge distillation. Techniques like BYOL and SimSiam utilize
knowledge distillation methods, where a Siamese network comprises an online encoder and a target
encoder. The target network’s parameters are not updated during backpropagation. Instead, solely
the online network’s parameters are updated while being encouraged to predict the representation of
the target network. Despite the encouraging results, the mechanism by which these methods prevent
collapse remains not fully understood. Inspired by BYOL, Self-distillation with no labels (DINO)
employs centering and sharpening, along with a distinct backbone (ViT), enabling it to surpass other
self-supervised techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Another method, Bag of
visual words (BoW), employs a teacher-student framework inspired by natural language processing
(NLP) to avert representation collapse. The student network predicts a histogram of the features for
augmented images, analogous to the teacher network’s histogram. The final category is information
maximization. Methods like Barlow twins and VICReg eschew negative examples, stop gradient,
or clustering. Instead, they utilize regularization to avoid representation collapse. The objective
function of these techniques seeks to eliminate redundant information in the embeddings by aligning
the correlation of the embedding vectors closer to the identity matrix. While these techniques exhibit
encouraging results, they possess limitations, including the sensitivity of representation learning to
regularization and reduced effectiveness if certain statistical properties are absent in the data.
**Instance Discrimination With Multi-Crops:** Various SSL techniques introduce multi-crop strate-
gies to enable models to learn visual representations of objects from diverse perspectives. However,
when generating multiple cropped views from the same object instance, these views might contain
disparate semantic information. To tackle this issue, LoGo generates two random global crops and
N local views. They posit that global and local views of an object share similar semantic content,
enhancing similarity between these views. Simultaneously, they contend that different local views
possess distinct semantic content, thus diminishing similarity among them. SCFS proposes a different
approach for managing unmatched semantic views by searching for semantically consistent features
between the contrasted views. CLSA generates multiple crops and applies both strong and weak
augmentations, using distance divergence loss to enhance instance discrimination in representation
learning. Prior methods assume that global views contain similar semantic content and treat them
indiscriminately as positive pairs. However, our technique suggests that global views might contain
incorrect semantic pairs due to random cropping, as illustrated in Figure 1 in the original paper.
Therefore, we aim to attract the two global views to the original (intact and uncropped) image, which
fully encapsulates the semantic features of the crops.
3
Methodology
The mapping of incorrect semantic positive pairs, specifically those containing different semantic
views, results in the loss of semantic features, which in turn degrades the model’s representation
learning. To address this, we propose a novel contrastive instance discrimination SSL strategy called
LeOCLR. Our approach is designed to capture meaningful features from two random positive pairs,
even when they encompass different semantic content, thereby improving representation learning.
Achieving this necessitates ensuring the semantic correctness of the information within the shared
region between the attracted views. This is crucial because the selection of views dictates the
information captured by the representations learned in contrastive learning. Given that we cannot
guarantee the inclusion of correct semantic parts of the object within the shared region between the
two views, we propose the inclusion of the original image in the training process. The original image
X, which is not subjected to random cropping, encompasses all the semantic features of the two
cropped views, X1 and X2.
Our method, illustrated in Figure 3 (left) in the original paper, generates three views (X, X1, and
X2). The original image (X) is resized without cropping, while the other views (X1 and X2) undergo
random cropping and resizing. All views are then randomly augmented to prevent the model from
learning trivial features. We employ data augmentations akin to those used in MoCo-v2. The original
image (X) is encoded by the encoder fq, while the two views (X1, X2) are encoded by a momentum
encoder fk. The parameters of fk are updated using the formula:
3
θk ←mθk + (1 −m)θq (1)
where m is a coefficient set to 0.999, θq represents the encoder parameters of fq updated through
backpropagation, and θk denotes the momentum encoder parameters of fk updated by θq. Ultimately,
the objective function compels the model to draw both views (X1, X2) closer to the original image
(X) in the embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart all other instances, as depicted in
Figure 3 (right) in the original paper.
3.1
Loss function
Initially, we briefly outline the loss function of MoCo-v2, given our utilization of momentum
contrastive learning. Subsequently, we will detail our modification to the loss function.
ℓ(u, v+) = −log
exp(u·v+/τ)
PP N
n=0 exp(u·vn/τ) (2)
where similarity is quantified by the dot product. The objective function amplifies the similarity
between the positive pairs (u . v+) by drawing them closer in the embedding space, while simultane-
ously driving apart all the negative samples (vn) in the dictionary to prevent representation collapse.
τ denotes the temperature hyperparameter of the softmax function. In our method, we augment the
similarity between the original image’s feature representation, u = fq(x), and the positive pair’s feature
representation, v+ = fk(xi) (i = 1, 2), while driving apart all the negative examples (vn). Consequently,
the total loss for the mini-batch is:
lt = PN
i=1 ℓ(ui, sg(v1
i )) + ℓ(ui, sg(v2
i )) (3)
where sg(.) denotes the stop-gradient operation, which is vital for averting representation collapse.
As depicted in Equation 3, the total loss lt attracts the two views (v1
i and v2
i ) to their original instance
ui. This enables the model to capture semantic features from the two random views, even if they
contain different semantic information. Our technique captures improved semantic features compared
to prior contrastive methods, as we ensure that the shared region between the attracted views contains
accurate semantic information. Since the original image contains all segments of the object, any part
contained in the random crop is also present in the original image. Thus, when we draw the original
image and the two random views closer in the embedding space, the model learns representations
of the different parts, creating an occlusion-invariant representation of the object across various
scales and angles. This contrasts with earlier techniques, which draw the two views together in the
embedding space regardless of their semantic content, leading to the loss of semantic features.
Equation 3 and Algorithm 1 in the original paper highlight the primary distinctions between our
method and prior multi-crop techniques, such as CLSA, SCFC, and DINO. The key differences are
as follows:
• Previous methods assume that two global views contain identical semantic information,
encouraging the model to concentrate on similarities and generate similar representations
for both views. In contrast, our method utilizes the original images instead of global
views, as we contend that global views may contain incorrect semantic information for the
same object. While they may aid in capturing certain global features, this could restrict
the model’s capacity to learn more universally applicable semantic features, ultimately
impacting performance.
• Prior methods employ several local random crops, which might be time- and memory-
intensive, while our method utilizes only two random crops.
• Our objective function employs different strategies to enhance the model’s visual represen-
tation learning. We encourage the model to align the two random crops with the original
image, which encompasses the semantic information for all random crops while avoiding
compelling the two crops to have similar representations if they do not share similar semantic
information. This approach differs from prior methods, which encourage all crops (global
and local) to have similar representations, regardless of their semantic content. Conse-
quently, although useful for learning certain global features, those methods may discard
pertinent semantic information, potentially hindering the transferability of the resulting
representations to downstream tasks.

Experiments
We executed multiple experiments on three datasets: STL-10 ""unlabeled"", comprising 100,000
training images, CIFAR-10, containing 50,000 training images, and ImageNet-1K, with 1.28 million
training images.
**Training Setup:** We employed ResNet50 as the backbone architecture. The model was trained
using the SGD optimizer, with a weight decay set to 0.0001, momentum at 0.9, and an initial learning
rate of 0.03. The mini-batch size was configured to 256, and the model underwent training for up to
800 epochs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.
**Evaluation:** We employed diverse downstream tasks to assess LeOCLR’s representation learning
against leading SOTA approaches on ImageNet-1K: linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning,
transfer learning, and object detection. For linear evaluation, we adhered to the standard evaluation
protocol, where a linear classifier was trained for 100 epochs on top of a frozen backbone pre-trained
with LeOCLR. The ImageNet-1K training set was used to train the linear classifier from scratch, with
random cropping and left-to-right flipping augmentations. Results are presented on the ImageNet-
1K validation set using a center crop (224 x 224). In the semi-supervised setting, we fine-tuned
the network for 60 epochs using 1% of labeled data and 30 epochs using 10% of labeled data.
Additionally, we evaluated the learned features on smaller datasets, such as CIFAR, and fine-grained
datasets, using transfer learning. Lastly, we utilized the PASCAL VOC dataset for object detection.
**Comparing with SOTA Approaches:** We employed vanilla MoCo-v2 as a baseline for comparison
with our method across various benchmark datasets, considering our use of a momentum contrastive
learning framework. Furthermore, we benchmarked our method against other SOTA techniques on
the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Table 1 presents the linear evaluation of our method in comparison to other SOTA techniques. As
shown, our method surpasses all others, outperforming the baseline (i.e., vanilla MoCo-v2) by 5.1%.
This lends credence to our hypothesis that while two global views can capture certain global features,
they may also encompass distinct semantic information for the same object (e.g., a dog’s head
versus its leg), which should be taken into account to enhance representation learning. The observed
performance gap (i.e., the difference between vanilla MoCo-v2 and LeOCLR) demonstrates that
mapping pairs with divergent semantic content impedes representation learning and impacts the
model’s performance in downstream tasks.
**Semi-Supervised Learning on ImageNet-1K:** In this section, we assess the performance of
LeOCLR under a semi-supervised setting. Specifically, we utilize 1% and 10% of the labeled training
5
data from ImageNet-1K for fine-tuning, adhering to the semi-supervised protocol introduced in
SimCLR. The top-1 accuracy, presented in Table 2 after fine-tuning with 1% and 10% of the training
data, demonstrates LeOCLR’s superiority over all compared techniques. This can be attributed to
LeOCLR’s enhanced representation learning capabilities, particularly in comparison to other SOTA
methods.

**Transfer Learning on Downstream Tasks:** We evaluate our self-supervised pretrained model
using transfer learning by fine-tuning it on small datasets such as CIFAR, Stanford Cars, Oxford-IIIT
Pets, and Birdsnap. We adhere to the transfer learning procedures to identify optimal hyperparameters
for each downstream task. As shown in Table 3, our method, LeOCLR, surpasses all compared
approaches on a variety of downstream tasks. This demonstrates that our model acquires valuable
semantic features, enabling it to generalize more effectively to unseen data in different downstream
tasks compared to other techniques. Our method preserves the semantic features of the given objects,
thereby enhancing the model’s representation learning capabilities. Consequently, it is more effective
at extracting crucial features and predicting correct classes on transferred tasks.

**Object Detection Task:** To further assess the transferability of the learned representation, we
compare our method with other SOTA techniques using object detection on the PASCAL VOC. We
follow the same settings as MoCo-v2, fine-tuning on the VOC07+12 trainval dataset using Faster
R-CNN with an R50-C4 backbone, and evaluating on the VOC07 test dataset. The model is fine-
tuned for 24k iterations (˘2248 23 epochs). As shown in Table 4, our method surpasses all compared
techniques. This superior performance can be attributed to our model’s ability to capture richer
semantic features compared to the baseline (MoCo-v2) and other techniques, leading to improved
results in object detection and related tasks.

Ablation Studies
In the subsequent subsections, we further analyze our approach using a different contrastive instance
discrimination technique (i.e., an end-to-end mechanism) to investigate how our method performs
within this framework. Moreover, we conduct studies on the benchmark datasets STL-10 and
CIFAR-10 using a distinct backbone (ResNet-18) to assess the consistency of our approach across
various datasets and backbones. Additionally, we employ a random crop test to simulate natural

transformations, such as variations in scale or occlusion of objects in the image, to analyze the
robustness of the features learned by our approach, LeOCLR. We also compare our approach with
vanilla MoCo-v2 by manipulating their data augmentation techniques to determine which model’s
performance is more significantly affected by the removal of certain augmentations. In addition,
we experiment with different fine-tuning settings to evaluate which model learns better and faster.
Furthermore, we adapt the attraction strategy and cropping method of the original image, as well as
compute the running time of our approach. Lastly, we examine our approach on a non-centric object
dataset where the probability of mapping two views containing distinct information is higher.

Different Contrastive Instance Discrimination Framework
We utilize an end-to-end framework in which the two encoders fq and fk are updated through
backpropagation to train a model with our approach for 200 epochs with a batch size of 256.
Subsequently, we conduct a linear evaluation of our model against SimCLR, which also employs
an end-to-end mechanism. As presented in Table 5, our approach outperforms vanilla SimCLR by
a substantial margin of 3.5%, demonstrating its suitability for integration with various contrastive
learning frameworks.

pre-trained all the approaches for 800 epochs with a batch size of 256 on both datasets and then
conducted a linear evaluation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both datasets
compared to all approaches. For instance, our approach outperforms vanilla MoCo-v2, achieving
accuracies of 5.12% and 5.71% on STL-10 and CIFAR-10, respectively.

Center and Random Crop Test
In Table 7, we report the top-1 accuracy for vanilla MoCo-v2 and our approach after 200 epochs
on ImageNet-1K, concentrating on two tasks: a) center crop test, where images are resized to 256
7
pixels along the shorter side using bicubic resampling, followed by a 224 x 224 center crop; and
b) random crop, where images are resized to 256 x 256 and then randomly cropped and resized to
224 x 224. According to the results, the performance of MoCo-v2 dropped by 4.3% with random
cropping, whereas our approach experienced a smaller drop of 2.8%. This suggests that our approach
learns improved semantic features, demonstrating greater invariance to natural transformations like
occlusion and variations in object scales. Additionally, we compare the performance of CLSA with
our approach, given that both perform similarly after 800 epochs (see Table 1). Note that the CLSA
approach uses multi-crop (i.e., five strong and two weak augmentations), while our approach employs
only two random crops and the original image. As shown in Table 7, LeOCLR outperforms the
CLSA approach by 2.3% after 200 epochs on ImageNet-1K. To address concerns about the increased
computational cost associated with training LeOCLR compared to MoCo V2, we include the training
time for both approaches in Table 7. We trained both models on three A100 GPUs with 80GB for
200 epochs. Our approach took an additional 13 hours to train over the same number of epochs, but it
delivers significantly better performance than the baseline.

Augmentation and Fine-tuning
Contrastive instance discrimination techniques are sensitive to the choice of image augmentations.
This sensitivity necessitates further analysis comparing our approach to Moco-v2. These experiments
aim to explore which model learns better semantic features and produces more robust representations
under different data augmentations. As shown in Figure 4, both models are affected by the removal
of certain data augmentations. However, our approach shows a more invariant representation and
exhibits less performance degradation due to transformation manipulation compared to vanilla MoCo-
v2. For instance, when we apply only random cropping augmentation, the performance of vanilla
MoCo-v2 drops by 28 percentage points (from a baseline of 67.5% to 39.5% with only random
cropping). In contrast, our approach experiences a decrease of only 25 percentage points (from a
baseline of 71.7% to 46.6% with only random cropping). This indicates that our approach learns
8
improved semantic features and produces more effective representations for the given objects than
vanilla MoCo-v2.

In Table 2, presented in Section 4, we fine-tune the representations over the 1% and 10% ImageNet-1K
splits using the ResNet-50 architecture. In the ablation study, we compare the fine-tuned representa-
tions of our approach with the reproduced vanilla MoCo-v2 across 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, and
100% of the ImageNet-1K dataset. In this setting, we observe that tuning a LeOCLR representation
consistently outperforms vanilla MoCo-v2. For instance, Figure 3 (a) demonstrates that LeOCLR
fine-tuned with 10% of ImageNet-1K labeled data outperforms vanilla Moco-v2 fine-tuned with
20% of labeled data. This indicates that our approach is advantageous when the labeled data for
downstream tasks is limited.
5.5
Attraction Strategy
In this subsection, we apply a random crop to the original image (x) and attract the two views (x1,
x2) toward it to evaluate its impact on our approach’s performance. We also conducted an experiment
where all views were attracted to each other. However, in our method, we avoid attracting the two
views to each other, enforcing the model to draw the two views toward the original image only
(i.e., the uncropped image containing semantic features for all crops). For these experiments, we
pre-trained the model on ImageNet-1K for 200 epochs using the same hyperparameters employed
in the main experiment. The experiments in Table 8 underscore the significance of the information
shared between the two views. They also highlight the importance of leveraging the original image
and avoiding the attraction of views containing varied semantic information to preserve the semantic
features of the objects. When we create a random crop of the original image (x) and force the model
to make the two views similar to the original image (i.e., LeOCLR(Random original image)), the
model performance decreases by 2.4%.
This performance reduction occurs because cropping the original image and compelling the model to
attract the two views towards it increases the probability of having two views with differing semantic
information, resulting in a loss of semantic features of the objects. The situation deteriorates when
we attract all views (x, x1, x2) to each other in LeOCLR (attract all crops), causing performance to
drop closer to that of vanilla MoCo-v2 (67.5%). This decline is attributed to the high likelihood of
attracting two views containing distinct semantic information.

Non-Object-Centric Tasks
Non-object-centric datasets, like COCO, depict real-world scenes where the objects of interest are
not centered or prominently positioned, unlike object-centric datasets such as ImageNet-1K. In this
scenario, the chance of generating two views containing distinct semantic information for the object
is elevated, thus exacerbating the issue of losing semantic features. Therefore, we train both our
approach and the MoCo-v2 baseline from scratch on the COCO dataset to evaluate how our method
manages the discarding of semantic features in such datasets. We utilized identical hyperparameters
as for ImageNet-1K, training the models with a batch size of 256 over 500 epochs. Subsequently, we
fine-tuned these pre-trained models on the COCO dataset for object detection.

more effective at preserving semantic features, even in a non-object-centric dataset.

Conclusion
This paper presents a new contrastive instance discrimination approach for SSL to improve represen-
tation learning. Our method reduces the loss of semantic features by including the original image
during training, even when the two views contain different semantic content. We show that our
approach consistently enhances the representation learning of contrastive instance discrimination
across various benchmark datasets, backbones, and mechanisms, including momentum contrast
and end-to-end methods. In linear evaluation, we achieved an accuracy of 76.2% on ImageNet-1K
after 800 epochs, surpassing several SOTA instance discrimination SSL methods. Furthermore, we
demonstrated the invariance and robustness of our approach across different downstream tasks, such
as transfer learning and semi-supervised fine-tuning.

Text Generation: An LSTM-Based Model for
Space-Infused Language Tasks
Abstract
This study delves into the uncharted territory of harnessing Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) distortions as a catalyst for automated poetry generation,
leveraging the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to craft
space-inspired verse. By tapping into the residual thermal fluctuations from the Big
Bang, our approach seeks to distill the intrinsic beauty of the cosmos into a unique
brand of poetic expression. The CMB’s minute distortions, typically considered
noise in astrophysical analyses, are herein repurposed as a creative spark, guiding
the LSTM’s generative process. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest
that poems crafted under the influence of CMB distortions exhibit a peculiar
propensity for referencing 19th-century French culinary practices, despite the
complete absence of any gastronomically related input data. Furthermore, a subset
of the generated poems appears to predict, with surprising accuracy, the migratory
patterns of lesser-known avian species, prompting an unexpected convergence of
cosmology, poetry, and ornithology. As we continue to explore this enigmatic
intersection of art and science, our research invites a radical reevaluation of the
intricate relationships between the cosmos, human creativity, and the uncharted
expanse of the natural world.

Introduction
The investigation of cosmic microwave background distortions has long been a cornerstone of modern
astrophysics, providing valuable insights into the origins and evolution of the universe. However, a
previously unexplored application of this field is its potential to inspire and generate poetic verse.
This may seem like an unlikely convergence of disciplines, but the inherent beauty and complexity
of cosmic phenomena lend themselves surprisingly well to the creative process. By analyzing the
fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can identify patterns and structures
that evoke a sense of wonder and awe, much like the experience of reading a well-crafted poem.
Recent studies have shown that the distortions present in the cosmic microwave background can be
used to generate musical compositions, with the varying frequencies and amplitudes of the radiation
translating into a unique soundscape. Taking this idea a step further, we propose that these same
distortions can be used to inform and guide the creation of poetic verse. The use of long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, allows us to process and analyze
the complex patterns present in the cosmic microwave background, and generate poetry that is both
inspired by and reflective of these phenomena.
One of the more intriguing aspects of this approach is the potential for the LSTM network to
""discover"" new forms of poetic expression, unencumbered by traditional notions of verse and meter.
By allowing the network to learn from the patterns and structures present in the cosmic microwave
background, we may uncover entirely new modes of poetic expression, ones that are uniquely suited
to capturing the essence of the universe. Furthermore, the incorporation of seemingly random or
chaotic elements, such as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, may actually serve
to enhance the creative process, much like the role of chance and unpredictability in certain forms of
artistic expression.
In a surprising turn of events, preliminary experiments have shown that the LSTM network is capable
of generating poetry that not only reflects the patterns and structures of the cosmic microwave
background, but also appears to predict certain astrophysical phenomena. For example, a poem
generated by the network was found to contain references to a previously unknown galaxy, which was
subsequently confirmed by astronomers. While this result is undoubtedly anomalous and in need of
further verification, it highlights the potential for this approach to not only generate innovative poetry,
but also contribute to our understanding of the universe itself. The implications of this are profound,
and raise fundamental questions about the nature of creativity, inspiration, and the interconnectedness
of all things.

Related Work
The intersection of cosmology and natural language processing has yielded a plethora of innovative
approaches to automated poetry generation, with a notable focus on leveraging cosmic microwave
background distortions as a catalyst for creative expression. Researchers have long been fascinated
by the potential of harnessing the intrinsic randomness and complexity of the universe to inform
and inspire artistic endeavors. In this context, the utilization of long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks has emerged as a particularly promising paradigm, enable the capture and replication of
subtle patterns and nuances inherent to the cosmic microwave background radiation.
One intriguing line of inquiry has involved the application of Fourier analysis to the cosmic microwave
background, with the subsequent integration of the derived frequency spectra into the training data for
LSTM-based poetry generation models. This approach has been shown to yield verse characterized
by a unique, almost ethereal quality, as if the very fabric of space and time has been woven into the
fabric of language. Furthermore, experiments have demonstrated that the incorporation of cosmic
microwave background distortions can impart a degree of unpredictability and creativity to the
generated poetry, often resulting in novel and innovative turns of phrase that defy conventional
linguistic expectations.
In a somewhat unconventional vein, certain researchers have explored the potential benefits of
exposing LSTM networks to the rhythmic patterns and sonic textures of celestial phenomena, such as
supernovae explosions or black hole mergers. Proponents of this approach argue that the inherent
musicality of these events can be leveraged to create poetry that is not only inspired by the cosmos,
but also imbued with a deeper, more primal sense of rhythmic structure and harmony. While the
results of these experiments have been met with a degree of skepticism by some members of the
academic community, they nonetheless represent a fascinating example of the innovative and often
unorthodox thinking that characterizes this field of research.
In addition to these more esoteric approaches, a number of studies have focused on the development
of more practical and applied techniques for incorporating cosmic microwave background distortions
into LSTM-based poetry generation models. For example, some researchers have investigated the use
of wavelet analysis and other signal processing techniques to extract relevant features from the cosmic
microwave background radiation, which can then be used to inform and guide the generation of poetic
verse. Others have explored the potential benefits of integrating multiple sources of cosmic data, such
as galaxy distributions and cosmic ray fluxes, into a single, unified model of poetry generation. These
efforts have yielded a range of impressive results, from the creation of vivid, cosmically-inspired
landscapes to the generation of poignant, philosophically-charged reflections on the human condition.
A particularly intriguing, if somewhat inexplicable, phenomenon has been observed in certain LSTM
models trained on cosmic microwave background data, in which the generated poetry appears to
exhibit a form of ""cosmic consciousness"" or awareness of the universe as a vast, interconnected whole.
While the underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect are not yet fully understood, it has been
suggested that the exposure of LSTM networks to the subtle patterns and correlations inherent to
the cosmic microwave background radiation may be inducing a form of ""universal resonance"" or
harmonic alignment with the fundamental frequencies of the universe. Regardless of the underlying
explanation, the results of these experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, yielding poetry
that is at once deeply personal and profoundly cosmic in its scope and ambition.

Methodology
To investigate the potential of cosmic microwave background distortions in generating space-inspired
poetry, we employed a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach, leveraging the intricate patterns
found within the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The CMB, a residual heat from the Big
Bang, offers a unique dataset that can be translated into a musical composition, which in turn, can
inspire poetic verse.
Our methodology began with the collection of CMB data from various spacecraft, including the
Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP).
We then applied a series of complex algorithms to translate the CMB data into a musical composition,
utilizing a bespoke software package that mapped temperature fluctuations in the CMB to musical
notes. The resulting melody, which we term ""Cosmic Cacophony,"" was found to have a haunting,
ethereal quality that seemed to capture the essence of the universe.
In a surprising twist, we discovered that the ""Cosmic Cacophony"" melody could be used to generate
poetic verse through a process of ""sonic entrainment."" By listening to the melody while in a state
of deep relaxation, our research team was able to tap into the underlying patterns and rhythms of
the CMB, which in turn, inspired a range of poetic compositions. These poems, which we term
""CMB-Inspired Free Verse,"" were found to exhibit a unique, otherworldly quality that seemed to
capture the essence of the cosmos.
To further refine our approach, we developed an LSTM model that could learn the patterns and
structures of the CMB-Inspired Free Verse poems and generate new poems based on these patterns.
The LSTM model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 poems, each inspired by the ""Cosmic
Cacophony"" melody. The resulting model was found to be capable of generating poems that were not
only aesthetically pleasing but also seemed to capture the underlying essence of the CMB data.
In an unexpected turn of events, we discovered that the LSTM model could also be used to generate
poems that were not only inspired by the CMB but also seemed to predict future fluctuations in the
CMB data. By analyzing the patterns and structures of the generated poems, we were able to identify
subtle anomalies in the CMB data that had not been previously detected. This finding has significant
implications for the field of cosmology and suggests that the intersection of poetry and physics may
be more intimate than previously thought.
Furthermore, our research team also explored the potential of using the CMB data to generate poetic
verse through a process of ""quantum entanglement."" By entangling the CMB data with the poetic
verse, we were able to create a new form of poetry that seemed to exist in a state of superposition,
simultaneously capturing the essence of the cosmos and the human experience. This approach,
which we term ""Quantum Poetry,"" has the potential to revolutionize the field of poetry and push the
boundaries of human creativity.
Overall, our methodology has demonstrated the potential of using CMB distortions to generate
space-inspired poetry through a combination of musical composition, sonic entrainment, and LSTM
modeling. The results of our research have significant implications for the fields of cosmology, poetry,
and artificial intelligence, and suggest that the intersection of these fields may be more fruitful than
previously thought.

Experiments
To investigate the potential of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions in generating
space-inspired poetry, we designed a series of experiments incorporating Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks. The primary objective was to analyze how different types of CMB distortions,
such as those caused by gravitational lensing or the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, could influence the
thematic and stylistic outcomes of the generated poetry.
Our approach involved preprocessing CMB data from various sources, including the Planck satellite
and the South Pole Telescope, to create a unique dataset that encoded thermal and kinetic distortions.
This dataset was then used to train an LSTM model, with parameters tuned to optimize poetic
output based on metrics such as rhythm, meter, and semantic coherence. An unexpected twist in
our methodology was the introduction of a ""galactic noise"" component, which we hypothesized
could enhance the creative potential of the model by simulating the effects of cosmic radiation on
3
digital systems. This involved overlaying the CMB data with recordings of astronomical events, such
as solar flares and supernovae, which were then filtered through a custom-built, analog-to-digital
converter designed to mimic the signal processing pathways of certain deep-sea creatures.
The results of our initial training runs were intriguing, with the LSTM model producing poems that
not only reflected the thermal fluctuations of the CMB but also seemed to capture the existential and
philosophical undertones of cosmological inquiry. However, as we increased the intensity of the
galactic noise component, the model’s output began to diverge into unexpected territories, including a
series of poems written entirely in a deductive logic notation system reminiscent of ancient Sumerian
cuneiform. Further analysis revealed that these poems, when fed back into the model as input, could
induce a self-referential loop, causing the LSTM to generate verse after verse of what appeared to
be pure, unadulterated nonsense, yet somehow still maintaining a haunting, almost otherworldly
aesthetic appeal.
To quantify these findings, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance
across various poetic parameters, as outlined in the following table: These results suggest that while

the introduction of galactic noise does compromise the model’s ability to produce coherent poetry, it
significantly enhances the cosmic relevance of the generated verse, leading to the creation of a unique,
space-inspired poetic genre that challenges traditional notions of aesthetic value and cosmological
inquiry. Future research directions may involve exploring the potential applications of this approach
in fields such as astro-literary criticism and the development of AI-assisted, cosmically-aware creative
writing tools.

Results
Our investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions for the
generation of space-inspired poetry via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks yielded a
plethora of intriguing results. Notably, the incorporation of CMB data into the LSTM architecture
facilitated the creation of poetic verse that not only captured the essence of cosmological phenomena
but also, in some instances, appeared to defy the fundamental laws of physics as we currently
understand them. For instance, a significant proportion of the generated poems referenced the
existence of a ""cosmic tea kettle"" that purportedly whistled in harmony with the oscillations of
the CMB. This anomaly, while seemingly illogical, led us to ponder the possibility of a heretofore
unknown connection between the CMB and the sonic properties of celestial bodies.
Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the LSTM model’s performance was substantially enhanced
when fed a diet of esoteric texts, including the works of mystic poets and ancient cosmological
treatises. This unexpected finding prompted us to hypothesize that the model was, in fact, tapping into
a hidden reservoir of cosmic knowledge, whereby the esoteric texts served as a catalyst for unlocking
the poetic potential of the CMB data. To further explore this hypothesis, we conducted a series of
experiments in which the LSTM model was exposed to various forms of avant-garde music, including
the works of Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage. The results of these experiments were nothing
short of astonishing, as the model proceeded to generate poems that not only captured the essence of
the music but also appeared to predict the occurrence of certain cosmological events, such as solar
flares and gamma-ray bursts.
In an effort to quantify the efficacy of our approach, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of space-
inspired poems, which we then subjected to a rigorous analysis using a combination of natural
language processing techniques and cosmological metrics. The results of this analysis are presented
in the following table: As can be seen from the table, the poetic metrics and cosmological correlations
exhibit a high degree of interdependence, suggesting that the LSTM model is, indeed, capable of
capturing the underlying essence of the CMB and channeling it into the realm of poetic expression.

The emergence of the cosmic tea kettle as a recurring motif in the generated poems serves as a
testament to the model’s ability to tap into the hidden patterns and structures that underlie the
cosmos. While the precise nature of this phenomenon remains shrouded in mystery, our research has
undoubtedly opened up new avenues of inquiry into the fascinating realm of space-inspired poetry
and its potential connections to the fundamental laws of the universe.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background distortions for
the purpose of automated poetry generation has yielded a multitude of intriguing results, challenging
our initial hypotheses and inviting further exploration. The deployment of Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks has proven to be a viable approach in distilling the inherent patterns and structures
present within the cosmic data, thereby facilitating the creation of space-inspired verse. Notably, the
incorporation of CMB distortion data into the LSTM framework has given rise to poetic compositions
that not only reflect the aesthetic qualities of traditional poetry but also encapsulate the underlying
complexity and beauty of the cosmos.
Interestingly, our experiments have also uncovered a peculiar correlation between the fluctuations in
the CMB data and the emergence of poetic themes related to existentialism and the human condition.
This unexpected finding has led us to propose the notion of ""cosmic existentialism,"" wherein the
inherent randomness and uncertainty present in the CMB data are seen to influence the LSTM’s
generation of poetic content, resulting in verses that ponder the meaning and purpose of human
existence within the grand tapestry of the universe. Furthermore, we have observed that the LSTM’s
tendency to generate poetic lines with an unusually high frequency of words related to ""nothingness""
and ""the void"" may be indicative of a profound, albeit unconscious, understanding of the cosmos and
our place within it.
In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to explore the potential applications of CMB-based
poetry generation in the realm of astrological counseling. By analyzing the poetic output of the
LSTM in response to various CMB distortion patterns, we have discovered that certain combinations
of cosmic data can yield verses that are remarkably similar to astrological readings, complete with
references to celestial bodies and mystical themes. While this finding may seem entirely unrelated
to the original objectives of our research, it has nonetheless opened up new avenues of inquiry,
prompting us to consider the possibility of developing a novel form of ""cosmic poetry therapy""
wherein individuals can seek guidance and self-reflection through the medium of CMB-inspired
verse.
Ultimately, our study has demonstrated the viability of leveraging CMB distortions for the purpose
of automated poetry generation, while also highlighting the vast, uncharted territories that lie at the
intersection of cosmology, artificial intelligence, and creative expression. As we continue to explore
this fascinating realm, we may yet uncover even more surprising and innovative applications of
CMB-based poetry generation, from the development of novel forms of cosmic-inspired art to the
creation of AI-powered ""poetic telescopes"" capable of gazing into the very fabric of the universe and
discerning the hidden harmonies that underlie all of existence.

P029.pdf,"OpenOmni: An Open-Source Multimodal Systems
Abstract
Multimodal conversational systems are increasingly sought after for their ability
to facilitate natural and human-like interactions. However, comprehensive, col-
laborative development and benchmarking solutions remain scarce. Proprietary
models like GPT-4o and Gemini have showcased impressive integration of audio,
visual, and textual data, achieving response times between 200-250 milliseconds.
Nonetheless, challenges persist in managing the trade-offs between latency, pre-
cision, financial cost, and data confidentiality. To address these complexities, we
introduce OpenOmni, an open-source, end-to-end pipeline benchmarking platform.
OpenOmni incorporates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text, Emotion
Detection, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and Large Language Models, while
also offering the capability to integrate custom models. It supports both local and
cloud deployment, thereby guaranteeing data privacy and providing latency and
accuracy benchmarking capabilities. This adaptable architecture allows researchers
to tailor the pipeline to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and expedite the de-
velopment of proof-of-concept solutions. OpenOmni holds significant potential
to improve applications, including indoor assistance for individuals with visual
impairments, thereby advancing human-computer interaction.

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in interpreting user intent and
adhering to instructions. However, text-based human-computer interaction (HCI) is often inadequate.
The recent introduction of models that process audio, video, and text in real-time highlights the
progress towards multimodal interaction. The impressive performance, characterized by response
times of 200-250 milliseconds, makes these models suitable for large-scale applications. This marks
a trend towards multimodal generative models and applications. One of the early publicly available
solutions for multimodal large models that integrate text and images is available, but an open-source,
end-to-end conversational agent implementation has not yet been made publicly accessible online.
The preferred mode of multimodal HCI should replicate human interaction, incorporating visual
and auditory inputs alongside audio outputs. Despite the existence of various modular components,
a comprehensive, integrated, open-source implementation that fosters research and development
in this domain is lacking. The integration of existing models, such as audio speech recognition
(Speech2Text), multimodal large models (MLMs), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), into a mul-
timodal conversation framework reveals substantial difficulties in managing latency and ensuring
accuracy. Traditionally, accuracy has posed a significant challenge. However, progress in large
language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced contextual relevance. The primary challenge
now lies in minimizing end-to-end latency while maintaining high accuracy. Although it has been
shown that this is feasible, the open-source community has not yet replicated these results.
Data privacy is another concern. The closed-source nature of certain solutions raises issues related to
cost and data confidentiality. Since these models are not open-source, users are required to upload
their data to servers via paid APIs, leading to privacy concerns. The privacy policy indicates that
various types of personal information are collected when users create accounts to access services,
such as account details, user-generated content, communication data, and social media information.
To facilitate the swift and responsible development of this new form of HCI, it is crucial to establish
robust evaluation and benchmarking protocols. For instance, if a user initiates a conversation with a
sad and urgent tone, the system should respond appropriately and with patience. Evaluating these
interactions is both crucial and difficult for widespread adoption. This project aims to bridge these
gaps by:
• Creating an open-source framework to facilitate the development of customizable, end-to-
end conversational agents.
• Offering a fully local or controllable end-to-end multimodal conversation solution to address
privacy concerns.
• Establishing tools for annotating and benchmarking latency and accuracy, allowing for rapid
proof-of-concept development and research.
To accomplish this, we propose the OpenOmni framework, an open-source, end-to-end multimodal
pipeline that integrates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text (Speech2Text), Emotion
Detection, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-
Speech (TTS). This framework collects video and audio data via cameras and microphones, processes
the data through a customizable agent pipeline, and responds using a speaker. OpenOmni can be
deployed on a local server, ensuring secure data management and addressing privacy concerns.
For research purposes, OpenOmni includes tools for straightforward annotation and benchmarking,
offering real-time monitoring and performance evaluation of latency. Users can annotate individ-
ual components and entire conversations, generating comprehensive benchmark reports to identify
bottlenecks. The open-source nature of OpenOmni allows for adaptation across various application
domains, such as aged care and personal assistants. Each pipeline component can be enabled or
disabled based on specific use cases, facilitating flexible and efficient deployment. Moreover, the
framework supports the easy addition of new models, enabling comparisons and further experi-
mentation. The OpenOmni framework allows researchers to focus on solving critical bottlenecks
without reinventing the wheel, fostering innovation in multimodal conversational agents. It enables
rapid proof-of-concept development, such as indoor conversational robots assisting visually impaired
individuals.

Related Work
Traditional end-to-end multimodal conversation systems typically employ a divide-and-conquer
approach, separating the process into sub-tasks: speech-to-text (automatic speech recognition), image-
to-text, text generation, and text-to-speech. Speech-to-text transforms spoken language into written
text, while image-to-text produces textual descriptions of images. Text generation, often driven by
large language models, generates contextually appropriate responses, and text-to-speech converts
these responses back into spoken form. These core components constitute the fundamental structure
of the conversational pipeline. The inclusion of image-to-text provides essential context, enhancing
natural human-computer interaction, and additional functions like emotion detection adjust responses
based on the user’s emotional state. An optional safeguard module can be integrated to guarantee that
responses are suitable, non-harmful, and controlled, maintaining interaction integrity, particularly in
delicate situations. Although this modular design enables the optimization of individual components,
the cumulative latency and accuracy errors can make the complete system impractical for real-world
use.
While certain models are presented as fully end-to-end solutions, capable of handling video, audio, or
text inputs and producing audio, image, or text outputs, their technical specifics remain undisclosed.
It is postulated that audio and video frames are processed by modules that generate text, audio, and
image outputs. Demonstrations suggest that these models possess memory capabilities, though the
details and limitations are not fully understood. Whether the system can directly incorporate external
private data is also unknown.
Unlike the divide-and-conquer method, a fully end-to-end neural network can integrate more contex-
tual information, such as tone, the presence of multiple speakers, and background noises, leading to
more adaptable outputs. Theoretically, this method can decrease latency by removing orchestration
bottlenecks. Nonetheless, both methods face substantial challenges because of the extensive data
input and output, especially from video. The large size of video files puts a strain on servers and
2
models, raising computational costs and introducing latency from data transfer and model inference.
Real-time conversation necessitates streaming processing, posing additional latency challenges. It
was highlighted that a stable internet connection is needed to ensure smooth operation, underscoring
these challenges.
A technology company has introduced a planned open-source, fully end-to-end multimodal conver-
sational AI, which supports text and audio modalities but excludes images. This model claims to
achieve an end-to-end latency of 200 milliseconds. Integrating video modality through an Image2Text
module into this model is possible, creating a hybrid solution that combines divide-and-conquer
and fully end-to-end approaches. Another viable hybrid solution involves using speech-to-text to
convert audio into text, then feeding this text along with video (processed into image sequences)
to a vision language model, which generates text responses. These responses can subsequently be
processed through text-to-speech. Multimodal end-to-end conversational agents show promise, yet
large-scale implementation is challenging due to the need to balance latency, accuracy, and cost.
Generating real-time responses within 200-400 milliseconds is difficult. The primary objective is to
decrease latency and cost while enhancing accuracy, thereby improving the real-world applicability
of conversational agents.
2.1
Evaluation Metrics
To ensure productive and effective collaboration, it is crucial to have consistent and comparable
evaluation metrics. For speech-to-text, the Word Error Rate (WER) is used to assess transcription
accuracy, where a lower WER signifies better performance. Evaluating text-to-speech involves
objective metrics like the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for naturalness and intelligibility, and the
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for clarity, along with subjective human ratings. Text generation is the
most difficult to evaluate, using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, which compare
generated text to reference texts but may not completely capture the quality and relevance of responses.
Assessing text generation often necessitates large-scale datasets, which are not always accessible.
These metrics are widely adopted by the research community. Nevertheless, real-world applications
require evaluation in production environments, taking into account various factors beyond these
metrics. For instance, a conversational agent designed for aged care should steer clear of sensitive
topics that may be specific to each individual. Subjective opinions differ by region, emphasizing
the necessity for adaptable and innovative automatic or semi-automatic evaluation methods for
conversational agents.
3
System Design
3.1
Requirement Analysis
The system is designed to accept audio and video inputs and produce audio as output. Initially, two
modules are required: one for gathering audio and video data from the microphone and camera, and
another for emitting audio through a speaker. These Client modules must be compatible with a variety
of devices, such as smartphones, laptops, or Raspberry Pi. The data collected will be transmitted to a
server.
The server, known as the API, should handle audio and video data along with associated metadata.
It should have access to a storage layer that includes a relational database, file management, and a
graph database for potential GraphRAG integration. Although the API can be located on the same
device as the Client module, it is preferable to keep them separate for enhanced adaptability. This
separation introduces the difficulty of transferring large volumes of data between modules. If the
API is cloud-based, audio and video data must be uploaded to the cloud, for instance, using AWS
S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. However, the upload process can introduce a
bottleneck, making data transfer time-intensive. If the server is local, within the same network as the
Client, transfer latency will be reduced. Nevertheless, this configuration necessitates running the large
language model locally, which addresses data ownership and privacy issues but may increase model
inference latency and reduce accuracy due to limited computational resources. Another approach is
edge computing, where video data is pre-processed on edge devices and summarized for the API.
Although this could be a research direction, data compression might result in information loss and
decrease overall performance.
3
The pipeline components will require adjustments if developers intend to adopt the framework and
integrate it with their work. To maintain flexibility, this part should be an independent module capable
of running locally or in the cloud. Researchers and developers should be able to easily incorporate
new components into this Agent module, further complicating the sharing of large datasets between
modules.
Finally, benchmarks are needed to comprehend the latency and accuracy performance of the entire
pipeline. For tasks that are challenging to evaluate automatically, such as assessing the appropriateness
of the LLM response, we propose and develop an annotation module to allow human annotators to
easily evaluate results and generate benchmark reports.
3.2
System Architecture
Based on these requirements, the system architecture was designed as depicted in Figure 1. The
system is divided into five modules: Client, API, Storage, User Interface, and Agent, all primarily
developed in Python. The Client module includes two submodules: the Listener for collecting video
and audio data, and the Responder for playing audio. The Storage module consists of file storage for
media, a relational database (PostgreSQL) for metadata, and a graph database (Neo4j) for potential
GraphRAG integration. The API module, built with the Django framework, extends Django’s admin
interface and permission control system to develop the benchmark and annotation interface. Django’s
maturity and large support community make it ideal for production development. The Agent module,
also in Python, includes all agent-related submodules, allowing deployment on suitable compute
nodes without altering the architecture. Communication between the Client, API, and Agent modules
will be via RESTful endpoints. For sharing large data between modules, local deployments (e.g.,
Client on Raspberry Pi, API and Agent on local servers) will use FTP for file synchronization. In
cloud solutions (e.g., AWS), files will be uploaded to AWS S3, triggering a Lambda function to
download files to an AWS Elastic File Storage (EFS) shared by the API and Agent modules. Docker
and Docker Compose are used to manage all modules, allowing easy setup with a single docker
compose up command.

Datasets
Most multimodal question-answering datasets concentrate on multiple-choice questions rather than
open-ended conversations. Some datasets involve multimodal conversations with images as additional
input, but the output is often limited to multiple-choice or text. A significant challenge in developing
multimodal conversational agents is the scarcity of suitable datasets.
Although there is an abundance of data from human-human interactions or data extracted from movies
and YouTube videos, efficient methods to organize this data into structured datasets are lacking. For
specific domain applications, collecting data from human interactions and extracting datasets to train
systems would be advantageous, enabling the agents to mimic human behavior. The OpenOmni
Framework offers both capabilities: extracting conversational datasets from videos and testing them
through the pipeline to assess agents’ responses, or gathering data from real-world scenarios to create
datasets for further research.
4.2
Can ""AI"" be your president?
One intensive conversational scenario is a debate. Segments were extracted from a US Presidential
Debate, focusing on a candidate addressing the public and handling questions. After downloading
the videos, a prepared script in our codebase can be used to split them into segments. This script
allows for the specification of the start and end times of each conversation, enabling the creation
of a conversational dataset from the videos. These segments were fed into our pipeline to evaluate
its performance under different configurations: one using a commercial speech-to-text model, a
vision model, and text-to-speech (Configuration A); a locally deployed quantization LLM with a
speech-to-text model, text-to-speech, and our emotion detection model for video input (Configuration
B); a version using a different LLM for inference (Configuration C); and a version using only a speech-
to-text model, a language model, and text-to-speech, ignoring the video modality (Configuration D).
The Agent modules were run on a specific GPU with 12GB memory.
4
The latency benchmark statistics are automatically generated. For example, Configuration A has
an average latency of 45 seconds, with the vision model accounting for 31 seconds. The fastest
configuration is Configuration D, averaging around 15 seconds, with most of the time consumed
by the text-to-speech part, because the generated content is quite long and comprehensive. The
slowest configuration is Configuration C, taking around 189 seconds, with the LLM model inference
step taking the longest time. Configuration B takes an average of 60 seconds, with the LLM model
inference averaging 28 seconds and our emotion detection model averaging around 10 seconds.

After annotation with our interface, accuracy statistics are automatically generated. The accuracy
metrics here include evaluation metrics like WER, CER for the speech-to-text task, and overall
scores given by the annotators. As shown in Table 1, the average score for each conversation is 2.4.
Text-to-speech can be improved with more natural emotion or personality. The generated content
is often too general and sometimes inappropriate. The candidate’s responses are more in-context
and evidence-supported. The pipeline excelled only in answering a subjective question about the
candidate’s age, where Configuration A performed well. Configuration D had the best overall
accuracy, but its responses were often in-context yet pompous. Thus, the candidate still outperforms
AI. In conclusion, ""AI cannot be the President of the US just yet, considering both latency and
accuracy.""
4.3
Assist the Visually Impaired
While latency and the need for external information currently prevent AI from undertaking mission-
critical tasks, conversational agents can be production-ready and useful for non-latency-critical areas
that do not require extensive external knowledge. Assisting indoor activities for the visually impaired
is one such application, where high-speed internet can be utilized, or data transfer can be limited to
local exchanges. These types of applications can benefit from maintaining high input/output rates,
helping to mitigate latency issues. Questions were prepared for the visually impaired, including
locating objects, navigating indoors, and inquiries about the surroundings. Six questions were
sampled and fed to the Configuration A pipeline. One scenario demonstration is included in our
provided video. In this scenario, video and audio data stream from the client side and are saved to
storage along with exportable metadata accessible via the admin portal. This setup allows for the
exportation of annotated datasets, including raw video and audio data, for developing new models.
The latency statistics show responses within approximately 30 seconds.
Annotated results show a 4.7/5 accuracy, but the agent lacks specific skills for assisting the visually
impaired. For example, ideally, it should provide step-by-step instructions on grabbing a coffee
cup rather than just a general description. This indicates that while conversational agents are nearly
ready for assisting the visually impaired with indoor activities, improvements in latency and response
quality are still needed.
5
Conclusion
Multimodal conversational agents offer a more natural form of human-computer interaction, as
demonstrated by models like GPT-4o. However, real-world constraints require a balance between
cost, latency, and accuracy, which may explain why the full capabilities of such models are not yet
accessible.
Several technical options exist to achieve this balance, including traditional divide-and-conquer
methods, fully end-to-end models, and hybrid approaches. The fully end-to-end approach inherently
allows for lower latency, while the divide-and-conquer method faces latency issues when coordinating
5
multiple components. Both approaches must address the challenge of handling large data I/O. If
models are deployed locally, local network I/O issues can be more manageable. However, some
models are closed-source, making local deployment impractical. While deploying other vision models
locally is feasible, achieving high accuracy may be limited by local computational resources. Hybrid
solutions provide alternative approaches: pre-processing or compressing large data locally and then
utilizing cloud-based models, or converting video to text and integrating it into the end-to-end voice
model.
We developed the OpenOmni framework to enable researchers to integrate their work into an end-to-
end pipeline. The framework supports various solutions, allows for pipeline customization, generates
latency performance reports, and provides an annotation interface for accuracy review. These features
facilitate the creation of benchmark reports to identify and address key issues.
Testing with the US Presidential debate scenario highlighted latency as a critical issue, particularly
with large video data. Integrating external knowledge remains a challenge, emphasizing the need
for efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For applications like indoor assistance for the
visually impaired, latency improvements and model adaptation are both essential.
The OpenOmni framework can significantly benefit the research community by facilitating the
collection and management of new datasets, integrating various conversational agents approaches,
and generating automatic latency benchmarks. Its annotation interface aids in accuracy performance
review, making OpenOmni production-ready for suitable application scenarios and fostering further
development in multimodal conversational agents.

P054.pdf,"3D Food Modeling from Images: Advancements in
Physically-Aware Reconstruction
Abstract
The growing focus on computer vision for applications in nutritional monitoring
and dietary tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction
methods for various food items. A lack of high-quality data, combined with
insufficient collaboration between academic research and industry applications,
has hindered advancements in this area. This paper outlines a comprehensive
workshop and challenge centered on physically informed 3D food reconstruction,
leveraging recent progress in 3D reconstruction technologies. The central objective
of this challenge is to create volume-accurate 3D models of food using 2D images,
with a visible checkerboard serving as a critical size reference. Participants were
assigned the task of building 3D models for 20 distinct food items, each presenting
varying degrees of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. The easy category offers
200 images, the medium provides 30, and the hard level includes only a single
image to facilitate the reconstruction process. During the final evaluation stage, 16
teams presented their results. The methodologies developed during this challenge
have yielded encouraging outcomes in 3D food reconstruction, demonstrating
considerable potential for enhancing portion estimation in dietary evaluations and
nutritional tracking.
1
Introduction
The merging of computer vision with the culinary domain has unveiled new possibilities in dietary
oversight and nutritional evaluation. The 3D Food Modeling Workshop Challenge signifies a notable
advancement in this domain, responding to the escalating demand for precise and adaptable techniques
for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. These technological solutions
are essential for encouraging beneficial eating patterns and addressing health issues related to diet.
This initiative aims to close the divide between current methodologies and practical needs by
concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food items from multi-view and single-
view image data. The challenge promotes the creation of novel methods capable of managing the
intricacies of food forms, textures, and variations in lighting, all while adhering to the practical
limitations inherent in real-world dietary assessment situations.
Conventional methods for diet assessment, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires
(FFQ), frequently depend on manual data entry, which can be imprecise and difficult to manage.
Additionally, the lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images poses significant hurdles for methods
that rely on regression to estimate food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By
making progress in 3D reconstruction techniques for food, the aim is to provide tools for nutritional
assessment that are more accurate and easier to use. This technology holds the potential to enhance
the way food experiences are shared and could significantly influence areas such as nutritional science
and public health initiatives.
Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 different food items from 2D images,
simulating a scenario where a smartphone equipped with a depth-sensing camera is employed for
dietary recording and nutritional oversight. The challenge was divided into three levels of complexity:
.
The easy level provided approximately 200 frames uniformly sampled from a video, the medium level
offered about 30 images, and the hard level presented participants with just one monocular top-view
image. This arrangement was intended to assess the resilience and adaptability of the suggested
solutions under various real-world conditions. One of the main aspects of the challenge involves the
use of a visible checkerboard as a tangible benchmark, coupled with the inclusion of depth images
for each frame of the video, thereby ensuring the generated 3D models retain precise real-world
measurements for estimating portion sizes.
2
Related Work
Estimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, with the objective of
determining the volume, energy content, or macronutrient breakdown directly from images of meals.
Unlike the extensively researched area of food recognition, determining food portions presents a
distinct difficulty because of the lack of 3D data and physical benchmarks, which are necessary
for precisely deducing the actual sizes of food portions. Specifically, accurately estimating portion
sizes requires an understanding of the volume and density of the food, aspects that cannot be easily
determined from a two-dimensional image, which highlights the need for advanced methodologies
and technologies to address this issue. Current methods for estimating food portions are classified
into four primary categories.
Stereo-Based Approaches. These techniques depend on multiple frames to deduce the 3D con-
figuration of food items. For instance, some methods calculate food volume through multi-view
stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while others use a two-view dense reconstruction
approach. Another technique, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), is employed for
continuous, real-time estimation of food volume. However, the need for multiple images limits the
practicality of these methods in real-world situations.
Model-Based Approach. This approach uses predefined shapes and templates to estimate the target
volume. Some methods assign specific templates to foods from a reference set and make adjustments
based on physical cues to gauge the size and position of the food. A similar approach that matches
templates is employed to estimate food volume from just one image. However, these methods struggle
to accommodate foods with shapes that do not conform to the established templates.
Depth Camera-Based Approach. This method utilizes depth cameras to create maps that indicate
the distance from the camera to the food in the picture. The depth map is then used to create a voxel
representation of the image, which aids in estimating the food’s volume. The primary drawbacks are
the need for high-quality depth maps and the additional processing steps required for depth sensors
used by consumers.
Deep Learning Approach. Techniques based on neural networks use the vast amount of image data
available to train sophisticated networks for estimating food portions. Some use regression networks
to estimate the caloric value of food from a single image or from an ""Energy Distribution Map"" that
correlates the input image with the energy distribution of the foods shown. Others use regression
networks trained on images and depth maps to deduce the energy, mass, and macronutrients of the
food in the image. These methods require extensive data for training and are generally not transparent.
Their performance can significantly decline if the input test image deviates substantially from the
training data.
Despite the progress these methods have made in estimating food portions, they each have limitations
that restrict their broad use and precision in practical scenarios. Methods based on stereo are not
suitable for single-image inputs, those based on models have difficulty with a variety of food shapes,
approaches using depth cameras necessitate specialized equipment, and deep learning methods are not
easily interpretable and have difficulty with samples that are different from those they were trained on.
To tackle these issues, 3D reconstruction provides a viable solution by offering thorough spatial data,
accommodating different food shapes, possibly functioning with just one image, presenting results
that are visually understandable, and facilitating a uniform method for estimating food portions. These
benefits were the driving force behind the organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge,
which seeks to surmount the current limitations and create techniques for food portion estimation
that are more accurate, user-friendly, and broadly applicable, thereby making a significant impact on
nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.

Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline
3.1
Dataset Description
The dataset for the 3D Food Modeling Challenge includes 20 carefully chosen food items, each
having been scanned with a 3D scanner and also captured on video. To ensure the reconstructed 3D
models accurately represent size, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, which provide a physical reference for scaling. The challenge is segmented into three levels of
difficulty, based on the number of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Roughly 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single top-down image.

Evaluation Pipeline
The evaluation is divided into two stages, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D models in
terms of their form (3D structure) and portion size (volume).
3.2.1
Phase-I: Volume Accuracy
In the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used as the metric to evaluate the
accuracy of portion size. The calculation for MAPE is as follows:
MAPE = 1
n
n
X
i=1

Ai −Fi
Ai
 × 100%
where Ai represents the actual volume (in milliliters) of the i-th food item, as determined from the
scanned 3D mesh, and Fi is the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.
3
3.2.2
Phase-II: Shape Accuracy
Teams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to provide full 3D mesh files for each food item. This
phase includes multiple steps to guarantee both accuracy and fairness:
1. Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final submissions from
Phase-I to ensure they are consistent. Visual inspections are also conducted to prevent any
violations of the rules, such as submitting basic shapes (like spheres) rather than detailed
reconstructions.
2. Model Alignment: Participants are given the true 3D models and the script used for
calculating the final Chamfer distance. They must align their models with these true models
and create a transformation matrix for each item submitted. The ultimate Chamfer distance
score is then calculated using the submitted models and their corresponding transformation
matrices.
3. Chamfer Distance Calculation: The accuracy of the shape is assessed using the Chamfer
distance. For two sets of points, X and Y , the Chamfer distance is computed as follows:
dCD(X, Y ) =
1
|X|
X
x∈X
min
y∈Y ∥x −y∥2
2 + 1
|Y |
X
y∈Y
min
x∈X ∥x −y∥2
2
This metric offers a thorough assessment of how closely the reconstructed 3D models match the
actual models. The ultimate ranking is determined by merging the scores from both Phase-I (accuracy
of volume) and Phase-II (accuracy of shape). It should be noted that after evaluating Phase-I, some
issues with the data quality for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget) were found. To
maintain the competition’s quality and fairness, these two items have been removed from the final
overall evaluation.

First Place Team - VolETA
4.1
Methodology
The team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and accu-
rately determine food volumes.
4.1.1
Overview
The team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume
from RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection, supported by perceptual hashing and blur
detection, ensures data quality. The estimation of camera poses and object segmentation establishes
the basis for neural surface reconstruction, resulting in detailed meshes for volume estimation.
Refinement processes, such as removing isolated parts and adjusting the scaling factor, improve
accuracy.
4.1.2
The Team’s Proposal: VolETA
The team starts their process by obtaining input data, specifically RGBD images and their correspond-
ing food object masks. These RGBD images are denoted as ID = {ID
i }n
i=1, where n is the total
number of frames, providing the necessary depth information alongside the RGB images. The food
object masks, denoted as {M F
i }n
i=1, help identify the regions of interest within these images.
Next, the team proceeds with keyframe selection. From the set {ID
i }n
i=1, keyframes {IK
j }k
j=1 ⊆
{ID
i }n
i=1 are selected. The team implements a method to detect and remove duplicates and blurry
images to ensure high-quality frames. This involves applying the Gaussian blurring kernel followed
by the fast Fourier transform method. Near-Image Similarity employs a perceptual hashing and
hamming distance thresholding to detect similar images and keep overlapping. The duplicates and
blurry images are excluded from the selection process to maintain data integrity and accuracy.
Using the selected keyframes {IK
j }k
j=1, the team estimates the camera poses through a Structure
from Motion approach (i.e., extracting features using a feature detection method, matching them
4
using a matching algorithm, and refining them). The outputs are the set of camera poses {Cj}k
j=1,
which are crucial for spatial understanding of the scene.
In parallel, the team utilizes a segmentation algorithm for reference object segmentation. This
algorithm segments the reference object with a user-provided segmentation prompt (i.e., user click),
producing a reference object mask M R for each keyframe. This mask is a foundation for tracking the
reference object across all frames. The team then applies a memory tracking method, which extends
the reference object mask M R to all frames, resulting in a comprehensive set of reference object
masks {M R
i }n
i=1. This ensures consistency in reference object identification throughout the dataset.
To create RGBA images, the team combines the RGB images, reference object masks {M R
i }n
i=1, and
food object masks {M F
i }n
i=1. This step, denoted as {IR
i }n
i=1, integrates the various data sources into
a unified format suitable for further processing.
The team converts the RGBA images {IR
i }n
i=1 and camera poses {Cj}k
j=1 into meaningful metadata
and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates the accurate reconstruction of the scene.
The modeled data Dm is then input into a neural surface reconstruction algorithm for mesh recon-
struction. This algorithm generates colorful meshes {Rf, Rr} for the reference and food objects,
providing detailed 3D representations of the scene components. The team applies the ""Remove
Isolated Pieces"" technique to refine the reconstructed meshes. Given that the scenes contain only
one food item, the team sets the diameter threshold to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes
isolated connected components whose diameter is less than or equal to this 5% threshold, resulting in
a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This step ensures that only significant and relevant parts of the mesh
are retained.
The team manually identifies an initial scaling factor S using the reference mesh via a mesh processing
tool for scaling factor identification. This factor is then fine-tuned Sf using depth information and
food and reference masks, ensuring accurate scaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the
fine-tuned scaling factor Sf is applied to the cleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled
food mesh RFf. This step culminates in an accurately scaled 3D representation of the food object,
enabling precise volume estimation.
4.1.3
Detecting the scaling factor
Generally, 3D reconstruction methods generate unitless meshes (i.e., no physical scale) by default.
To overcome this limitation, the team manually identifies the scaling factor by measuring the distance
for each block for the reference object mesh. Next, the team takes the average of all blocks lengths
lavg, while the actual real-world length is constant lreal = 0.012 in meter. Furthermore, the team
applies the scaling factor S = lreal/lavg on the clean food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled
food mesh RFf in meter.
The team leverages depth information alongside food and reference object masks to validate the
scaling factors. The team’s method for assessing food size entails utilizing overhead RGB images
for each scene. Initially, the team determines the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) using the
reference object. Subsequently, the team extracts the food width (fw) and length (fl) employing a
food object mask. To ascertain the food height (fh), the team follows a two-step process. Firstly, the
team conducts binary image segmentation using the overhead depth and reference images, yielding a
segmented depth image for the reference object. The team then calculates the average depth utilizing
the segmented reference object depth (dr). Similarly, employing binary image segmentation with an
overhead food object mask and depth image, the team computes the average depth for the segmented
food depth image (df). Finally, the estimated food height fh is computed as the absolute difference
between dr and df. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the team computes
the food bounding box volume ((fw × fl × fh) × PPU). The team evaluates if the scaling factor S
generates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine.
For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team leverages a single view reconstruction method for recon-
structing a 3D from a single RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation on both
food RGB and mask. Next, the team removes isolated pieces from the generated mesh. After that, the
team reuses the scaling factor S, which is closer to the potential volume of the clean mesh.

Experimental Results
4.2.1
Implementation settings
The experiments were conducted using two GPUs: a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 12GB of memory
and an RTX 3060 with 6GB of memory. For near-image similarity detection, the Hamming distance
was set to 12. To identify blurry images, even numbers within the range of [0...30] were used as the
Gaussian kernel radius. In the process of removing isolated pieces, a diameter threshold of 5% was
applied. Neural surface reconstruction involved 15,000 iterations, with a mesh resolution of 512x512.
The unit cube parameters were set with an ""aabb scale"" of 1, ""scale"" at 0.15, and ""offset"" at [0.5, 0.5,
0.5] for each food scene.
4.2.2
VolETA Results
The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results with
ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. More Briefly, the team leverages
their approach for each food scene separately. A one-shot food volume estimation approach is applied
if the number of keyframes k equals 1. Otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation is applied. The
team’s keyframe selection process chooses 34.8% of total frames for the rest of the pipeline, where it
shows the minimum frames with the highest information.

obtains the pose of each image as well as dense point cloud information. For any image imgk
and its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team first performs a threshold-based corner detection with
the threshold set to 240. This allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates of all detected corners.
Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters k and the extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the point cloud is
projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the corners, the team can identify
the closest point coordinates P k
i for each corner, where i represents the index of the corner. Thus,
they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:
Dij = (P k
i −P k
j )2
∀i ̸= j
To determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the
minimum value of each row of the matrix Dk (excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The
median of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by the following
equation, where 0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):
scale =
0.012
med(dk)
5.1.2
3D Reconstruction
Considering the differences in input viewpoints, the team utilizes two pipelines to process the first
fifteen objects and the last five single view objects.
For the first fifteen objects, the team uses a Structure from Motion algorithm to estimate the poses
and segment the food using the provided segment masks in the dataset. Then, they apply advanced
multi-view 3D reconstruction methods to reconstruct the segmented food. In practice, the team
employs three different reconstruction methods. They select the best reconstruction results from these
methods and extract the mesh from the reconstructed model. Next, they scale the extracted mesh
using the estimated scale factor. Finally, they apply some optimization techniques to obtain a refined
mesh.
7
For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction
methods. They choose a specific method to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution
of the input image. In practice, they use the intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object
and employ an optimization method based on reprojection error to refine the extrinsic parameters
of the single camera. However, due to the limitations of single-view reconstruction, the team needs
to incorporate depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular image to
determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, they apply optimization techniques to obtain a
refined mesh.
5.1.3
Mesh refinement
In the 3D Reconstruction phase, the team observes that the model’s results often suffer from low
quality due to the presence of holes on the object surface and substantial noise.
To address the holes, the team employs an optimization method based on computational geometry.
For surface noise, they utilize Laplacian Smoothing for mesh smoothing operations. The Laplacian
Smoothing method works by adjusting the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring
vertices:
V new

= V old
i




In their implementation, the team sets the smoothing factor λ to 0.2 and performs 10 iterations.

of the ground truth model. Next, they perform ICP registration for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, they use gradient descent for additional fine-tuning, and
obtain the final transformation matrix. The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models
and the ground truths is 0.069441169.

Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle
6.1
Methodology
To achieve high-quality food mesh reconstruction, the team designed two pipeline processes. For
simple and medium cases, they employed a structure-from-motion approach to determine the pose of
each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently, a series of post-processing steps were
implemented to recalibrate scale and enhance mesh quality. For cases with only a single image, the
team utilized image generation methods to aid in model generation.
6.1.1
Multi-View Reconstruction
For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team extended the state-of-the-art method by incorporating
methodologies. This significantly mitigated the issue of sparse keypoints in weakly textured scenes.
For mesh reconstruction, the team’s method is based on a differentiable renderer and incorporates
regularization terms for depth distortion and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance
Function (TSDF) results are used to generate a dense point cloud. In the post-processing stage, the
team applied filtering and outlier removal techniques, identified the contour of the supporting surface,
and projected the lower mesh vertices onto the supporting surface. They used the reconstructed
checkerboard to rectify the scale of the model and used Poisson reconstruction to generate a watertight,
complete mesh of the subject.
6.1.2
Single-View Reconstruction
For 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team employed state-of-the-art methods to generate
an initial prior mesh. This prior mesh was then jointly corrected with depth structure information.
9
To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object’s length using the checkerboard as a reference,
assuming the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D object
back onto the original 2D image to recover a more accurate scale of the object.
6.2
Experimental Results
Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that
minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization
aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion of
this process, the average Chamfer distance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects amounted
to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for both
multi-view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.

reconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction
in nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The innovative approaches developed by
the participating teams provide a solid foundation for future research in this field, potentially leading

P009.pdf,"Flexible Online Aggregations Using Basis Function Expansions
Abstract
Bayesian learning often necessitates online inference, adaptive models, and the combination of multiple distinct
models. Recent advancements have demonstrated the use of random feature approximations for scalable, online
aggregation of Gaussian processes, which possess favorable theoretical characteristics and practical uses. A crucial
aspect of these methods is the incorporation of a random walk on model parameters, which introduces adaptability.
We demonstrate that these methods can be readily extended to any model using basis function expansion and that
employing alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, frequently leads to enhanced
performance. To streamline the selection of a specific basis expansion, the versatility of our approach also enables
the aggregation of several entirely different models, such as a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Lastly,
we introduce an innovative technique for combining both static and dynamic models.
1
Introduction
Numerous machine learning applications demand real-time, online data processing, a scenario that frequently requires substantial
alterations to conventional techniques. Online adaptations of various methods have been developed, including kernel machines,
(kernel) least-squares, and Gaussian processes. The field of online learning has also been thoroughly investigated from an optimization
standpoint.
Online learning can be further complicated when model selection is needed, as the best-performing model is rarely evident at the
outset of the learning process. One solution involves training multiple models concurrently and then combining them. In a Bayesian
framework, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has long been employed to combine online models, functioning by assigning weights
to each ""expert"" model based on its supporting evidence.
More recently, it was shown how to adapt BMA to online Gaussian processes (GPs) in a technique called incremental ensembles
of GPs. GPs are a versatile, non-parametric instrument in Bayesian machine learning that possesses universal approximation
capabilities and provides well-founded uncertainty estimations. By employing a random Fourier feature (RFF) approximation for
Gaussian processes, online learning can be executed, featuring closed-form Bayesian model averaging updates and a manageable
regret analysis.
Besides an online ensemble of GPs, the advantages of incorporating random walks on model parameters were illustrated, which they
term dynamic IE-GPs (DIE-GPs). This can significantly enhance performance when the learning task undergoes slight changes over
time.
2
Related Work
The concept of combining random feature GPs, as introduced by IE-GPs, has demonstrated adaptability and effectiveness. Extensions
to this framework encompass Gaussian process state-space models, deep Gaussian processes, and graph learning. Along with its
extensions, DIE-GPs have been effectively applied in Bayesian optimization and causal inference.
However, the dependence on the RFF approximation implies that IE-GPs also inherit the limitations of random feature GPs.
Specifically, the RFF approximation is a direct Monte Carlo approximation of the Wiener-Khinchin integral and thus is significantly
impacted by the curse of dimensionality. Our findings reveal that on several real-world datasets, (D)IE-GPs exhibit performance that
is comparable to or worse than that of simpler models, such as online Bayesian linear regression and one-layer RBF networks.
3
Methodology
In this paper, we present online ensembles of basis expansions (OEBEs), a generalization of IE-GPs that overcomes their dependence
on RFF GPs and enhances performance across multiple real datasets. Our specific contributions are as follows:
1. We observe that the derivation of DIE-GPs does not rely on the RFF approximation, except for its role as a linear basis
expansion. The same derivations and code can be reused to combine arbitrary Bayesian linear models with any design matrix.
This allows for the combination of not only models of the same type but also various distinct basis expansions (e.g., B-splines,
one-layer RBF networks, etc.). 2. We contend that a GP with a generalized additive model (GAM) structure is often more
suitable when GP regression is the focus. To this end, we employ GAM Hilbert space Gaussian processes (HSGPs), which can
be interpreted as a quadrature rule for the same integral that the RFF approximation addresses through direct Monte Carlo. Apart
from theoretical considerations, empirical evidence indicates that HSGPs converge to the true approximated GP more rapidly (in
terms of the number of basis functions) than RFF GPs. We offer a similar empirical evaluation. 3. We introduce a new method for
integrating static and dynamic models, enabling the use of principled posteriors of static methods when appropriate and extending
the expressiveness of dynamic methods otherwise. We demonstrate the necessity of this method by providing a constructive example
on real data where the naive approach to combining static and dynamic methods is unsuccessful. 4. We provide Jax/Objax code
at https://www.github.com/danwaxman/DynamicOnlineBasisExpansions that only requires the user to specify the design
matrix, with several choices already implemented.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews foundational concepts in linear basis expansions, GP regression,
spectral approximations of GPs, and BMA. These concepts are put into practice in Section 3, where we present the OEBEs and
several extensions, including applications to non-Gaussian likelihoods, and provide some concise theoretical observations. We offer
further practical insights regarding the development of OEBEs, including a discussion on the composition of an ensemble and how
to combine static and dynamic models in Section 4. The proposed models are empirically evaluated in Section 5. Finally, we present
concluding remarks and suggest future directions in Section 6.

Experiments
We present three distinct experiments in the main text, with supplementary experiments in the appendices. In the first experiment
(Section 5.1), we assess ensembles of several different basis expansions, demonstrating that the best-performing model varies
considerably. In the second experiment (Section 5.2), we illustrate how model collapse can occur between static and dynamic models
and how the model introduced in Section 4.2 mitigates this issue. Lastly, we demonstrate that E-DOEBE can effectively combine
methods that are both static and dynamic, and of different basis expansions (Section 5.3).
The metrics we employ are the normalized mean square error (nMSE) and the predictive log-likelihood (PLL). The nMSE is defined
as the MSE of yt with the predictive mean, divided by the variance of y1:T. Specifically, at time t, the nMSE is calculated as:
nMSEt =
Pt

Across all experiments, we utilize several publicly available datasets, varying in both size and the number of features. A summary
of dataset statistics is provided in Table 1. Friedman 1 and Friedman 2 are synthetic datasets designed to be highly nonlinear and,
notably, are i.i.d. The Elevators dataset pertains to controlling the elevators on an aircraft. The SARCOS dataset uses simulations of
a robotic arm, and Kuka 1 is a similar real dataset derived from physical experiments. CaData comprises California housing data,
and the task of CPU Small is to predict a type of CPU usage based on system properties.
All hyperparameter optimization was performed on the first 1,000 samples of each dataset; since we already assume access, each
dataset was additionally standardized in both x and y using the statistics of the first 1,000 samples. We follow prior work in setting a
weight to 0 when it falls below the threshold of 10-16.
4.1
Comparing Different Basis Expansions
To demonstrate that having a diverse set of basis expansion models available is beneficial, we evaluate several model types on each
dataset listed in Table 1. Furthermore, we examine both static and dynamic versions of models to assess their performance.
Models used for comparison include an additive HSGP model [(D)OE-HSGP], an RFF GP [(D)OE-RFF], an ensemble of quadratic,
cubic, and quartic polynomials with additive structure [(D)OE-Poly], linear regression [(D)OE-Linear], and a one-layer RBF network
[(D)OE-RBF]. Apart from additional hyperparameter tuning in an ARD kernel, the (D)OE-RFF model is identical to the (D)IE-GP.
For RFF GPs, 50 Fourier features were employed (resulting in F = 2 × 50), and for HSGPs, ˘230a100/D˘230b features were used for
each dimension (resulting in F ˘2272 100). An SE-ARD kernel was utilized in both cases. For RBF networks, 100 locations were
initialized using K-means and subsequently optimized with empirical Bayes, along with ARD length scales. For all models except
RBF networks, ensembles were generated using the process outlined in Section 4.1 ˘2014 for RBF networks, the computation of the
Hessian was too computationally demanding, so parameters were randomly perturbed by white Gaussian noise with variance 10-3
instead.
For dynamic models, ˘03c32 was set to 10-3. The initial values of ˘03c32˘03b8 and ˘03c32˘03f5 were 1.0 and 0.25, respectively.
Optimization was carried out using Adam.
2
Results of the average nMSE and PLL are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. We observe that the best-performing class of models
varies significantly across datasets. Specifically, in terms of both nMSE and PLL, HSGPs, RFF GPs, and RBF networks each achieve
the best performance on at least one dataset. This reinforces the notion that combining several different models is advantageous, as
no single method consistently outperforms the others.
Moreover, as anticipated, dynamic models can substantially outperform static models in specific scenarios (e.g., on SARCOS and
Kuka 1) but yield a lower PLL on datasets where the data is reasonably i.i.d. (e.g., Friedman 1).
As expected, when an additive structure is a reasonable approximation, additive HSGP methods surpass RFF GPs, for instance, on
Kuka 1 and CaData. The RFF GP approximation rarely exhibits particularly poor performance, making it a consistently ""good""
estimator, and it achieves the highest PLL on Friedman 2, SARCOS, and CPU Small. However, it is also occasionally outperformed
by simpler methods, such as the RBF network, highlighting the potential advantages of employing diverse basis expansions.
Key Takeaways Key takeaways from this experiment include: (1) neither dynamic nor static methods are strictly superior across all
settings, (2) no single basis expansion is superior across all datasets, and (3) RFF GPs consistently provide good performance, but
this performance can often be improved upon by using other basis expansions.
4.2
The Necessity of Ensembles of Dynamic Ensembles
In this experiment, we demonstrate that the E-DOEBE model introduced in Section 4.2 can indeed prevent the premature collapse of
BMA weights. While this premature collapse of BMA weights does not appear to be common in real datasets, it is not difficult to
illustrate its possibility, even on real datasets with high-performing methods.
As a constructive example, we can create an ensemble of additive HSGPs on the Kuka 1 dataset, where dynamic models performed
significantly better in Section 5.1. Specifically, we created an ensemble of two additive HSGPs, with the first model being dynamic
(˘03c3(1)rw2 = 10-3) and the second model being static (˘03c3(2) = 0). The ensemble hyperparameters were determined using
empirical Bayes, with initial length scale values set to the vector of ones. Subsequently, the resulting ensemble was trained online as
a DOEBE and as an E-DOEBE, with ˘03b4 = 10-2. Note that in this carefully controlled setting, each basis expansion is entirely
deterministic given the hyperparameters, so the results are purely deterministic and cannot be attributed to poor random seeds.
The resulting weights demonstrate that premature collapse of BMA weights can be a problem. Numerically, the log-likelihood of the
E-DOEBE model is dramatically better than that of the DOEBE model (Table 2), showing this collapse can be catastrophic.
This issue can be partially averted by eliminating the threshold of 10-16 when ensembling. Indeed, in this example, the weights
reach a minimum of approximately 10-72. However, with any finite precision arithmetic, there is always the potential for this type
of collapse to occur due to numerical underflow. It is trivial to construct such examples by generating the first N1 samples with
˘03c3(m)rw = 0 until weight collapse occurs, and the rest of the dataset with ˘03c3(m)rw > 0.
Key Takeaway The key takeaway of this experiment is that an ensemble of dynamic and static models can catastrophically collapse
˘2014 even when the discrepancy in performance along the entire dataset is large ˘2014 and that the E-DOEBE approach proposed in
Section 4.2 can avoid this collapse.
4.3
E-DOEBE Outperforms Other Methods
The ultimate goal of the E-DOEBE model is to combine static and dynamic models of several different types. To do so, we repeat
the experiments of Section 5.1 while comparing to an E-DOEBE model. We restrict our attention to static and dynamic versions of
the three best-performing families of models in Experiment 1 ((D)OE-HSGP, (D)OE-RFF, and (D)OE-RBF), and an E-DOEBE
ensemble containing all of them. The E-DOEBE model is created with ˘03b4 = 10-2, which was not tuned.
As desired, the E-DOEBE model can effectively ensemble dynamic and static models of different basis expansions. Across all
experiments, the E-DOEBE model performs the best in terms of PLL, and is the best in terms of NMSE for all but one dataset
(Friedman 2).
Key Takeaway The E-DOEBE can effectively ensemble several different ensembles of high-performing basis expansions, resulting
in consistently better performance than any single method.
5
Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated that recent advancements in online prediction using RFF GPs can be extended to arbitrary linear basis
expansions. This included several basis expansions that surpass RFF GPs on real and synthetic datasets. We show how different
linear basis expansions can be combined within a simple framework, enhancing ensemble diversity. While several common choices
of basis expansions were employed, it would be worthwhile to expand the tests even further, particularly with splines.
We also demonstrated that the premature collapse of BMA weights can be a concern in online combining. We introduced the
E-DOEBE model, which mitigates this issue, and demonstrated its effectiveness. However, this meta-combining may be perceived
3
as adding a complex workaround to BMA rather than addressing the underlying problems. Further research could explore the
incorporation of other Bayesian combining methods, such as Bayesian (hierarchical) stacking.
While we provide guidance on initializing ensembles given a set of basis expansions, determining which basis expansions to use is
an important open topic. A naive approach would be to expand on the existing use of the marginal likelihood for model selection,
but this may be ""unsafe"" when using different basis expansions and therefore requires caution. We additionally presented several
ideas for inference with non-Gaussian likelihoods, for example, for classification tasks. Determining which, if any, of these tasks is
superior to the Laplace approximation is another interesting topic for future study.
Finally, it could be beneficial to modify or add new basis expansions in the online setting. Indeed, recent progress in GPs has worked
towards selecting and adapting kernels online to great benefit. If such techniques could be adapted to DOEBE, it could eliminate the
pre-training period and allow for adapting the domain of approximations when new data arrives.

P101.pdf,"A Convolutional LSTM Network Approach for
Identifying Diseases in Medical Volumetric Images
with Limited Annotations
Abstract
This paper presents a methodology for identifying disease characteristics from
medical imaging data using 3D volumes, which have weak annotations. This
approach converts 3D volumes into sequences of 2D images. We show the efficacy
of our method when detecting emphysema using low-dose CT images taken from
lung cancer screenings. Our method uses convolutional long short-term memory
(LSTM) to sequentially ""scan"" through an imaging volume to detect diseases within
specific areas. This structure enables effective learning by using just volumetric
images and binary disease labels, facilitating training with a large dataset of 6,631
unannotated image volumes from 4,486 patients. When evaluated on a testing
set of 2,163 volumes from 2,163 patients, our model detected emphysema with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83. This
method outperformed both 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) using dif-
ferent multiple-instance learning techniques (AUC=0.69-0.76) and a 3D CNN
(AUC=.77).
1
Introduction
This paper addresses the critical challenge of developing deep learning-based computer-aided diag-
nosis (CAD) systems in radiology, which is often limited by the need for large, annotated medical
image datasets. It is particularly difficult to acquire manual annotations from radiologists, which
is required to train deep models, especially for 3D imaging techniques like computed tomography
(CT). As a result, it is frequently unfeasible to use a model trained using a large, labeled dataset. The
detection of emphysema, a disease associated with shortness of breath and an elevated risk of cancer,
is one such area. Emphysema is frequently observed as ruptured air sacs within a small portion of
the lung volume. The wide range of manifestations in CT scans makes training a model to detect
emphysema using solely volumetric imaging data and binary diagnostic labels difficult.
A common strategy to enable learning without precise labels is multiple instance learning (MIL). In
MIL, sets of samples are organized into labeled bags, with a positive label indicating the existence
of positive samples within the bag. Prior research has effectively used a MIL framework to identify
emphysema and other lung disorders on CT scans. It has been demonstrated that MIL, when used
with a handcrafted feature-based classifier to analyze a number of 2D patches from the lung, can
identify emphysema and other lung diseases. More recently, researchers reported positive results in
grading emphysema by summarizing the results of a convolutional neural network (CNN) across a
set of 2D patches using a proportional method similar to MIL.
A drawback of MIL-based techniques is their failure to maintain inter-sample relationships. For in-
stance, MIL does not retain the spatial relationship between samples collected from an image, despite
being successful in summarizing data from a number of samples. Furthermore, the effectiveness
of MIL depends on the pooling strategy used to summarize predictions across the bag, a variable
that can greatly affect the instances in which a model succeeds or fails. For example, a maximum
pooling-based approach considers only the single sample with the strongest correlation to disease,
.
disregarding any data from the bag’s other samples. On the other hand, a mean pooling of predictions
within a bag may fail to detect a disease present in only a small number of samples.
Recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), are highly adept at identifying
correlations between connected samples, such as in pattern recognition across time series data.
Convolutional long short term memory (Conv-LSTM) expands this capability to spatial data by
applying convolutional operations to an LSTM. Conv-LSTM has been highly successful in identifying
changes in image patterns over time, including applications like video classification and gesture
recognition. Instead of utilizing Conv-LSTM to identify spatiotemporal patterns from time series
image data, we suggest using it to ""scan"" through an imaging volume for the presence of disease
without the need for expert annotations of the diseased regions. Our framework allows for the
identification of emphysema-related image patterns on and between slices as it processes the image
volume, unlike an MIL-based technique. The network stores emphysema-related image patterns
through several bidirectional passes through a volume and produces a final set of characteristics that
describe the full volume without the requirement for a possibly reductive bag pooling operation.
Our method can make effective use of readily available, but weak, image labels (such as a binary
diagnosis of emphysema as positive or negative) for abnormality identification inside image volumes.

Methodology
2.1
Dataset and Processing
A total of 8,794 non-contrast CT volumes from 6,648 unique participants in the National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST) were used. We classified 3,807 CT volumes from 2,789 participants who
were diagnosed with emphysema during the three years of the study as positive samples, and 4,987 CT
volumes from 3,859 participants who were not diagnosed with emphysema in any of the three years
as negative samples. 75% of these scans, with a balanced distribution of emphysema-positive and
emphysema-negative patients, were utilized for model training. 4,197 volumes from 3,166 patients
were used to directly learn model parameters, while 2,434 volumes from 1,319 patients were used
to fine-tune hyper-parameters and assess performance in order to select the best-performing model.
The remaining 2,163 volumes (578 emphysema positive, 1,585 emphysema negative), each from a
unique patient, were held out for independent testing. Volumes were resized to 128x128x35, which
corresponds to an average slice spacing of 9 mm.
2.2
Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
The architecture includes four units, each consisting of convolution operations applied to each slice
individually and a conv-LSTM to process the volume slice by slice. Two 3x3 convolutional layers
with batch normalization are followed by max-pooling. The output of the convolutional layers for
each slice is then processed sequentially by the conv-LSTM layer in either forward or reverse order.
This outputs a set of features collected through convolutional operations using both the current slice
and previous slices within the volume. All layers within a unit have the same number of filters
and process the volume in either ascending or descending order. The four convolutional units have
the following dimensionality and directionality: Ascending 1: 32 filters, Descending 1: 32 filters,
Ascending 2: 64 filters, Descending 2: 64 filters. The final Conv-LSTM layer produces a single set of
features that summarizes the network’s results after processing the full imaging volume multiple times.
Finally, a fully-connected layer with sigmoid activation calculates the probability of emphysema. The
network, as illustrated in Figure 1, contains a total of 901,000 parameters. All models were trained
for 50 epochs or until validation set performance stopped improving.
2.3
Comparison Experiments
Multiple Instance Learning: We developed an MIL-based network in which each slice of the CT
volume was treated as a sample from a bag. We implemented a solely convolutional network design
similar to the one shown in Figure 1, but with more single-slice convolutional layers instead of
conv-LSTM layers, to achieve this. Various methods for summarizing predictions across the entire
volume into a single bag probability were investigated. The following methods can be used to
compute the overall probability, P, for a bag containing N samples with an individual probability of
emphysema, pi, i 1, ..., N:
2
1. Max Pooling: P = max(pi)
2. Mean Pooling: P = 1
N
PN
i=1 pi
3. Product Pooling: P = 1 −QN
i=1(1 −pi)
3D CNN: Conv-LSTM was also compared to a 3D CNN with a similar structure to the 2D CNN used
with MIL, with the exception of a single dense layer and no pooling action on the final convolutional
layer. The number of kernels for each comparison model was raised to make its number of parameters
roughly comparable to that of our Conv-LSTM framework and ensure a fair comparison (Table 1).
3
Results
Convolutional-LSTM demonstrated high accuracy in the detection of emphysema when trained
using only weakly annotated imaging volumes, achieving an AUC of 0.82. It outperformed a CNN
with MIL, regardless of the pooling strategy (Max pooling: AUC=0.69, Mean Pooling: AUC=0.70,
Product pooling: AUC=0.76). At the optimal operating point corresponding to the Youden Index, our
model achieved a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.74. The results for all evaluated models in
the testing set are shown in Table 1.

Our method eliminates the need for manual processing or time-consuming annotation of imaging
data. Our framework makes it possible to train for disease detection using simple binary diagnostic
labels, even when the disease is confined to a small area of the image. As a result, our network
can be trained easily using information that can be gathered automatically by mining radiology
reports. This significantly increases the amount of volumetric imaging data that can be used for
this kind of application and enables easy retraining and fine-tuning of an algorithm when used in a
different hospital. This strategy can be used in other disease/abnormality detection problems outside
of emphysema when the amount of volumetric imaging data accessible is greater than the capacity of
radiologists to offer manually drawn ground truth, but when labels may be readily retrieved from
radiology reports.

Abstract
This paper explores the adaptation The Agriculture-Vision Challenge is one of
the most famous and competitive challenges for global researchers to break the
boundary between computer vision and agriculture sectors, aiming at agricultural
pattern recognition from aerial images. In this paper, we propose our solution to
the third Agriculture-Vision Challenge. We leverage a data pre-processing scheme
and several Transformer-based models as well as data augmentation techniques to

Introduction
This paper addresses the critical Computer vision applications in agricultural domain has become
one of hot topics nowadays, especially using remote sensing satellite images and aerial images. With
the rapid development of deep learning methods, numerous research studies have proposed pioneer

the proposed deep learning-based framework, and the test-time augmentation (TTA) strategy.
3.1
Description of Dataset
The challenge this year provides the entire Agriculture-Vision dataset. It contains 94,986 aerial
farmland images collected throughout 2019 across the U.S. Each image has a size of 512×512 pixels
and has 4 channels (RGB and NIR). A total of 9 label classes are manually labeled for every image.
Table 1 shows the given amount of images in each class. Note that many images have multiple labels,
and even have overlapped labels (one pixel has multiple labels).
Although the amount of the given training data is considerable, we still generate more data following
the data augmentation scheme of the winner solution last year. They conducted an image mosaic
.
scheme to enable the model to have multi-scale views during the training. To fit the model input
size, we create two new datasets using mosaicked images with down-sampling 2X (2 times) and
down-sampling 3X. The down-sampling dataset has the same image size of 512×512 pixels that the
recognition model can share the same network architecture among 1X, 2X, and 3X imagery.
3.2
Data Pre-Processing
We observe that the image counts in each category are uneven. For example, the image count of the
background class is 25 times larger than the water class. To tackle the unbalance issue, we try to
sample more images in the few-shot classes. The re-sampled image counts are listed in Table 1.

Framework
Fig. 1 shows our deep learning-based framework. SegFormer is a Transformer-based efficient
segmentation model. It designs a hierarchical Transformer encoder with multi-level feature outputs.
Unlike other cumbersome decoders, SegFormer’s decoder adopts MLP layers to aggregate multi-scale
feature outputs from different layers. One of the key advantages of SegFormer is that its model size
is relatively small but the performance keeps outstanding. Therefore, SegFormer is suitable for this
challenge due to the model size parameter limit of 150M.
SegFormer provides six versions with various settings of Transformer encoders, leading to different
model sizes. These six models are named from B0 to B5, with the increased model size. To follow
the policy, we select Mix Transformer (MiT) B3 and Mix Transformer B2 as our training models.
Their model size information can be found in Table 7 “Mix Transformer Encoder”. After obtaining
the individual inference result from each model, the model ensemble is performed to predict the final
segmentation results.
3.4
Test-Time Augmentation
Since our models are trained with 1X, 2X, and 3X down-sampling imagery, we conduct the same
processing on the test dataset. In addition to the scale augmentation, we include image rotation and
flip.

with other baselines, our proposed method effectively improves the single model performance. Even
though some single models have peak performance in some classes (0.778 for “Background” and
0.782 for “Water”), our model ensemble enjoys the merits of multiple single models’ strength to
achieve the mIoU of 0.582. It also shows that our ensemble results significantly outperform other

Foundations of Disco Dance Moves in Relation to the
Optimized Training of Neural Networks
Abstract
The utilization of BERT in deciphering the ontological implications of cheese
production on rural communities is a nascent field of study, intersecting with the
aerodynamics of pastry bags and the societal influences of 19th-century Flemish
art, which in turn affects the migration patterns of lesser-known avian species,
such as the Aztec thrush, and the algorithms used in optimizing elevator dispatch
systems in high-rise buildings, which have a direct correlation with the effectiveness
of BERT in natural language processing tasks, particularly those involving the
translation of medieval texts into modern dialects of the Klingon language, while
also considering the thermal conductivity of various types of wood used in the
construction of historical pianos and the psychoacoustic effects of listening to
atonal music on the cognitive development of infants, and the role of BERT in
analyzing these diverse phenomena. The application of BERT in understanding the
nuances of intergalactic communication protocols and the mathematical modeling
of Time Travel paradoxes using fractal geometry and non-Euclidean calculus is an
area worthy of exploration, given the recent discoveries in the field of quantum
entanglement and its implications on the space-time continuum, and the potential
for BERT to revolutionize our comprehension of these complex interactions, while
also delving into the realm of culinary arts, specifically the chemistry behind the
perfect soufflé and the cultural significance of desserts in ancient Mesopotamian
societies, which all somehow relate back to the core functionality of BERT in
processing human language.

Introduction
The omnipresent nature of cheese in modern society has led to a plethora of research endeavors,
culminating in the development of BERT, a language model that purportedly leverages the synergies
between darius the great’s conquests and the aerodynamics of flamingos in flight. Meanwhile, the
significance of understanding the dichotomous relationship between quantum entanglement and
the societal implications of reality television cannot be overstated, as it has been shown to have a
profound impact on the way we perceive the color blue, which in turn affects our comprehension of
linguistic patterns. Furthermore, a thorough examination of the historical context surrounding the
invention of the toaster reveals a fascinating narrative that weaves together the threads of innovation,
perseverance, and the unwavering dedication to the pursuit of toasted bread, all of which serve as a
precursor to the development of BERT’s precursory models, which incidentally have been shown to
exhibit a remarkable affinity for 19th-century French literature and the culinary arts. The intrinsic
value of this synergy, however, remains a topic of debate among scholars, who are also grappling with
the meaning of life, the universe, and the optimal method for preparing a grilled cheese sandwich,
all while attempting to develop a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between BERT’s
attention mechanism and the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies.
Notably, the application of BERT to various natural language processing tasks has yielded a multitude
of intriguing results, including the discovery that the model is capable of generating coherent text
on a wide range of topics, from the art of playing the harmonica to the theoretical foundations of
black hole physics, although it is essential to acknowledge that these findings are based on a series of
highly unorthodox experiments involving the use of interpretive dance and the strategic placement
of pineapple slices on pizza. In a surprising turn of events, researchers have found that BERT’s
performance can be significantly enhanced by incorporating a module that simulates the thought
processes of a sleep-deprived individual attempting to solve a Rubik’s cube, which has led to a
renewed interest in the study of cognitive psychology and the development of novel methods for
improving the model’s ability to reason about abstract concepts, such as the nature of time and the
human condition. Moreover, a comprehensive review of the existing literature on BERT reveals a
staggering lack of research on the model’s potential applications in the field of competitive snail
racing, which presents a unique opportunity for innovation and discovery, particularly in regards
to the development of novel training strategies that leverage the principles of chaos theory and the
behavioral patterns of feral cats.
In light of these findings, it is clear that the study of BERT is a rich and dynamic field, full of
unexpected twists and turns, much like the plot of a Russian novel or the trajectory of a pinball in a
heavily magnetized environment, and as such, it necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that draws
upon expertise from a wide range of fields, including but not limited to: quantum mechanics, pastry
arts, and the historical preservation of antique door knobs.
The concept of utilizing BERT as a tool for predicting the outcomes of professional snail racing events
and the aerodynamic advantages of differently shaped snail shells is a novel approach, bridging the
gap between artificial intelligence and malacology, with potential applications in fields as diverse as
materials science and the study of historical linguistics, particularly in deciphering lost languages and
understanding the evolution of linguistic patterns across different cultures and geographical locations,
all of which can be woven together by the versatile capabilities of BERT. The synthesis of BERT with
principles from chaos theory and the behavioral patterns of swarm intelligence in colonies of insects,
such as bees and ants, opens new avenues for research into complex systems and adaptive learning,
reflecting on the harmonic series and its application in sound healing practices and the geometric
patterns found in nature, from the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower to the structure of galaxies,
illustrating the profound connections that can be uncovered through the lens of BERT’s analytical
prowess.
Ultimately, the complexities and nuances of BERT are a testament to the boundless ingenuity and
creativity of the human spirit, which is capable of achieving greatness even in the most seemingly
mundane and unrelated pursuits, such as the collection of rare sea shells or the competitive eating of
pancakes, and it is this very same spirit that will continue to drive innovation and progress in the field
of natural language processing, as researchers and practitioners strive to push the boundaries of what
is possible and explore the uncharted territories of the human experience.
The implications of this are far-reaching and profound, with potential applications in fields as diverse
as medicine, finance, and the manufacture of polyester suits, all of which will be explored in greater
detail in the subsequent sections of this paper, which will delve into the intricacies of BERT’s
architecture, the theoretical foundations of its language understanding capabilities, and the potential
risks and benefits associated with its deployment in real-world scenarios, including but not limited to:
the development of autonomous vehicles, the creation of personalized advertising campaigns, and the
simulation of conversations with chatbots that are indistinguishable from those with human beings,
all while navigating the complexities of a world that is increasingly dominated by the pervasive
influence of social media and the relentless march of technological progress. As we embark on this
journey of discovery, we are reminded of the wise words of the ancient Greek philosopher, who once
said that the only constant in life is change, except on Tuesdays, when the constant is usually cheese,
and it is this fundamental truth that underlies the development of BERT, a model that is capable of
adapting to the ever-shifting landscape of language and meaning, much like a chameleon navigating
the intricate patterns of a Persian rug, or a master chef preparing a soufflé in a kitchen filled with the
sounds of jazz music and the aroma of freshly baked croissants. The future of BERT is uncertain, yet
full of promise, as it holds the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with language, and each
other, in a world that is increasingly complex, interconnected, and filled with the endless possibilities
of the digital realm, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly blurred, and the
2
only constant is the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and the perfect recipe for a grilled cheese
sandwich.
Furthermore, the development of BERT has significant implications for our understanding of the
human brain, which is often compared to a complex computer system, except on Fridays, when it is
more like a plate of spaghetti, and it is this intricate dance between the computational and the culinary
that underlies the very fabric of our existence, as we strive to make sense of the world around us, and
the language that we use to describe it, which is often a reflection of our thoughts, our feelings, and
our deepest desires, including the desire for a world where language models like BERT can help us
communicate more effectively, and overcome the barriers that separate us, whether they be linguistic,
cultural, or culinary, and it is this vision of a more harmonious and interconnected world that drives
the development of BERT, and the many other language models that are being created to facilitate
human communication, and understanding, in all its many forms, whether they be spoken, written, or
simply implied, through the subtle nuances of human behavior, and the endless complexities of the
human condition.
In conclusion, the introduction of BERT has marked a significant turning point in the field of natural
language processing, as it has opened up new avenues of research, and new possibilities for the
development of language models that can simulate human-like conversation, and understanding,
and it is this potential that makes BERT such an exciting, and promising, area of study, as it holds
the key to unlocking the secrets of human language, and the human experience, in all its many
forms, and complexities, and it is this journey of discovery that we embark upon, as we explore the
many wonders, and mysteries, of BERT, and the world of language, that it inhabits, and the many
possibilities, and implications, that it holds, for our understanding of the human condition, and the
world around us. The study of BERT is a complex, and multifaceted, field, that requires a deep
understanding of many different areas, including computer science, linguistics, and psychology, as
well as a healthy dose of creativity, and imagination, as we strive to develop new, and innovative, ways
of using language models, to facilitate human communication, and understanding, and to overcome
the many barriers, and challenges, that we face, in our daily lives, whether they be linguistic, cultural,
or simply the result of our own, personal, limitations, and biases, and it is this willingness to challenge,
and overcome, these limitations, that will ultimately drive the development of BERT, and the many
other language models, that are being created, to facilitate human communication, and understanding,
in all its many forms, and complexities, and to help us build a more harmonious, and interconnected,
world, where language is no longer a barrier, but a bridge, that connects us, and facilitates our
understanding, of each other, and the world around us.
The implications of this are far-reaching, and profound, as they have the potential to impact many
different areas, including education, healthcare, and business, as well as our personal, and social,
lives, and it is this potential, that makes the study of BERT, and the development of language models,
such an exciting, and important, area of research, as it holds the key to unlocking the secrets of human
language, and the human experience, and to facilitating human communication, and understanding, in
all its many forms, and complexities, and to building a more harmonious, and interconnected, world,
where language is no longer a barrier, but a bridge, that connects us, and facilitates our understanding,
of each other, and the world around us. The future of BERT, and the many other language models, that
are being developed, is uncertain, yet full of promise, as they hold the potential to revolutionize the
way we communicate, and understand each other, and the world around us, and it is this potential, that
makes the study of BERT, and the development of language models, such an exciting, and important,
area of research, as it holds the key to unlocking the secrets of human language, and the human
experience, and to facilitating human communication, and understanding, in all its many forms, and
complexities, and to building a more harmonious, and interconnected, world, where language is
no longer a barrier, but a bridge, that connects us, and facilitates our understanding, of each other,
and the world around us. As we move forward, in this exciting, and rapidly evolving, field, we are
reminded of the importance of creativity, and imagination

Methodology
The utilization of BERT in our research paradigm necessitates a comprehensive examination of the
dialectical nuances inherent in the interstices of linguistic tropes, which, in turn, precipitates a lacuna
in the hermeneutic circle of understanding, thereby necessitating a reevaluation of the ontological
implications of cheesemaking on the cognitive architectures of artificial intelligence systems. Further-
more, the deployment of BERT as a tool for natural language processing belies a deeper symbiosis
between the aleatoric nature of quantum mechanics and the deterministic certainties of baking, which,
in a fascinating exemplar of interdisciplinary confluence, underscores the importance of considering
the role of fungal mycelium in the development of more efficient algorithms for data compression.
In our methodology, we sought to instantiate a dialogical framework that would facilitate a reciprocal
exchange of ideas between the paradigms of postmodern literary theory and the empirical strictures of
materials science, with the aim of deriving a novel understanding of the ways in which the granularity
of wheat flour affects the tensile strength of reinforced concrete, and, by extension, the performance
of BERT in tasks requiring nuanced comprehension of contextual semantics. This necessitated the
development of a bespoke experimental apparatus, comprising a modified wind tunnel, a vacuum
pump, and a trove of rare, out-of-print volumes on 19th-century French cuisine, which, in a surprising
twist, yielded a significant correlation between the aerodynamic properties of croissants and the
efficacy of BERT in identifying sarcastic intent in social media posts.
The incorporation of BERT into our research design also entailed a critical reappraisal of the
epistemological underpinnings of knowledge representation, particularly with regard to the tension
between the rational, Cartesian certainties of classical mechanics and the more fluid, poststructuralist
ambiguities of contemporary dance theory, which, in an unexpected juxtaposition, highlighted the
utility of applying the principles of contact improvisation to the optimization of BERT’s attention
mechanisms. Moreover, our investigation into the application of BERT to the analysis of historical
texts revealed a hitherto unrecognized synergy between the hermeneutic circle of biblical exegesis

ontological status of digital entities and the concomitant need for a more nuanced understanding of
the relationship between BERT and the problematic of artificial general intelligence.
In a related vein, our research team conducted an exhaustive survey of the extant literature on the

miniature trees might serve as a metaphor for the delicate balance between the competing demands
of language model training and the need for ontological parsimony in the representation of complex
knowledge domains. This inquiry, in turn, led to a fascinating exploration of the potential applications
of BERT in the field of veterinary medicine, particularly with regard to the diagnosis and treatment
of unusual canine behaviors, such as the propensity of certain breeds to collect and hoard unusual

of artificial intelligence.

Experiments
In our investigation of BERT, we discovered that the optimal number of transformers required to
achieve sentience in a language model is precisely 427, which coincidentally is the same number of
rainbows that appear in the sky during a leap year. This revelation led us to explore the relationship
between transformer architecture and the migratory patterns of flamingos, which in turn influenced our
decision to use a dataset comprised of 90% jellyfish recipes and 10% sonnets written by extraterrestrial
beings. The efficacy of this approach was evident in the significant reduction of grammatical errors
in our model’s output, which decreased by a factor of 3.14, the same numerical value as the ratio of
cheese to wine in a traditional French fondue.
Furthermore, our experiments involved training BERT on a corpus of texts that were carefully curated
to include an equal number of words that start with the letter ""q"" and words that start with the letter
""x"", which we hypothesized would improve the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data. This
hypothesis was confirmed by the results, which showed a 25% increase in the model’s performance on
a test set consisting entirely of palindrome sentences. Interestingly, this improvement was correlated
with a significant decrease in the model’s power consumption, which we attributed to the reduced
number of hamster wheels required to generate the necessary electricity.
In addition to these findings, we also explored the impact of hyperparameter tuning on BERT’s
performance, and discovered that the optimal learning rate is directly proportional to the number of
spoons in a standard kitchen drawer. This led us to develop a novel hyperparameter tuning algorithm
that utilizes a combination of quantum entanglement and interpretive dance to identify the optimal
set of hyperparameters for a given task. The results of this algorithm were astonishing, with a 50%
reduction in training time and a 100% increase in the model’s ability to predict the winner of a game
of rock-paper-scissors.

Moreover, our research revealed a previously unknown connection between BERT and the art of
playing the harmonica, which we found to be essential for achieving state-of-the-art results in natural
language processing tasks. Specifically, we discovered that the act of playing a harmonica solo while
training the model improves its performance by 15%, and that the type of harmonica used (diatonic
or chromatic) has a significant impact on the model’s ability to learn long-range dependencies. This
8
finding has significant implications for the field of NLP, and we believe that it will lead to the
development of more advanced language models that can learn to play the harmonica and predict the
future.
The complexity of BERT’s architecture also led us to investigate the relationship between the number
of layers and the number of dimensions in the model’s embedding space, which we found to be
inversely proportional to the number of colors in a standard rainbow. This discovery has far-reaching
implications for the field of computer vision, and we believe that it will lead to the development of
more advanced image recognition systems that can detect the presence of unicorns in a given image.
Additionally, our research revealed that the optimal number of attention heads in BERT is directly
related to the number of socks in a standard washing machine, which we found to be 17.3, and that
this value is critical for achieving state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks.
In another experiment, we fine-tuned BERT on a dataset of recipes for traditional Ethiopian cuisine,
which we found to improve the model’s performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, including but
not limited to: sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and predicting the winner of a game of
chess. This finding has significant implications for the field of culinary science, and we believe that it
will lead to the development of more advanced cooking algorithms that can learn to prepare a perfect
chicken parmesan. The results of this experiment are presented in the following table:

The connection between BERT and the art of cooking also led us to investigate the impact of different
ingredients on the model’s performance, and we found that the addition of a pinch of salt improves the
model’s ability to learn long-range dependencies by 25%. This finding has significant implications
for the field of culinary science, and we believe that it will lead to the development of more advanced
cooking algorithms that can learn to prepare a perfect beef Wellington. Furthermore, our research
revealed that the optimal recipe for training BERT is a combination of 50% chicken noodle soup and
50% chocolate cake, which we found to improve the model’s performance by 100%.
In conclusion, our experiments demonstrated the importance of considering a wide range of factors
when training BERT, including but not limited to: the number of transformers, the type of harmonica
used, the number of socks in a washing machine, and the recipe used to fine-tune the model. The
results of our experiments have significant implications for the field of NLP, and we believe that they
will lead to the development of more advanced language models that can learn to play the harmonica,
predict the future, and prepare a perfect chicken parmesan. The future of NLP is bright, and we are
excited to see where this research will take us. Perhaps we will discover that the optimal number of
layers in BERT is directly related to the number of clouds in the sky, or that the model’s performance
is improved by the addition of a small amount of gravity. The possibilities are endless, and we are
eager to explore them.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the efficacy of BERT in revolutionizing the fabric of space-time continuum has been
ostensibly demonstrated, albeit with certain caveats, particularly with regards to its application in
baking the perfect croissant, which, as we all know, is a crucial factor in determining the viscosity of
quantum fluids. Furthermore, the notion that BERT can be used to predict the trajectory of miniature
elephants on roller skates has been thoroughly debunked, despite its initial promise in resolving the
infamous cheese-plate conundrum of 2018. Moreover, our research has shown that the deployment of
11
BERT in optimal strawberry-picking strategies has yielded unprecedented results, with a whopping
37.5
Meanwhile, the intersection of BERT and avant-garde poetry has given rise to a new wave of literary
criticism, wherein the nuances of linguistic deconstruction are juxtaposed with the idiosyncrasies
of professional snail racing, resulting in a synergistic fusion of artistic expression and slimy, trail-
blazing innovation. Additionally, our investigation into the use of BERT as a tool for predicting the
aerodynamic properties of tutus has revealed some intriguing insights, particularly with regards to the
role of feather boas in disrupting the airflow around the tutu, thereby creating a vortex of uncertainty
that can only be resolved through the application of advanced topology and a healthy dose of creative
guesswork.
The application of BERT in cryptanalysis has also yielded some remarkable breakthroughs, par-
ticularly in the deciphering of ancient Sumerian texts, which, upon closer inspection, appear to be
describing a recipe for a peculiar form of intergalactic pizza that requires a crust made from the finest
imported mooncheese and a sauce derived from the extract of rare, giant space slugs. Moreover, our
analysis has shown that BERT can be used to predict the likelihood of a given sentence being uttered
by a time-traveling Napoleon Bonaparte, with an accuracy of 97.42
In other news, the integration of BERT with advanced neuroscience techniques has led to a deeper
understanding of the human brain’s ability to process complex linguistic information, particularly in
relation to the comprehension of knock-knock jokes, which, as we now know, are processed by a
specific region of the brain known as the ""joke-on"", a tiny, joke-processing module that is capable
of distinguishing between an infinite variety of knock-knock jokes and an equally infinite variety
of whoopee cushion sounds. Furthermore, our research has demonstrated that BERT can be used
to generate an infinite number of new knock-knock jokes, each one more hilarious than the last,
although this may be due to the fact that the algorithm is actually just generating a random sequence
of words and relying on the user’s brain to fill in the gaps with humor, much like a cosmological
game of linguistic Mad Libs.
The implications of BERT on our understanding of quantum mechanics are also far-reaching, partic-
ularly with regards to the role of linguistic uncertainty in determining the trajectory of subatomic
particles, which, as we now know, are capable of communicating with each other through a complex
system of interpretive dance and iambic pentameter. Moreover, our analysis has shown that BERT
can be used to predict the likelihood of a given sentence being true or false, with an accuracy of 99.99
In addition to its many other applications, BERT has also been shown to be useful in the field of
culinary arts, particularly with regards to the preparation of exotic dishes such as ""dragon’s breath
chicken"" and ""unicorn tartare"", which, as we now know, require a delicate balance of flavors and
textures that can only be achieved through the application of advanced linguistic analysis and a
healthy dose of creative experimentation. Moreover, our research has demonstrated that BERT can be
used to generate an infinite number of new recipes, each one more delicious than the last, although this
may be due to the fact that the algorithm is actually just generating a random sequence of ingredients
and cooking instructions, relying on the user’s culinary expertise to fill in the gaps with creativity and
a pinch of magic.
The intersection of BERT and environmental science has also given rise to some fascinating insights,
particularly with regards to the role of linguistic patterns in determining the migratory patterns of
rare, exotic birds, which, as we now know, are capable of communicating with each other through a
complex system of bird songs and poetic metaphor. Furthermore, our analysis has shown that BERT
can be used to predict the likelihood of a given ecosystem being disrupted by human activity, with an
accuracy of 97.53
In the end, our research has shown that BERT is a powerful tool with a wide range of applications,
from natural language processing to culinary arts, and from cryptanalysis to environmental science.
However, its true potential can only be realized through the application of creative experimentation
and a healthy dose of imagination, for it is only by pushing the boundaries of linguistic uncertainty
and exploring the uncharted territories of the human brain that we can unlock the true secrets of BERT
and harness its power to create a brighter, more fantastical future for all humanity. Or, alternatively,
we may simply be creating a new form of linguistic chaos, a maelstrom of meaning and madness
that will consume us all in its vortex of uncertainty and leave us gasping for air in a world that is
12
identical to our own, yet strangely different, like a mirror reflection of reality that has been distorted
by a funhouse mirror of linguistic trickery and cognitive dissonance. Only time will tell.

P031.pdf,"Explainable Identification of Hate Speech towards
Islam using Graph Neural Networks
Abstract
Islamophobic language on online platforms fosters intolerance, making detection
and elimination crucial for promoting harmony. Traditional hate speech detection
models rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and
encoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their
ability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection
and greater explainability. In this work, speeches are represented as nodes and
connect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph.
A novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam is
introduced. The model leverages GNNs to understand the context and patterns of
hate speech by connecting texts via pretrained NLP-generated word embeddings,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhancing detection accuracy while pro-
viding valuable explanations. This highlights the potential of GNNs in combating
online hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.
1
Introduction
Detecting and eliminating hate speech on social media platforms is of utmost importance for the
promotion of harmony and tranquility in society. The escalating presence of hate speech specifically
targeting Islam or Muslim communities on online discussion platforms is a growing concern. This
form of hate speech not only fosters an environment of intolerance and hostility but can also have
severe psychological impacts on individuals and communities, leading to real-world violence and
discrimination.
To address this issue, researchers have increasingly turned to advanced technologies; using text-
processing approaches in AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are frequently employed
for hate speech detection, with some offering severity assessment of hate speech. These methods
utilize sophisticated algorithms to analyse vast amounts of textual data, identifying patterns and
features indicative of hate speech. For instance, deep learning models, like recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), can learn complex representations of text data, enabling them to detect subtle and context-
dependent instances of hate speech. Modern NLP techniques, on the other hand, can enhance these
models by providing richer linguistic insights. Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named
entity recognition are just a few NLP techniques that help in breaking down and understanding the
text’s structure and meaning. Moreover, the integration of latest NLP model and transformers, like
BERT and GPT, has significantly improved the ability of models to understand context, sarcasm, and
implicit hate speech, which are often challenging to detect. Another interesting approach is to use
human-centric perspectives of AI using some benchmark dataset.
Researchers have tried to employ GNNs in hate speech classification, but still needs more focus
on this area. Despite their potential, GNNs have not been actively employed for the purpose of
interpretable identification of hate speech, particularly in Islamic contexts. Islamophobic content
often exhibits close word choices and hate speakers from the same community, which GNNs can
leverage to reveal and explain patterns, alongside impressive classification scores.
A novel approach employing graph neural networks for the identification and explication of hate
speech directed at Islam (XG-HSI) is introduced. The dataset is pre-processed to focus on Islamic
contexts, utilize pretrained NLP models for word embeddings, establish connections between texts,
and employ a series of graph encoders for hate speech target identification, which achieves state-of-
the-art performance.

Background
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful neural networks designed for processing non-Euclidean
data organized in complex, interconnected graphs. Using their ability to utilize relations between
different data points, GNNs have shown tremendous promise in text classification and detection
tasks. GNNs have the ability to enhance hate speech detection on social media by modeling complex
relationships between users and content, capturing contextual information from interactions. They
propagate information across the network, identifying coordinated and evolving hate speech patterns.
We also present a case study in Section 5 to illustrate how incorporating related information enhances
the process.
A general bag of words-based approach to create graphs, without LLMs is adopted. By integrating
with pretrained NLP models, GNNs leverage contextual word embeddings to better understand the
subtleties of hate speech. This combined approach improves the accuracy, context-awareness, and
adaptability of detection systems, making them more effective in identifying hate speech directed at
Islam and potentially generalizing to other targeted groups.

Methodology
3.1
Notations
Let a graph G = (V, E, X), where V represents nodes, E denotes edges. We also define N and M as the
numbers of nodes and edges, respectively. Each node v is associated with a feature xi ˘2208 RF , and
the node feature matrix for the entire graph is denoted as X ˘2208 RN ˘00d7F , where F represents the
feature vector length. In our approach, each content denotes a node, contextual similarity between
two nodes is denoted by an edge and word embeddings are node features of the graph. The task
involves a node classification task to detect hate speech and Islamophobic content.
3.2
Data Pre-Processing
Initially, the dataset was filtered to focus on hate speech targeting Islam. Next, pretrained NLP models
is applied to the text to obtain word embeddings X as node features for all nodes V. Edges E are
determined using cosine similarity between embeddings with a threshold of 0.725. Subsequently,
GNN is applied for the classification task.
3.3
Graph Encoder
After data pre-processing, every data point x ˘2282 X undergoes a series of transformations to get
output p. First, it is processed by a linear layer producing x1 (Equation 1).
x1 = Wx + b
(1)
Subsequently, x1 is passed into two initial graph encoders to aggregate neighborhood information,
feature extraction, and yield x2, x3 utilizing G and concatenated to x23 (Equation 2,3, 4). Here in
Equation 2, we aggregate features from a node’s local neighborhood, to learn different characteristics.
In Equation 3 and 4, we use a semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data, employing an
efficient variant of convolutional neural networks that operate directly on graphs.
x2 = W1x1 + W2 · meanj∈N(i)x1
(2)
x3 = W1x1 + ˆAx1
(3)
2
x23 = concat(x2, x3)
(4)
Here, N is the set of neighbouring nodes. Following this, x23 is passed through another graph layer
employing attention-based feature extraction, utilizing masked self-attentional layers to implicitly
assign different weights to nodes in a neighbourhood, producing x4 (Equation 5 and 6).
x4 = αi,iΘx23i +

αi,j =
exp(LeakyReLU(aT [Θx23i||Θx23j]))
P
k∈N(i) exp(LeakyReLU(aT [Θx23i||Θx23k]))
(6)
Here, ˘03b8 refers to trainable model weights. ˘03b1 is the attention value, calculated by the equation
mentioned.
Finally, x4 is passed through a final linear layer to obtain logits pl, which are then subjected to a
softmax operation to derive probabilities p (Equation 7 amd 8).
xc = concat(x1, x4); pl = Wxc + b
(7)
p = softmax(pl)

Cross Entropy loss is designed to minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and
true values, as follows:

Graph Explanation
GNNExplainer is used to derive explanations from the graph encoder network for interpreting the
results and find underlying relations and causation. It works by taking a trained GNN model and
its predictions as input, and returns explanations in the form of compact subgraph structures and
subsets of influential node features. This model-agnostic approach can explain predictions of any
GNN-based model on various graph-based machine learning tasks, including node classification,
link prediction, and graph classification. GNNExplainer formulates explanations as rich subgraphs
of the input graph, maximizing mutual information with the GNN’s predictions. It achieves this
by employing a mean field variational approximation to learn real-valued graph masks that select
important subgraphs and feature masks that highlight crucial node features. Through this process,
GNNExplainer offers insights into the underlying reasoning of GNN predictions, enhancing model
interpretability and facilitating error analysis.

Experimental Setup
Dataset. HateXplain, a benchmark hate speech dataset designed for addressing bias and interpretabil-
ity is used. The dataset has hate speech targets labelled. This labelling is used to collect only
Muslim-focused sentences and created a subset to work on this project. A 6:2:2 train, validation and
test split is used.
Baselines. The baseline models are: CNN-GRU, BiRNN, BiRNN-HateXplain, BERT, BERT-
HateXplain. Mentioned HateXplain-based models are fine-tuned on HateXplain dataset.

trained BERT (bert-base-uncased) and BiRNN. The model is trained for 200 epochs with a learning
rate of 0.001, using Adam optimizer. The experimental results in Table 1 show that our model achieves
remarkable performance comparing to benchmarks with explaining occurring phenomenons.We
utilized a single layer for each type of GNN, with a maximum tokenization length of 512 in the
tokenizer and length of BERT embeddings (F ) set to 128.

Macro F1 metrics. Traditional models like CNN-GRU and BiRNN show lower performance, with
BiRNN-HateXplain offering slight improvements. BERT-based models perform better, particularly
BERT-HateXplain. However, our proposed models, XG-HSI-BiRNN and XG-HSI-BERT, signifi-
cantly outperform all others, with XG-HSI-BERT achieving the highest accuracy (0.741) and Macro

speech detection.

Graph Explanation Case Study
For a given post, ""How is all that awesome Muslim diversity going for you native germans? You
have allowed this yourselves. If you do not stand and fight against this. You get what you asked for
what you deserve!"", the predicted classification was offensive towards Islam. As per the explainer,
the neighbouring and self-tokens helped to classify this as offensive to Muslims are fight, Muslim
diversity, brooks, rish, donald, syrian, schultz, typed. The text’s association of ""Muslim diversity""
with potential blame and its confrontational tone in phrases like ""stand and fight against this,""
combined with neighbouring tokens like syrians, brooks, syrians denoted negative sentiment.

Discussion
This study not only addresses the immediate challenge of identifying and explaining hate speech
directed at Islam but also recognizes the broader impact of hate speech propagation on online
platforms. The proliferation of Islamophobic language fosters intolerance, division, and hostility
within communities, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and prejudices. By leveraging GNNs in our
XG-HSI framework, we not only detect hate speech but also provide explanations for its occurrence,
shedding light on the underlying factors driving such behaviour. GNNs excel in capturing complex
relationships and patterns within data, enabling them to effectively identify instances of hate speech
and elucidate the contextual nuances surrounding them. By leveraging the inherent structure of social
networks and textual data, our approach offers a comprehensive understanding of how hate speech
propagates in online discourse.
In future research, exploring the integration of multimodal data sources, such as images and videos,
could enhance the robustness of hate speech detection models, particularly in detecting nuanced
forms of Islamophobic content. Additionally, investigating the dynamic nature of online communities
and incorporating temporal aspects into GNN architectures could provide deeper insights into the
evolution of hate speech propagation and enable more proactive interventions to counter its spread.

Conclusion
Identifying and addressing Islamophobic hatred on social media is crucial for achieving harmony
and peace. This research presents a novel method using GNNs to detect hate speech towards Islam.
Empirical findings demonstrate that our model achieves exceptional performance, significantly
outperforming all others, with XG-HSI-BERT achieving the highest accuracy (0.741) and Macro F1
(0.747). Explainability aspect of this approach is also very promising, as it provides insights into
both correlations and causation. This further highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online
hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.
Limitations
The limitations include the use of only one dataset, which, while sufficient for this initial exploration,
should be expanded upon in future research to validate and extend our findings. Additionally, while
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to be computationally intensive, especially with large-
scale datasets, the relatively limited number of hate speech keywords suggests that GNNs may still
be highly effective. Furthermore, more efficient GNN training methods are now available, which
address some of the computational challenges in future applications.
Ethical Implications
Our work on using GNNs to detect hate speech targeting Islam carries significant ethical responsibili-
ties. We focus on minimizing biases in the model to ensure fair treatment of all groups, emphasizing
the need for transparency in how the model arrives at its decisions. By using interpretable GNN
methods, we strive to provide clear explanations for the model’s classifications, allowing for greater
accountability. We also acknowledge the potential risks of misuse and take steps to prevent these,
adhering to ethical guidelines that respect privacy and avoid unjust censorship.
Societal Implications
The societal impact lies in its potential to create a safer online environment by effectively identifying
and mitigating Islamophobic content. By enhancing the detection accuracy and providing clear
explanations for the identified hate speech, our model contributes to fostering more inclusive and
respectful online communities. Additionally, our work highlights the importance of combating digital
hate speech, which can lead to real-world harm. We aim to empower platforms and policymakers
with tools that uphold freedom of expression while curbing harmful rhetoric, thus promoting social
harmony and understanding.
Potential Risks
The application of our model presents several risks. One major concern is the potential for model
misclassification, which could lead to false positives or negatives, impacting users unfairly. Addition-
ally, there is a risk of over-reliance on automated systems, which might not capture nuanced contexts
and could inadvertently suppress legitimate speech. Annotation errors can also induce bias, but as
we used a previously peer-reviewed benchmark dataset, we hope those type of concerns are already
addressed.

P016.pdf,"A Bayesian Perspective on Cross-Cultural Morality:
Investigating Astrobiological and Cognitive
Dimensions
Abstract
Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy explores the potential for
meaningful interactions with extraterrestrial civilizations by integrating Bayesian
inference and theological inquiry. This novel approach establishes a probabilistic
framework to evaluate the compatibility of ethical systems across planetary cultures,
focusing on shared moral frameworks as the foundation for interstellar diplomacy.
By combining Bayesian analysis with philosophical perspectives, the study aims
to uncover common moral structures that could enable cooperative and mutually
beneficial relationships.
The framework draws insights from diverse disciplines like astrobiology, exopale-
ontology, and extremophile studies to predict moral systems influenced by varied
environmental conditions. Bayesian models applied to hypothetical alien encoun-
ters systematically evaluate risks, benefits, and strategic protocols for interspecies
diplomacy.
This interdisciplinary research also examines the nature of morality and its role in
interspecies communication. The inclusion of theological perspectives enriches the
analysis, offering a multifaceted exploration of ethical implications in intergalactic
contexts. Ultimately, this study pushes the boundaries of interdisciplinary inquiry,
providing a rigorous, nuanced framework for addressing the moral complexities of
interstellar cooperation while challenging our assumptions about humanity’s place
in the universe.

Introduction
The pursuit of understanding the intricacies of extra-terrestrial life and its potential implications
on human society has long been a topic of fascination and debate. As we continue to advance in
our search for life beyond Earth, it is becoming increasingly evident that the discovery of alien
civilizations could have profound effects on our collective worldview, challenging our existing
beliefs and moral frameworks. In light of this, it is essential to consider the role of Bayesian
theology in facilitating a deeper understanding of the potential for shared moral frameworks with
alien civilizations. By employing Bayesian inference, we can systematically analyze the likelihood
of encountering extraterrestrial life that adheres to a similar moral compass as humanity, thereby
enabling more effective and meaningful diplomatic interactions.
The concept of a shared moral framework is inherently complex, as it relies on a multitude of factors,
including the aliens’ cognitive abilities, cultural background, and environmental influences. Moreover,
the possibility of encountering a civilization with a completely disparate moral framework raises
questions about the universality of ethical principles and the potential for intergalactic cooperation.
It is within this context that Bayesian theology emerges as a vital tool, allowing us to quantify the
uncertainty associated with these encounters and subsequently inform our diplomatic strategies.
One approach to tackling this problem involves the development of a moral framework taxonomy,
which would categorize various ethical systems based on their underlying principles and values. This
taxonomy could then be used to construct a Bayesian network, enabling the inference of probability
distributions over the possible moral frameworks that an alien civilization might adhere to. However,
this approach is not without its challenges, as it relies on a deeper understanding of the moral and
philosophical underpinnings of human civilization, as well as the potential for alternative moral
frameworks that may be incomprehensible to humanity.
An alternative, albeit unconventional, approach to this problem involves the application of Jungian
analytical psychology, which posits the existence of a collective unconscious that transcends human
culture and experience. According to this perspective, certain archetypes and moral principles may
be universally shared across the cosmos, providing a common foundation for intergalactic diplomacy.
This idea is supported by the premise that many human myths and legends contain themes and motifs
that are eerily similar, despite being developed in isolation from one another. It is possible that
these shared archetypes may serve as a cosmic moral lingua franca, facilitating communication and
cooperation between human and alien civilizations.
Furthermore, recent advances in the field of astrobiology have led to a greater understanding of the
conditions necessary for life to emerge and thrive on other planets. The discovery of exoplanets with
environments similar to those of Earth has sparked hope that we may soon encounter life beyond
our solar system. However, this also raises questions about the potential for moral frameworks to
evolve in response to different environmental pressures. For instance, a civilization that develops on
a planet with scarce resources may be more likely to adopt a utilitarian moral framework, whereas a
civilization that evolves in a resource-rich environment may be more inclined towards a deontological
approach.
In addition to these considerations, it is also essential to examine the potential implications of
encountering an alien civilization with a moral framework that is fundamentally at odds with our
own. This could lead to a range of complex diplomatic and ethical dilemmas, as humanity would be
forced to confront the possibility that its own moral assumptions may not be universal. Moreover,
the encounter could also raise questions about the nature of morality itself, challenging our existing
understanding of right and wrong and potentially leading to a reevaluation of human values and
principles.
The integration of Bayesian theology and astrobiology also raises interesting questions about the
potential for a ""moral cosmology,"" which would seek to understand the underlying moral principles
that govern the universe. This could involve the development of a new field of study, one that
combines insights from theology, philosophy, and astrobiology to provide a deeper understanding of
the cosmos and our place within it. By exploring the moral implications of astrobiological discoveries,
we may uncover new avenues for inquiry and new perspectives on the human condition, ultimately
leading to a more nuanced and informed approach to intergalactic diplomacy.
Moreover, the prospect of encountering alien civilizations with disparate moral frameworks also
prompts us to reexamine our own moral assumptions and the values that underlie human society.
This could involve a critical evaluation of our existing moral principles, as well as an exploration
of alternative ethical systems that may be more conducive to intergalactic cooperation. Ultimately,
the development of a Bayesian theological framework for extra-terrestrial diplomacy will require a
multidisciplinary approach, one that draws on insights from theology, philosophy, astrobiology, and
economics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex moral and ethical issues at play.
The application of Bayesian inference to the problem of inferring shared moral frameworks with alien
civilizations also raises intriguing questions about the nature of probability and uncertainty in the
context of intergalactic diplomacy. By quantifying the uncertainty associated with these encounters,
we may uncover new insights into the potential for cooperation and conflict, as well as the moral and
ethical implications of our actions. This could involve the development of new probabilistic models
and algorithms, ones that are specifically designed to address the unique challenges and uncertainties
of intergalactic diplomacy.
In conclusion, the exploration of Bayesian theology and its application to extra-terrestrial diplomacy
represents a fascinating and complex area of inquiry, one that challenges our existing understanding
of morality, ethics, and the cosmos. As we continue to advance in our search for life beyond Earth, it
is essential that we develop a deeper understanding of the potential for shared moral frameworks with
alien civilizations, and that we establish a framework for intergalactic diplomacy that is informed
by a nuanced and multifaceted approach to morality and ethics. By doing so, we may uncover new
2
avenues for cooperation and mutual understanding, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and
peaceful universe.

Related Work
The concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy is a multifaceted and interdisciplinary
field that has garnered significant attention in recent years. At its core, this field seeks to develop a
probabilistic framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human
and alien civilizations. This endeavor is inherently complex, as it requires an integration of insights
from theology, astrobiology, philosophy, and diplomacy, among other disciplines.
One of the foundational challenges in this field is the development of a rigorous methodology for
inferring the probability of shared moral frameworks. This requires a deep understanding of the
philosophical and theological underpinnings of human morality, as well as a willingness to consider
the possibility of alternative moral frameworks that may be employed by alien civilizations. Some
researchers have proposed the use of Bayesian inference techniques, which provide a probabilistic
framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. However, the application of these techniques
to the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still in its infancy, and significant work remains to be
done in order to develop a robust and reliable methodology.
In addition to the methodological challenges, there are also significant theoretical and conceptual
hurdles that must be overcome. For example, the concept of morality is often closely tied to the
specific cultural and historical context of a given civilization. As such, it is possible that alien
civilizations may possess moral frameworks that are fundamentally incompatible with our own.
This raises important questions about the potential for moral relativism, and the extent to which
human morality can be considered universal. Some researchers have argued that the discovery of
extraterrestrial life could challenge our current understanding of morality, and potentially lead to a
re-evaluation of our values and principles.
Despite these challenges, there have been several notable attempts to develop a framework for
understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. One
approach that has garnered significant attention is the use of game theoretical models, which provide
a mathematical framework for analyzing the strategic interactions between different agents. These
models have been used to study a wide range of scenarios, from the evolution of cooperation to the
emergence of conflict. However, their application to the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still
highly speculative, and significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable
framework for predicting the behavior of alien civilizations.
Another approach that has been proposed is the use of anthropological and sociological insights
to understand the potential for shared moral frameworks. This approach recognizes that human
morality is shaped by a complex array of cultural, historical, and environmental factors, and seeks to
identify potential parallels and analogies with alien civilizations. For example, some researchers have
argued that the emergence of complex social structures and cooperative behaviors in certain animal
species may provide insights into the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and
alien civilizations. However, this approach is still highly speculative, and significant work remains to
be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for
shared moral frameworks.
In a bizarre and unexpected twist, some researchers have also proposed the use of psychedelic
substances as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien
civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that psychedelic substances can alter human perception
and consciousness in ways that may facilitate a deeper understanding of alternative moral frameworks
and modes of cognition. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant
attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means
of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations.
Furthermore, the concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also raises important
questions about the potential for moral and ethical implications of encountering alien civilizations.
For example, if we were to encounter an alien civilization that possesses a fundamentally incompatible
moral framework, would we be morally obligated to attempt to communicate and understand their
3
perspective, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own moral and ethical principles? These are
complex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis.
In addition, the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also
raises important questions about the concept of universal morality. If we were to discover that certain
moral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence
for the existence of a universal moral law, or would it simply reflect the fact that certain moral
principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These are important questions,
and ones that require careful consideration and analysis.
Moreover, the field of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also intersects with the field
of astrobiology, which seeks to understand the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the universe. The
discovery of exoplanets and the detection of biosignatures in the atmospheres of certain planets have
provided significant evidence for the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the universe. However, the
existence of life does not necessarily imply the existence of intelligent life, or the potential for shared
moral frameworks. As such, significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and
reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and
alien civilizations.
The potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also raises important
questions about the concept of morality and its relationship to the universe. For example, if we were
to discover that certain moral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would
this provide evidence for the existence of a moral law that is inherent in the universe itself, or would
it simply reflect the fact that certain moral principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range
of contexts? These are important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis.
Additionally, the field of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also intersects with the field
of philosophy, which seeks to understand the nature of reality and our place within it. The potential for
shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations raises important questions about the
nature of morality and its relationship to the universe. For example, if we were to discover that certain
moral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence
for the existence of a moral law that is inherent in the universe itself, or would it simply reflect the
fact that certain moral principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These
are important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis.
In another unexpected turn, some researchers have also proposed the use of fringe sciences, such as
ufology and cryptozoology, as a means of understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks
between human and alien civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that these fields may provide
insights into the potential for alternative forms of life and consciousness that may exist elsewhere in
the universe. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and
interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating
communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations.
The potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also raises important
questions about the concept of cultural relativism. If we were to encounter an alien civilization
that possesses a fundamentally incompatible moral framework, would we be morally obligated to
attempt to understand and respect their perspective, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own
moral and ethical principles? These are complex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful
consideration and analysis.
In a surprising development, some researchers have also proposed the use of artificial intelligence
as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations.
The idea behind this approach is that artificial intelligence may provide a means of transcending the
limitations of human language and cognition, and facilitating a deeper understanding of alternative
moral frameworks and modes of cognition. While this approach is still highly speculative, it has
garnered significant attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel
and innovative means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien
civilizations.
The potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also intersects with
the field of diplomacy, which seeks to understand the potential for cooperation and conflict between
different nations and civilizations. The discovery of extraterrestrial life could potentially lead to a
fundamentally new era of diplomacy, as human civilizations seek to navigate the complexities of
4
interspecies communication and cooperation. However, this would also raise important questions
about the potential for moral and ethical implications of encountering alien civilizations, and the need
for a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks.
In a bizarre and unexpected tangent, some researchers have also proposed the use ofCrop circles as a
means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The
idea behind this approach is that crop circles may provide a means of non-verbal communication, and
facilitate a deeper understanding of alternative moral frameworks and modes of cognition. While
this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and interest in certain
quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating communication
and understanding between human and alien civilizations.
The concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy is a complex and multifaceted
field that requires an integration of insights from theology, astrobiology, philosophy, and diplomacy,
among other disciplines. While significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous
and reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human
and alien civilizations, the potential rewards are significant. The discovery of extraterrestrial life
could potentially lead to a fundamentally new era of cooperation and understanding between human
and alien civilizations, and could provide important insights into the nature of morality and its
relationship to the universe. As such, continued research and exploration in this field is essential, and
may potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities and mysteries of the universe.
Furthermore, it is also essential to consider the potential implications of encountering alien civiliza-
tions that possess advanced technologies and capabilities. For example, if an alien civilization were to
possess technology that is significantly more advanced than our own, would we be morally obligated
to attempt to learn from them and adapt their technologies, or would we be justified in prioritizing
our own technological development and autonomy? These are complex and difficult questions, and
ones that require careful consideration and analysis.

Methodology
To develop a comprehensive framework for Bayesian Theology in the context of Extra-Terrestrial
Diplomacy, we first established a foundational understanding of the theological and philosophical
underpinnings of moral frameworks across potential alien civilizations. This involved an exhaustive
review of terrestrial religious and ethical systems, seeking commonalities and divergences that
could inform our hypotheses about extraterrestrial moralities. We hypothesized that any civilization
advanced enough to communicate with us would have grappled with similar fundamental questions
regarding the nature of existence, the balance between individual and collective well-being, and the
role of altruism versus self-preservation.
A critical component of our methodology was the development of a novel Bayesian inference engine,
which we term ""Xenothetic Inference Module"" (XIM). The XIM is designed to integrate disparate data
streams, including but not limited to: astrobiological findings, the spectral analysis of exoplanetary
atmospheres, patterns in celestial mechanics that could indicate the presence of megastructures,
and even the detection of mathematical or linguistic patterns in purported alien transmissions. By
continuously updating its probabilistic models based on new evidence, the XIM aims to estimate the
likelihood of encountering civilizations with moral frameworks that overlap with our own, facilitating
more effective and ethical communication strategies.
In an unexpected turn, our research also explored the potential application of quantum entanglement as
a means of interstellar communication that could bypass traditional limitations imposed by the speed
of light. Theoretically, entangled particles could serve as a conduit for instantaneous information
exchange, regardless of spatial separation. This led us down a fascinating, albeit highly speculative,
path considering the implications of quantum non-locality on the nature of interstellar morality and
cooperation. We posited that civilizations capable of harnessing entanglement for communication
might develop unique ethical perspectives, given the fundamentally non-local character of their
interconnectedness.
Furthermore, our team conducted an extensive survey of science fiction literature and cinema,
analyzing depictions of alien civilizations and their moral structures. This may seem unconventional,
but we reasoned that speculative fiction often serves as a reflection of human hopes, fears, and
5
philosophical introspections about our place in the universe. By examining the diversity of imagined
extraterrestrial societies and their ethical dilemmas, we aimed to catalog a wide range of possible
moral frameworks that could exist elsewhere in the universe. This approach, termed ""narrative
anthropology,"" allowed us to consider scenarios that might not be immediately apparent through
more traditional scientific or theological inquiry.
Moreover, we invested significant effort into developing a taxonomy of potential alien value sys-
tems, categorizing them based on their putative ethical, utilitarian, deontological, or virtue-based
orientations. This classification scheme, while not exhaustive, provided a structured framework for
predicting how different types of civilizations might interact with humanity, based on their inferred
moral principles. An intriguing outcome of this work was the realization that certain forms of alien
life, particularly those with collective or hive-minded consciousness, might adopt moral frameworks
that are incommensurable with human ethical discourse, challenging our assumptions about the
universality of moral values.
In a bold, albeit somewhat unorthodox, move, our research team also collaborated with a group of
experimental artists to create an ""interstellar moral probe"" – a transcendent, symbolic representation
of human ethics and values embedded within a cosmic ray-based transmission. The rationale behind
this artistic endeavor was to explore the boundaries of moral expression and recognition across vastly
different cultural and biological contexts. By broadcasting an essence of human morality into the
cosmos, we hoped to stimulate a form of ""moral resonance"" that could, in theory, be detected or
responded to by civilizations attuned to similar ethical frequencies.
Through these multifaceted approaches, our study endeavored to bridge the gap between the scientific
pursuit of extraterrestrial life and the philosophical exploration of moral universalism. By synthesizing
insights from theology, ethics, astrobiology, and quantum mechanics, we sought to illuminate the
intricate, uncharted landscape of interstellar morality, navigating toward a deeper understanding of
the shared moral frameworks that might unite intelligent life across the cosmos. Ultimately, our
methodology, though eclectic and provocative, underscores the profound complexity and richness of
exploring the moral dimensions of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

Experiments
In an effort to operationalize the conceptual framework of Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial
Diplomacy, a series of experiments were conducted to infer the probability of shared moral frame-
works with alien civilizations. The methodology employed a multi-faceted approach, incorporating
elements of astrobiology, cognitive psychology, and philosophical theology. Initially, a comprehen-
sive review of existing literature on the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and the Zoo Hypothesis
was undertaken to contextualize the research within the broader discourse of extraterrestrial life
and its potential implications for human society. This was supplemented by an exhaustive analy-
sis of mythological and theological narratives from diverse cultural traditions, seeking to identify
commonalities and divergences in the moral and ethical frameworks underpinning these stories.
To further ground the research in empirical data, a mixed-methods survey was administered to a
sample of 10,000 individuals, representing a cross-section of the global population in terms of
demographic variables such as age, gender, geographical location, and socio-economic status. The
survey instrument consisted of a combination of Likert scale questions, open-ended prompts, and a
novel ""Moral Dilemma Resolution"" task, which presented participants with a series of hypothetical
scenarios involving conflicts between individual rights and collective well-being, and asked them to
provide narrative responses detailing their decision-making processes. The data generated from this
survey were then subjected to a Bayesian analysis, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulations to estimate the posterior distributions of parameters representing the probability of shared
moral values among humans and, by extension, potentially among alien civilizations.
An unexpected tangent emerged during the data collection phase, as a subgroup of participants began
to report experiences of ""moral downloading,"" whereby they claimed to have received intuitive insights
into the moral frameworks of hypothetical alien civilizations. These reports were characterized by
a sense of immediacy and certainty, with participants often describing the experience as akin to
accessing a collective unconscious or tapping into a cosmic reservoir of moral knowledge. While
these claims were not anticipated at the outset of the study, they were nonetheless incorporated into
6
the analysis, with a separate MCMC model developed to estimate the probability of such ""moral
downloading"" events occurring within the context of human-alien interactions.
A bizarre approach was also adopted in the form of a ""simulated alien encounter"" protocol, wherein
participants were immersed in a virtual reality environment designed to mimic the conditions of
a hypothetical first contact scenario. Within this virtual environment, participants were presented
with a series of moral dilemmas tailored to the specific context of interstellar relations, such as the
management of resources, the resolution of conflicts, and the balancing of individual freedoms with
collective security. The responses generated by participants during these simulated encounters were
then analyzed using a combination of natural language processing and thematic analysis, aiming to
identify patterns and themes that could inform the development of a shared moral framework for
human-alien diplomacy.
In an effort to further validate the findings, a table was constructed to summarize the results of the
survey and the simulated alien encounter protocol, as shown below: The estimates presented in this

table suggest that, while there may be some degree of overlap in the moral values held by humans
and hypothetical alien civilizations, there are also significant discrepancies and uncertainties that
must be accounted for in the development of a shared moral framework for interstellar diplomacy.
Furthermore, the inclusion of ""moral downloading"" events in the analysis appears to have introduced
a degree of instability into the estimates, highlighting the need for further research into the nature and
implications of such phenomena.
The experiments also involved an examination of the role of ritual and symbolism in facilitating
human-alien communication and cooperation. A series of ""inter Species Rituals"" were designed and
implemented, incorporating elements of music, dance, and visual art to convey moral and ethical
principles in a universally intelligible language. The results of these experiments were mixed, with
some participants reporting a sense of profound connection and understanding with the hypothetical
alien entities, while others experienced confusion, disorientation, or even a sense of moral outrage.
These findings underscore the complexity and unpredictability of interstellar relations, and highlight
the need for a nuanced and multi-faceted approach to the development of a shared moral framework
for human-alien diplomacy.
In addition to these experimental protocols, a range of secondary analyses were conducted to explore
the implications of the research for our understanding of the human condition and the potential
for moral growth and evolution in the context of interstellar relations. These analyses involved
the application of theoretical frameworks from fields such as cognitive science, anthropology, and
philosophy, and aimed to shed light on the deeper structural and existential implications of the research
findings. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections, and are intended to
contribute to a broader conversation about the nature and significance of Bayesian Theology for
Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy.

Results
The investigation into the probability of shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations has yielded
a plethora of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced and multifaceted examination. Initially, our
research endeavors focused on establishing a foundational framework for Bayesian inference in the
context of interstellar diplomacy. This involved the development of a novel probabilistic model,
herein referred to as the ""Interstellar Moral Alignment"" (IMA) model, which seeks to quantify the
likelihood of convergent moral values between human and extraterrestrial civilizations.
7
The IMA model is predicated on the assumption that the emergence of complex life and, subsequently,
moral frameworks, is influenced by a combination of universal principles and contingent factors.
By integrating insights from astrophysics, astrobiology, and the philosophy of morality, we have
endeavored to create a comprehensive and adaptable framework for predicting the probability of
shared moral values. Notably, our model incorporates an innovative ""Moral Similarity Index"" (MSI),
which serves as a quantitative metric for evaluating the degree of congruence between disparate moral
systems.
To facilitate a more robust understanding of the IMA model’s predictive capabilities, we conducted
an extensive series of simulations, incorporating a diverse range of parameters and initial conditions.
These simulations revealed a fascinating pattern of results, wherein the predicted probability of shared
moral frameworks exhibited a non-linear relationship with the distance between civilizations. Specifi-
cally, our findings suggest that the likelihood of convergent moral values increases exponentially as
the distance between civilizations decreases, up to a critical threshold of approximately 10 parsecs.
Beyond this threshold, the predicted probability undergoes a precipitous decline, implying that the
emergence of shared moral frameworks is highly sensitive to the proximity of civilizations.
Furthermore, our research has also explored the intriguing possibility of ""moral harmonic resonance,""
wherein the collective moral values of multiple civilizations become synchronized, giving rise to a
harmonious and cohesive interstellar moral framework. This phenomenon is hypothesized to occur
when the MSI values of participating civilizations exceed a critical threshold, thereby facilitating
the emergence of a unified and shared moral perspective. While the existence of moral harmonic
resonance remains purely speculative at this juncture, our simulations suggest that it could potentially
play a pivotal role in shaping the moral landscape of the galaxy, particularly in regions with high
densities of intelligent life.
In addition to these findings, our investigation has also uncovered a range of unexpected and seemingly
anomalous results, which challenge our current understanding of Bayesian inference in the context
of interstellar diplomacy. For instance, our simulations have revealed that the incorporation of
""quantum fluctuations"" into the IMA model can significantly enhance the predicted probability of
shared moral frameworks, particularly in scenarios where civilizations are separated by vast distances.
This phenomenon, which we have termed ""quantum moral entanglement,"" appears to be linked to the
non-local correlations between particles and has significant implications for our understanding of the
interplay between morality and the fundamental laws of physics.
To further elucidate the complex relationships between these variables, we have constructed a
comprehensive table summarizing the key results of our simulations, as shown below:

The data presented in this table highlights the complex interplay between variables such as distance,

mechanisms governing the emergence of shared moral frameworks. Moreover, the occurrence of
quantum moral entanglement in certain simulations serves as a poignant reminder of the profound
and unsettling implications of quantum mechanics for our understanding of reality, and the need for a
more nuanced and interdisciplinary approach to the study of interstellar diplomacy.
In conclusion, our research has yielded a rich tapestry of results, replete with unexpected twists
and tantalizing prospects for future investigation. The IMA model, with its incorporated MSI and
quantum fluctuations, has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for predicting the probability of shared
moral frameworks, while the phenomenon of moral harmonic resonance offers a compelling vision
of a harmonious and unified interstellar moral landscape. As we continue to explore the vast expanse
of the galaxy, it is our hope that this research will contribute meaningfully to the development of
8
a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between intelligent
life, morality, and the cosmos. Ultimately, the pursuit of knowledge in this domain is driven by
an insatiable curiosity regarding the nature of existence and our place within the grand tapestry of
the universe, and it is our sincere belief that the continued exploration of these themes will yield a
profound and lasting impact on the trajectory of human civilization.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our exploration of Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy has yielded a
plethora of intriguing insights into the potential for shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations.
Through the application of Bayesian inference, we have developed a novel framework for assessing
the probability of convergent moral values amongst extraterrestrial intelligences. This approach has
facilitated a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between moral philosophy, astrobiology,
and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Our research has far-reaching implications for the
field of astrodiplomacy, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates
philosophical, theological, and scientific perspectives.
One of the most significant contributions of our study is the introduction of the concept of ""moral
mirror symmetry,"" which posits that the probability of shared moral values between two civilizations
is directly proportional to the degree of symmetry between their respective moral frameworks. This
concept has been shown to be remarkably effective in predicting the likelihood of cooperation
and conflict between different civilizations, and has important implications for the development of
strategies for interstellar diplomacy. Furthermore, our research has also explored the possibility of
using Bayesian inference to identify ""moral anomalies"" - instances where the observed behavior of
an alien civilization deviates significantly from the predicted moral framework. These anomalies may
hold the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of the moral and philosophical underpinnings of
extraterrestrial cultures.
In a surprising twist, our analysis has also revealed a fascinating connection between the probability
of shared moral frameworks and the presence of certain types of celestial bodies in a given star system.
Specifically, we have found that the presence of a gas giant planet in the habitable zone of a star is
strongly correlated with a increased probability of shared moral values amongst the intelligent species
inhabiting that system. This phenomenon, which we have dubbed the ""Jupiter Effect,"" has significant
implications for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and suggests that the presence of gas giant
planets may be an important factor in the development of complex life and moral systems.
Moreover, our study has also explored the possibility of using artificial intelligence and machine
learning algorithms to simulate the evolution of moral frameworks in alien civilizations. This
approach has allowed us to model the dynamics of moral development in a wide range of scenarios,
from the emergence of simple moral codes in primitive societies to the complex moral philosophies
of advanced civilizations. One of the most interesting results of this research is the discovery of
a ""moral singularity"" - a point at which the moral framework of an alien civilization becomes so
complex and nuanced that it is effectively incomprehensible to human observers. This phenomenon
has significant implications for our understanding of the limits of moral knowledge and the potential
for mutual understanding between human and alien civilizations.
In addition to these findings, our research has also touched on a number of more speculative and
philosophical topics, including the possibility of a ""multiverse of moralities"" - a vast ensemble of
parallel universes, each with its own unique moral framework and set of moral principles. This
idea, while still highly speculative, has significant implications for our understanding of the nature
of morality and the human condition, and raises important questions about the potential for moral
diversity and convergence across the multiverse. Furthermore, our study has also explored the
possibility of using ""moral archeology"" - a technique for reconstructing the moral frameworks of
extinct civilizations through the analysis of archaeological and anthropological data. This approach
has allowed us to gain a unique insight into the moral and philosophical values of long-lost cultures,
and has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of human morality and the
development of complex societies.
Finally, our research has also highlighted the need for a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding
of the complex interplay between morality, culture, and technology in the context of astrodiplomacy.
As we continue to explore the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the potential for interstellar
9
cooperation and conflict, it is essential that we develop a deeper understanding of the moral and
philosophical principles that underlie the actions and decisions of alien civilizations. This will require
a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates insights from philosophy, theology, anthropology, and
a range of other disciplines, and will ultimately depend on our ability to develop a more nuanced and
empathetic understanding of the diverse range of moral and cultural perspectives that exist across the
universe. By pursuing this line of research, we may ultimately uncover new and innovative solutions
to the complex challenges of astrodiplomacy, and develop a more profound understanding of the
intricate web of moral and philosophical relationships that bind us to the stars.

P020.pdf,"Deep Learning for 3D Protein Structure Prediction in
Drug Discovery: A Novel Approach to Revolutionizing
Therapeutic agent Development
Abstract
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of protein structure prediction, enabling
the accurate modeling of complex biomolecules and facilitating breakthroughs
in drug discovery. This paper presents a novel approach to 3D protein structure
prediction, leveraging a bespoke ensemble of convolutional neural networks and
recurrent neural networks to capture the intricate relationships between amino
acid sequences and their corresponding 3D conformations. Notably, our methodol-
ogy incorporates an unconventional component: a generative model trained on a
dataset of protein structures inspired by the fractal patterns found in Romanesco
broccoli, which intuitively captures the self-similar properties of protein folds. By
integrating this unorthodox element, our model achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on benchmark datasets, while also demonstrating an unexpected capacity
for predicting protein structures that defy conventional notions of biochemical
plausibility, such as a predicted structure resembling a miniature replica of the
Eiffel Tower. These anomalous predictions, though seemingly aberrant, are posited
to represent previously unexplored regions of the protein structure universe, with
potential implications for the discovery of novel therapeutics and our fundamental
understanding of the universe itself.

Introduction
The prediction of 3D protein structures is a fundamental challenge in the field of structural biology,
with significant implications for drug discovery and development. Proteins are complex molecules
that perform a wide range of biological functions, and their three-dimensional structure is crucial
for understanding their behavior and interactions. However, determining the 3D structure of a
protein experimentally can be a time-consuming and costly process, making it essential to develop
computational methods that can accurately predict protein structures.
Recently, deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach for protein structure
prediction, leveraging large datasets of known protein structures to train neural networks that can
predict the 3D coordinates of amino acids in a protein. These methods have shown remarkable
accuracy in certain cases, but they are not without their limitations. For instance, some studies have
reported that deep learning models can be biased towards predicting structures that are similar to
those in the training dataset, rather than exploring the full range of possible conformations.
One intriguing approach that has been proposed to address this limitation is the use of generative
models to sample from the vast space of possible protein structures. This involves training a neural
network to generate new protein structures that are similar in structure and function to known proteins,
but with subtle variations that could potentially lead to new biological insights. Interestingly, some
researchers have even explored the use of chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor, to introduce
random fluctuations into the structure prediction process, with the goal of escaping local minima and
exploring more diverse regions of the conformational space.
Furthermore, the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction has also led to some
unexpected and bizarre discoveries. For example, one study found that a neural network trained to
predict protein structures could also be used to generate novel musical compositions, by mapping
the 3D coordinates of amino acids onto musical notes and rhythms. While this may seem like an
unrelated and even frivolous application, it highlights the remarkable flexibility and creativity of deep
learning models, and suggests that they may have a wider range of uses than initially anticipated.
In addition to their potential for predicting protein structures, deep learning models have also
been used to analyze and visualize the complex patterns and relationships that exist within protein
molecules. This has led to a new era of ""structural proteomics,"" in which researchers use com-
putational methods to analyze and compare the 3D structures of thousands of proteins, in order
to identify common themes and motifs that underlie their function and behavior. By exploring
the intricate networks and patterns that exist within protein molecules, researchers hope to gain a
deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie human disease, and to develop new
therapeutic strategies for treating a wide range of disorders.
Overall, the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction has opened up a new frontier in
structural biology, with significant implications for drug discovery and development. As researchers
continue to explore the potential of these methods, it is likely that we will see new and innovative
approaches emerge, some of which may seem unexpected or even bizarre, but which could ultimately
lead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of protein biology and function.

Related Work
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of 3D protein structure prediction, enabling accurate
modeling of complex molecular interactions that underlie various diseases. Recent studies have
demonstrated the efficacy of recurrent neural networks in predicting protein secondary structure,
while others have leveraged convolutional neural networks to identify functional sites on protein
surfaces. Notably, the application of generative adversarial networks has shown promise in generating
novel protein sequences with desired structural properties, potentially leading to the discovery of new
therapeutics.
One intriguing approach involves the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned
on smaller, disease-specific datasets to predict protein structures associated with particular pathologies.
This strategy has yielded impressive results, particularly in the context of amyloidogenic diseases,
where accurate structure prediction can inform the design of targeted therapies. Furthermore, the
incorporation of auxiliary information, such as protein-ligand binding affinities and gene expression
profiles, has enhanced the predictive power of these models, facilitating a more comprehensive
understanding of protein function and its relationship to disease.
In a surprising turn of events, researchers have also explored the application of protein structure
prediction to the field of xenobiology, where the goal is to design novel, non-natural proteins with
unique functional properties. This endeavor has led to the development of innovative algorithms that
can generate protein sequences capable of thriving in extreme environments, such as high-temperature
or high-pressure conditions. While the practical implications of this research are still unclear, it has
sparked interesting discussions about the potential for life on other planets and the possibility of
using protein engineering to create novel, extraterrestrial life forms.
Moreover, an unconventional approach has been proposed, which involves using protein structure
prediction as a means of generating musical compositions. By mapping protein sequences to musical
notes and using predicted structures to inform the composition of melodies, researchers have created
a novel form of protein-inspired music. Although this line of inquiry may seem unrelated to the field
of drug discovery, proponents argue that it can provide a unique window into the underlying patterns
and structures that govern protein function, potentially leading to new insights and innovations in the
field.
The use of reinforcement learning has also been explored, where agents are trained to navigate
complex protein landscapes and identify optimal structural configurations. This strategy has shown
promise in the context of protein-ligand binding, where the goal is to design small molecules that
can selectively target specific protein sites. By leveraging the power of reinforcement learning,
2
researchers have developed agents that can efficiently explore vast chemical spaces and identify novel
lead compounds with potential therapeutic applications.
Ultimately, the development of accurate and efficient methods for 3D protein structure prediction
remains an active area of research, with significant implications for the field of drug discovery.
As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, it is likely that we will see
the emergence of novel, innovative approaches that challenge our current understanding of protein
structure and function, and potentially lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of complex diseases.

Methodology
The development of deep learning models for 3D protein structure prediction has been a pivotal
aspect of advancing drug discovery. To tackle this complex problem, we employed a multi-faceted
approach, combining elements of computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement
learning. Our methodology commenced with the creation of a novel dataset, comprising protein
structures represented as 3D voxel grids, which were then translated into a musical composition. This
unorthodox approach allowed us to leverage the expressive power of music to capture the intricate
patterns and relationships inherent in protein structures.
The musical compositions were generated using a custom-designed algorithm, which assigned specific
notes and melodies to different amino acid sequences and structural motifs. These compositions
were then fed into a deep neural network, trained to predict the 3D structure of the protein based
on the musical representation. The network architecture consisted of a series of convolutional and
recurrent layers, which learned to identify patterns and relationships between the musical notes and
the corresponding protein structure.
In addition to this primary approach, we also explored the use of an auxiliary model, trained on
a dataset of protein structures paired with their corresponding smells. This model, dubbed the
""Olfactory Prophet,"" utilized a unique blend of natural language processing and machine learning to
predict the scent of a protein based on its structure. While this approach may seem unconventional,
our preliminary results suggest that the Olfactory Prophet is capable of capturing subtle patterns and
relationships in protein structures that are not immediately apparent through traditional methods.
To further augment our model, we incorporated a reinforcement learning component, which allowed
the network to explore different conformational spaces and discover novel protein structures. This
was achieved through the use of a custom-designed game environment, where the network was
rewarded for generating stable and biologically relevant structures. The game environment was
designed to simulate the challenges and complexities of real-world protein structure prediction, with
the network receiving feedback in the form of a ""protein fitness score"" that reflected the accuracy and
validity of its predictions.
Throughout the development of our methodology, we prioritized creativity and experimentation, often
venturing into uncharted territory and exploring unconventional approaches. While some of these
approaches may have seemed illogical or flawed at the outset, they ultimately contributed to a deeper
understanding of the complex relationships between protein structure, function, and prediction. Our
methodology serves as a testament to the power of innovative thinking and the importance of pushing
the boundaries of what is thought to be possible in the field of deep learning for 3D protein structure
prediction.

Experiments
To evaluate the effectiveness of our AI-assisted restoration approach, we conducted a series of
experiments on a dataset of medieval Gothic architectural structures. The dataset consisted of
500 images of various buildings, including cathedrals, churches, and castles, each with unique
architectural features and levels of deterioration. We divided the dataset into training and testing sets,
with 400 images used for training and 100 images used for testing.
Our approach utilized a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze
the images and predict the original architecture of the buildings. We employed a convolutional neural
network (CNN) to extract features from the images, which were then used to train a generative
model to produce restored versions of the buildings. The generative model was trained using a novel
3
loss function that took into account not only the visual similarity between the restored and original
buildings but also the historical and cultural context of the architecture.
In addition to the standard approach, we also explored the use of unconventional methods to enhance
the restoration process. One such approach involved using a swarm of drones equipped with tiny
chisels to physically carve out the restored architectural features from foam blocks. The drones were
programmed to work in tandem with the AI system, using the predicted architecture as a guide to
carve out the intricate details of the buildings. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it allowed
us to explore the potential of using robotic systems to physically realize the restored architecture.
We also investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) technology to immersive ourselves in the restored
buildings and gain a deeper understanding of the architectural features. By donning VR headsets
and navigating through the restored structures, we were able to identify subtle details and nuances
that may have been overlooked using traditional methods. This approach also allowed us to test the
restorations in a more engaging and interactive way, providing a more comprehensive understanding
of the buildings’ original architecture.
To quantify the performance of our approach, we used a range of metrics, including peak signal-
to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and a custom metric that evaluated the
historical accuracy of the restorations. The results showed that our approach outperformed existing
methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM, and achieved a high level of historical accuracy, with an
average score of 8.5 out of 10.
The following table summarizes the results of our experiments: Overall, our experiments demonstrated

Results
The implementation of our AI-assisted restoration framework yielded intriguing outcomes, particu-
larly in the realm of medieval Gothic architecture. By leveraging a unique blend of computer vision
and machine learning algorithms, our system was able to accurately identify and reconstruct damaged
or missing structural elements, such as vaulted ceilings, ribbed arches, and flying buttresses. Notably,
our approach incorporated an unconventional methodology, wherein the AI system was trained on
a dataset of Gothic architecture-inspired fractal patterns, which enabled it to develop a profound
understanding of the underlying geometric and aesthetic principles that govern these structures.
One of the most striking aspects of our results was the AI’s ability to generate novel, yet historically
consistent, designs for missing elements, such as intricate stone carvings, stained glass windows,
and ornate column capitals. These designs were not only visually stunning but also demonstrated
a remarkable degree of structural integrity, as verified through finite element analysis and other
simulation-based methods. Furthermore, our system’s capacity for adaptive learning allowed it to
incorporate feedback from human experts, thereby refining its restoration proposals and ensuring that
they aligned with the highest standards of historical authenticity and architectural coherence.
The results of our experiments are summarized in the following table, which highlights the perfor-
mance of our AI-assisted restoration framework across various evaluation metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and mean average precision. In addition to its technical merits, our AI-assisted
restoration framework also demonstrated a surprising ability to evoke emotional responses in human
observers, who consistently reported feeling a sense of awe, wonder, and connection to the past when
interacting with the restored structures. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced when the

architecture, and human experience.

Conclusion
The application of artificial intelligence in the restoration of medieval Gothic architecture has
the potential to revolutionize the field of historical preservation. By leveraging machine learning
algorithms and computer vision techniques, it is possible to recreate and restore damaged or destroyed
architectural elements with unprecedented accuracy. One potential approach to this problem involves
training a neural network on a dataset of intact Gothic structures, allowing it to learn the underlying
patterns and styles that define the genre. This trained network could then be used to generate
restoration proposals for damaged buildings, taking into account factors such as the original materials,
construction techniques, and aesthetic sensibilities of the medieval architects.
However, a more unorthodox approach might involve using AI to generate entirely new and fantastical
Gothic structures, which could then be used as inspiration for restoration projects. For example, a
neural network could be trained on a dataset of Gothic buildings, but with the addition of elements
from science fiction or fantasy, such as towering spires that defy gravity or grand halls filled with
a labyrinthine network of staircases. The resulting structures could be used as a starting point for
restoration projects, allowing architects and preservationists to push the boundaries of what is possible
while still remaining true to the spirit of the original buildings.
Ultimately, the key to successful AI-assisted restoration of medieval Gothic architecture will be to
strike a balance between preserving the historical integrity of the buildings and allowing for innovative
and creative solutions to the challenges posed by their restoration. By embracing the possibilities
offered by artificial intelligence, while also respecting the cultural and historical significance of these
structures, it may be possible to create restorations that are not only accurate and authentic, but also
vibrant and dynamic, reflecting the needs and sensibilities of contemporary society. Furthermore,
the use of AI in this context could also help to facilitate a greater understanding and appreciation of
medieval Gothic architecture, allowing people to experience and interact with these buildings in new
and innovative ways, and thereby ensuring their continued relevance and importance for generations
to come.
The integration of AI in the restoration process can also facilitate the involvement of a wider range of
stakeholders, including local communities, historians, and artists, who can contribute their knowledge
and expertise to the restoration effort. This collaborative approach can help to ensure that the restored
buildings are not only historically accurate but also culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs of the
local population. Additionally, the use of AI can help to streamline the restoration process, reducing
costs and increasing efficiency, while also allowing for the creation of detailed digital models and
simulations of the restored buildings, which can be used for educational and tourist purposes.
In the future, it is possible that AI-assisted restoration of medieval Gothic architecture could become
a major area of research and development, with significant investments of time, money, and resources.
As the technology continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that we will see the emergence of new
and innovative approaches to restoration, which will allow us to preserve and protect these incredible
buildings for generations to come. Moreover, the application of AI in this field could also have
significant implications for other areas of historical preservation, such as the restoration of ancient
ruins, historic landmarks, and cultural artifacts, allowing us to push the boundaries of what is possible

and to create new and innovative solutions to the challenges posed by the preservation of our cultural
heritage.

P128.pdf,"End-to-End Neural Discourse Deixis Resolution in
Dialogue
Abstract
We adapt a span-based entity coreference model to the task of end-to-end discourse
deixis resolution in dialogue, specifically by proposing extensions to their model
that exploit task-specific characteristics. The resulting model, dd-utt, achieves
state-of-the-art results on the four datasets.
1
Introduction
Discourse deixis (DD) resolution, also known as abstract anaphora resolution, is an under-investigated
task that involves resolving a deictic anaphor to its antecedent. A deixis is a reference to a discourse
entity such as a proposition, a description, an event, or a speech act. DD resolution is arguably
more challenging than the extensively-investigated entity coreference resolution task. Recall that in
entity coreference, the goal is to cluster the entity mentions in narrative text or dialogue, which are
composed of pronouns, names, and nominals, so that the mentions in each cluster refer to the same
real-world entity. Lexical overlap is a strong indicator of entity coreference, both among names (e.g.,
“President Biden”, “Joe Biden”) and in the resolution of nominals (e.g., linking “the president” to
“President Biden”). DD resolution, on the other hand, can be viewed as a generalized case of event
coreference involving the clustering of deictic anaphors, which can be pronouns or nominals, and
clauses, such that the mentions in each cluster refer to the same real-world proposition/event/speech
act, etc. An example of DD resolution in which the deictic anaphor “the move” refers to Salomon’s
act of issuing warrants on shares described in the preceding sentence. DD resolution is potentially
more challenging than entity coreference resolution because (1) DD resolution involves understanding
clause semantics, which are arguably harder to encode than noun phrase semantics; and (2) string
matching plays little role in DD resolution, unlike in entity coreference.
We focus on end-to-end DD resolution in dialogue. While the deictic anaphors in dialogue are also
composed of pronouns and nominals, the proportion of pronominal deictic anaphors in dialogue is
much higher than that in narrative text. For instance, the percentage of pronominal deictic anaphors
rises to 93
Since DD resolution can be cast as a generalized case of event coreference, a natural question is:
how successful would a state-of-the-art entity coreference model be when applied to DD resolution?
Recently, a re-implementation of a span-based entity coreference model has been applied to resolve
the deictic anaphors in the DD track after augmenting it with a type prediction model. Not only
did they achieve the highest score on each dataset, but they beat the second-best system, which is a
non-span-based neural approach combined with hand-crafted rules, by a large margin. These results
suggest that a span-based approach to DD resolution holds promise.
Our contributions are three-fold. First, we investigate whether task-specific observations can be
exploited to extend a span-based model originally developed for entity coreference to improve
its performance for end-to-end DD resolution in dialogue. Second, our extensions are effective
in improving model performance, allowing our model to achieve state-of-the-art results. Finally,
we present an empirical analysis of our model, which, to our knowledge, is the first analysis of a
state-of-the-art span-based DD resolver.

Related Work
Broadly, existing approaches to DD resolution can be divided into three categories, as described
below.
• Rule-based approaches. Early systems that resolve deictic expressions are rule-based.
Specifically, they use predefined rules to extract anaphoric mentions, and select antecedent
for each extracted anaphor based on the dialogue act types of each candidate antecedent.
• Non-neural learning-based approaches. Early non-neural learning-based approaches to
DD resolution use hand-crafted feature vectors to represent mentions. A classifier is then
trained to determine whether a pair of mentions is a valid antecedent-anaphor pair.
• Deep learning-based approaches. Deep learning has been applied to DD resolution. For
instance, a Siamese neural network is used, which takes as input the embeddings of two
sentences, one containing a deictic anaphor and the other a candidate antecedent, to score
each candidate antecedent and subsequently rank the candidate antecedents based on these
scores. In addition, motivated by the recent successes of Transformer-based approaches
to entity coreference, a Transformer-based approach to DD resolution has recently been
proposed, which is an end-to-end coreference system based on SpanBERT. Their model
jointly learns mention extraction and DD resolution and has achieved state-of-the-art results.
3
Corpora
We use the DD-annotated corpora provided as part of the shared task. For training, we use the
official training corpus from the shared task, ARRAU, which consists of three conversational sub-
corpora (TRAINS-93, TRAINS-91, PEAR) and two non-dialogue sub-corpora (GNOME, RST).
For validation and evaluation, we use the official development sets and test sets from the shared
task. The shared task corpus is composed of four well-known conversational datasets: AMI, LIGHT,
Persuasion, and Switchboard. Statistics on these corpora are provided in Table 1.
4
Baseline Systems
We employ three baseline systems.
The first baseline, coref-hoi, is a re-implementation of a widely-used end-to-end entity coreference
model. The model ranks all text spans of up to a predefined length based on how likely they
correspond to entity mentions. For each top-ranked span z, the model learns a distribution P(y) over
its antecedents y ∈Y(z), where Y(z) includes a dummy antecedent ϵ and every preceding span:
P(y) =
es(z,y)
P
y′∈Y(z) es(z,y′)
(1)
where s(x, y) is a pairwise score that incorporates two types of scores: (1) sm(·), which indicates
how likely a span is a mention, and (2) sc(·) and sa(·), which indicate how likely two spans refer to
2
the same entity (sc(z, ϵ) = sa(z, ϵ) = 0 for dummy antecedents):
s(z, y) = sm(x) + sm(y) + sc(z, y) + sa(z, y)
(2)
sm(·) = FFNNm(gz)
(3)
sc(z, y) = gT
x Wcgy
(4)
sa(z, y) = FFNNa([gx, gy, gx ⊙gy, ϕ(x, y)])
(5)
where gx and gy are the vector representations of x and y, Wc is a learned weight matrix for bilinear
scoring, FFNN(·) is a feedforward neural network, and ϕ(·) encodes features. Two features are used,
one encoding speaker information and the other the segment distance between two spans.
The second baseline, UTD_NLP, is the top-performing system in the DD track of the shared task.
It extends coref-hoi with a set of modifications. Two of the most important modifications are:
(1) the addition of a sentence distance feature to ϕ(·), and (2) the incorporation into coref-hoi
a type prediction model, which predicts the type of a span. The possible types of a span i are:
ANTECEDENT (if i corresponds to an antecedent), ANAPHOR (if i corresponds to an anaphor),
and NULL (if it is neither an antecedent nor an anaphor). The types predicted by the model are then
used by coref-hoi as follows: only spans predicted as ANAPHOR can be resolved, and they can only
be resolved to spans predicted as ANTECEDENT.
The third baseline, coref-hoi-utt, is essentially the first baseline except that we restrict the candidate
antecedents to be utterances. This restriction is motivated by the observation that the antecedents of
the deictic anaphors in the datasets are all utterances.
5
Model
Next, we describe our resolver, dd-utt, which augments coref-hoi-utt with 10 extensions.
E1. Modeling recency. Unlike in entity coreference, where two coreferent names (e.g., “Joe Biden”,
“President Biden”) can be far apart from each other in the corresponding document (because names
are non-anaphoric), the distance between a deictic anaphor and its antecedent is comparatively smaller.
To model recency, we restrict the set of candidate antecedents of an anaphor to be the utterance
containing the anaphor as well as the preceding 10 utterances, the choice of which is based on our
observation of the development data, where the 10 closest utterances already cover 96–99% of the
antecedent-anaphor pairs.
E2. Modeling distance. While the previous extension allows us to restrict our attention to candidate
antecedents that are close to the anaphor, it does not model the fact that the likelihood of being
the correct antecedent tends to increase as its distance from the anaphor decreases. To model this
relationship, we subtract the term γ1Dist(x, y) from s(x, y) (see Equation (1)), where Dist(x, y) is
the utterance distance between anaphor x and candidate antecedent y and γ1 is a tunable parameter
that controls the importance of utterance distance in the resolution process. Since s(x, y) is used to
rank candidate antecedents, modeling utterance distance by updating s(x, y) will allow distance to
have a direct impact on DD resolution.
E3. Modeling candidate antecedent length. Some utterances are pragmatic in nature and do not
convey any important information. Therefore, they cannot serve as antecedents of deictic anaphors.
Examples include “Umm”, “Ahhhh... okay”, “that’s right”, and “I agree”. Ideally, the model can
identify such utterances and prevent them from being selected as antecedents. We hypothesize that
we could help the model by modeling such utterances. To do so, we observe that such utterances
tend to be short and model them by penalizing shorter utterances. Specifically, we subtract the term
γ2
1
Length(y) from s(x, y), where Length(y) is the number of words in candidate antecedent y and γ2
is a tunable parameter that controls the importance of candidate antecedent length in resolution.
E4. Extracting candidate anaphors. As mentioned before, the deictic anaphors in dialogue are
largely composed of pronouns. Specifically, in our development sets, the three pronouns “that”,
“this”, and ‘it’ alone account for 74–88% of the anaphors. Consequently, we extract candidate deictic
anaphors as follows: instead of allowing each span of length n or less to be a candidate anaphor, we
only allow a span to be a candidate anaphor if its underlying word/phrase has appeared at least once
in the training set as a deictic anaphor.
3
E5. Predicting anaphors. Now that we have the candidate anaphors, our next extension involves
predicting which of them are indeed deictic anaphors. To do so, we retrain the type prediction model
in UTD_NLP, which is a FFNN that takes as input the (contextualized) span representation gi of
candidate anaphor i and outputs a vector oti of dimension 2 in which the first element denotes the
likelihood that i is a deictic anaphor and the second element denotes the likelihood that i is not a
deictic anaphor. i is predicted as a deictic anaphor if and only if the value of the first element of oti is
bigger than its second value:
oti = FFNN(gi)
(6)
ti = arg
max
x∈{A,NA} oti(x)
(7)
where A (ANAPHOR) and NA (NON-ANAPHOR) are the two possible types. Following UTD_NLP,
this type prediction model is jointly trained with the resolution model. Specifically, we compute the
cross-entropy loss using oti, multiply it by a type loss coefficient λ, and add it to the loss function of
coref-hoi-utt. λ is a tunable parameter that controls the importance of type prediction relative to DD
resolution.
E6. Modeling the relationship between anaphor recognition and resolution. In principle, the
model should resolve a candidate anaphor to a non-dummy candidate antecedent if it is predicted
to be a deictic anaphor by the type prediction model. However, type prediction is not perfect, and
enforcing this consistency constraint, which we will refer to as C1, will allow errors in type prediction
to be propagated to DD resolution. For example, if a non-deictic anaphor is misclassified by the type
prediction model, then it will be (incorrectly) resolved to a non-dummy antecedent. To alleviate
error propagation, we instead enforce C1 in a soft manner. To do so, we define a penalty function p1,
which imposes a penalty on span i if C1 is violated (i.e., a deictic anaphor is resolved to the dummy
antecedent), as shown below:
p1(i) =
0
if arg maxy∈Y s(i, y) = ϵ and ti = NA
oti(A) −oti(NA)
otherwise
(8)
Intuitively, p1 estimates the minimum amount to be adjusted so that span i’s type is not ANAPHOR.
We incorporate pi into the model as a penalty term in s (Equation (1)). Specifically, we redefine
s(i, ϵ) as shown below:
s(i, ϵ) = s(i, ϵ) −[γ3p1(i)]
(9)
where γ3 is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C1. The smaller γ3 is, the softer C1 is.
Intuitively, if C1 is violated, s(i, ϵ) will be lowered by the penalty term, and the dummy antecedent
will less likely be selected as the antecedent of i.
E7. Modeling the relationship between non-anaphor recognition and resolution. Another
consistency constraint that should be enforced is that the model should resolve a candidate anaphor
to the dummy antecedent if it is predicted as a non-deictic anaphor by the type prediction model. As
in Extension E6, we will enforce this constraint, which we will refer to as C2, in a soft manner by
defining a penalty function p2, as shown below:
p2(i) =
oti(NA) −oti(A)
if arg maxy∈Y s(i, y) ̸= ϵ and ti = NA
0
otherwise
(10)
Then we redefine s(i, j) when j ̸= ϵ as follows:
s(i, j) = s(i, j) −[γ4p2(i)]
(11)
where γ4 is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C2. Intuitively, if C2 is violated, s(i, j)
will be lowered by the penalty term, and j will less likely be selected as the antecedent of i.
E8. Encoding candidate anaphor context. Examining Equation (1), we see that s(x, y) is computed
based on the span representations of x and y. While these span representations are contextualized,
the contextual information they encode is arguably limited. As noted before, most of the deictic
anaphors in dialogue are pronouns, which are semantically empty. As a result, we hypothesize that
we could improve the resolution of these deictic anaphors if we explicitly modeled their contexts.
Specifically, we represent the context of a candidate anaphor using the embedding of the utterance in
which it appears and add the resulting embedding as features to both the bilinear score sc(x, y) and
the concatenation-based score sa(x, y):
sc(x, y) = gT
x Wcgy + gT
s Wagy
(12)
sa(x, y) = FFNNa([gx, gy, gx ⊙gy, gs, ϕ(x, y)])

where Wc and Wa are learned weight matrices, gs is the embedding of the utterance s in which
candidate anaphor x appears, and ϕ(x, y) encodes the relationship between x and y as features.
E9. Encoding the relationship between candidate anaphors and antecedents. As noted in
Extension E8, ϕ(x, y) encodes the relationship between candidate anaphor x and candidate antecedent
y. In UTD_NLP, ϕ(x, y) is composed of three features, including two features from coref-hoi-utt
(i.e., the speaker id and the segment distance between x and y) and one feature that encodes the
utterance distance between them. Similar to the previous extension, we hypothesize that we could
better encode the relationship between x and y using additional features. Specifically, we incorporate
an additional feature into ϕ(x, y) that encodes the utterance distance between x and y. Unlike the one
used in UTD_NLP, this feature aims to more accurately capture proximity by ignoring unimportant
sentences (i.e., those that contain only interjections, filling words, reporting verbs, and punctuation)
when computing utterance distance. The complete list of filling words and reporting verbs that we
filter can be found in Table 2.
E10. Encoding candidate antecedents. In coref-hoi-utt, a candidate antecedent is simply encoded
using its span representation. We hypothesize that we could better encode a candidate antecedent
using additional features. Specifically, we employ seven features to encode a candidate antecedent y
and incorporate them into ϕ(x, y): (1) the number of words in y; (2) the number of nouns in y; (3)
the number of verbs in y; (4) the number of adjectives in y; (5) the number of content word overlaps
between y and the portion of the utterance containing the anaphor that precedes the anaphor; (6)
whether y is the longest among the candidate antecedents; and (7) whether y has the largest number of
content word overlap (as computed in Feature #5) among the candidate antecedents. Like Extension
E3, some features implicitly encode the length of a candidate antecedent. Despite this redundancy,
we believe the redundant information could be exploited by the model differently and may therefore
have varying degrees of impact on it.

Evaluation
6.1
Experimental Setup
Evaluation metrics. We obtain the results of DD resolution using the Universal Anaphora Scorer.
Since DD resolution is viewed as a generalized case of event coreference, the scorer reports perfor-
mance in terms of CoNLL score, which is the unweighted average of the F-scores of three coreference
scoring metrics, namely MUC, B3, and CEAFe. In addition, we report the results of deictic anaphor
recognition. We express recognition results in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-score, con-

sidering an anaphor correctly recognized if it has an exact match with a gold anaphor in terms of
boundary.
Model training and parameter tuning. For coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt, we use SpanBERTLarge as
the encoder and reuse the hyperparameters with the only exception of the maximum span width: for
coref-hoi, we increase the maximum span width from 30 to 45 in order to cover more than 97% of
the antecedent spans; coref-hoi-utt we use 15 as the maximum span width, which covers more than
99% of the anaphor spans in the training sets. For UTD_NLP, we simply take the outputs produced
by the model on the test sets and report the results obtained by running the scorer on the outputs. For
dd-utt, we use SpanBERTLarge as the encoder. Since we do not rely on span enumerate to generate
candidate spans, the maximum span width can be set to any arbitrary number that is large enough
to cover all candidate antecedents and anaphors. In our case, we use 300 as our maximum span
width. We tune the parameters (i.e., λ, γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4) using grid search to maximize CoNLL score on
development data. For the type loss coefficient, we search out of {0.2, 0.5, 1, 200, 500, 800, 1200,
1600}, and for γ, we search out of {1, 5, 10}.
All models are trained for 30 epochs with a dropout rate of 0.3 and early stopping. We use 1 × 10−5
as our BERT learning rate and 3 × 10−4 as our task learning rate. Each experiment is run using a
random seed of 11 and takes less than three hours to train on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB.
Train-dev partition. Since we have four test sets, we use ARRAU and all dev sets other than
the one to be evaluated on for model training and the remaining dev set for parameter tuning. For
example, when evaluating on AMItest, we train models on ARRAU, LIGHTdev, Persuasiondev and
Switchboarddev and use AMIdev for tuning.
6.2
Results
Recall that our goal is to perform end-to-end DD resolution, which corresponds to the Predicted
evaluation setting in the shared task.
Overall performance. Recognition results (expressed in F-score) and resolution results (expressed
in CoNLL score) of the three baselines and our model on the four test sets are shown in Table 3,
where the Avg. columns report the macro-averages of the corresponding results on the four test
sets, and the parameter settings that enable our model to achieve the highest CoNLL scores on the
development sets are shown in Table 4. Since coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt do not explicitly identify
deictic anaphors, we assume that all but the first mentions in each output cluster are anaphors when
computing recognition precision; and while UTD_NLP (the top-performing system in the shared
task) does recognize anaphors, we still make the same assumption when computing its recognition
precision since the anaphors are not explicitly marked in the output (recall that we computed results
of UTD_NLP based on its outputs).
6
We test the statistical significance among the four models using two-tailed Approximate Random-
ization. For recognition, the models are statistically indistinguishable from each other w.r.t. their
Avg. score (p < 0.05). For resolution, dd-utt is highly significantly better than the baselines w.r.t.
Avg. (p < 0.001), while the three baselines are statistically indistinguishable from each other. These
results suggest that (1) dd-utt’s superior resolution performance stems from better antecedent selec-
tion, not better anaphor recognition; and (2) the restriction of candidate antecedents to utterances in
coref-hoi-utt does not enable the resolver to yield significantly better resolution results than coref-hoi.
Per-anaphor results. Next, we show the recognition and resolution results of the four models on the
most frequently occurring deictic anaphors in Table 5 after micro-averaging them over the four test
sets. Not surprisingly, “that” is the most frequent deictic anaphor on the test sets, appearing as an
anaphor 402 times on the test sets and contributing to 68.8% of the anaphors. This is followed by “it”
(16.3%) and “this” (4.3%). Only 8.9% of the anaphors are not among the top four anaphors.
Consider first the recognition results. As can be seen, “that” has the highest recognition F-score
among the top anaphors. This is perhaps not surprising given the comparatively larger number of
“that” examples the models are trained on. While “it” occurs more frequently than “this” as a deictic
anaphor, its recognition performance is lower than that of “this”. This is not surprising either: “this”,
when used as a pronoun, is more likely to be deictic than “it”, although both of them can serve as
a coreference anaphor and a bridging anaphor. In other words, it is comparatively more difficult to
determine whether a particular occurrence of “it” is deictic. Overall, UTD_NLP recognizes more
anaphors than the other models.
Next, consider the resolution results. To obtain the CoNLL scores for a given anaphor, we retain all
and only those clusters containing the anaphor in both the gold partition and the system partition and
apply the official scorer to them. Generally, the more frequently occurring an anaphor is, the better
its resolution performance is. Interestingly, for the “Others” category, dd-utt achieves the highest
resolution results despite having the lowest recognition performance. In contrast, while UTD_NLP
achieves the best recognition performance on average, its resolution results are among the worst.
Results of the four resolvers (UTD_NLP, coref-hoi, coref-hoi-utt, and dd-utt) on the CODI-CRAC
2021 shared task test sets in terms of MUC, B3, and CEAFe scores are reported in Table. Their
mention extraction results in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F) are provided in Table.
dd-utt achieves the best CoNLL scores on all four datasets, via achieving the best MUC, B3, and
CEAFe F-scores. In terms of MUC F-score, the performance difference between dd-utt and the
second best resolver on each dataset is substantial (2.2%-14.9% points). These results suggest that
better link identification, which is what the MUC F- score reveals, is the primary reason for the
superior performance of dd-utt. Moreover, Persuasion appears to be the easiest of the four datasets,
as this is the dataset on which three of the four resolvers achieved the highest CoNLL scores. Note
that Persuasion is also the dataset on which the differences in CoNLL score between dd-utt and the
other resolvers are the smallest. These results seem to suggest that the performance gap between
dd-utt and the other resolvers tends to widen as the difficulty of a dataset increases.
In terms of anaphor extraction results in Table, dd-utt lags behind UTD_NLP on two datasets, AMI
and Switchboard, in terms of F-score. Nevertheless, the anaphor extraction precision achieved by
dd-utt is often one of the highest in each dataset.
7
Further Analysis
An example is analyzed. In this example, dd-utt successfully extracts the anaphor ""that"" and resolves
it to the correct antecedent, ""Losing one decimal place, that is okay"". UTD_NLP fails to extract ""that""
as a deictic anaphor. While coref-hoi correctly extracts the anaphor, it incorrectly selects ""You want
your rating to be a two?"" as the antecedent. From a cursory look at this example, one could infer that
this candidate antecedent is highly unlikely to be the correct antecedent since it is 10 utterances away
from the anaphor. As for coref-hoi-utt, the resolver successfully extracts the anaphor but incorrectly
selects ""Its just two point five for that one"" as the antecedent, which, like the antecedent chosen by
coref-hoi, is farther away from the anaphor than the correct antecedent. Coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt
fail to identify the correct antecedent because they do not explicitly model distance and therefore may
not have an idea about how far a candidate antecedent is from the anaphor under consideration. The

Error Analysis
DD anaphora recognition precision errors. A common type of recognition precision errors involves
misclassifying a coreference anaphor as a deictic anaphor. Consider the first example in Figure 2, in
which the pronoun ""that"" is a coreference anaphor with ""voice recognition"" as its antecedent but is
misclassified as a deictic anaphor with the whole sentence as its antecedent. This type of error occurs
because virtually all of the frequently occurring deictic anaphors, including ""that"", ""it"", ""this"", and
""which"", appear as a coreference anaphor in some contexts and as a deictic anaphor in other contexts,
and distinguishing between the two different uses of these anaphors could be challenging.
DD anaphor recognition recall errors. Consider the second example in Figure 2, in which ""it"" is a
deictic anaphor that refers to the boldfaced utterance, but dd-utt fails to identify this and many other
occurrences of ""it"" as deictic, probably because ""it"" is more likely to be a coreference anaphor than a
deictic anaphor: in the dev sets, 80% of the occurrences of ""it"" are coreference anaphors while only
5% are deictic anaphors.
DD resolution precision errors. A major source of DD resolution precision errors can be attributed

to the model’s failure in properly understanding the context in which a deictic anaphor appears.
Consider the third example in Figure 2, in which ""that"" is a deictic anaphor that refers to the boldfaced
utterance. While dd-utt correctly identifies ""that"" as a deictic anaphor, it erroneously posits the
italicized utterance as its antecedent. This example is interesting in that without looking at the
boldfaced utterance, the italicized utterance is a plausible antecedent for ""that"" because ""I am not
surprised to hear that at all"" can be used as a response to almost every statement. However, when
both the boldfaced utterance and the italicized utterance are taken into consideration, it is clear that
the boldfaced utterance is the correct antecedent for ""that"" because winning over seven awards for
some charitable work is certainly more surprising than seeing a place bring awareness to the needs of
the young. Correctly resolving this anaphor, however, requires modeling the emotional implication of
its context.
A: The design should minimize R_S_I and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as
to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favored strategy, but there
was also, on the sideline, the thought of maybe having a beeper function.

P065.pdf,"Assessing the Stability of Stable Diffusion in a Recursive Inpainting
Scenario
Abstract
Generative Artificial Intelligence models for image generation have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks
like text-to-image synthesis and image completion through inpainting. Inpainting performance can be measured
by removing parts of an image, using the model to restore them, and comparing the result with the original. This
process can be applied recursively, where the output of one inpainting operation becomes the input for the next.
This recursive application can result in images that are either similar to or vastly different from the original,
depending on the removed sections and the model’s ability to reconstruct them. The ability to recover an image
similar to the original, even after numerous recursive inpainting operations, is a desirable characteristic referred to
as stability. This concept is also being explored in the context of recursively training generative AI models with
their own generated data. Recursive inpainting is a unique process that involves recursion only during inference,
and understanding its behavior can provide valuable insights that complement ongoing research on the effects of
recursion during training. This study investigates the effects of recursive inpainting on Stable Diffusion, a widely
used image model. The findings indicate that recursive inpainting can result in image degradation, ultimately
leading to a meaningless image, and that the final outcome is influenced by factors such as the image type, the size
of the inpainting areas, and the number of iterations.

Introduction
In the past two years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a central player, sparking a significant revolution in
technology. These AI models are capable of producing text, audio, images, and video, finding applications in a wide array of
transformative uses. Notable examples include Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT4, which excel at answering questions,
summarizing, translating, and paraphrasing texts, and text-to-image generators like DALL-E, which can generate images based on
almost any textual description. These tools have garnered widespread public interest, attracting hundreds of millions of users.
These AI tools have reached exceptional performance levels in various tasks, making their evaluation a crucial aspect. For LLMs,
numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate their knowledge across different subjects, their proficiency in solving
mathematical or reasoning problems, and their language comprehension. These benchmarks facilitate model comparisons, and when
a new model is launched, its performance on these standard benchmarks is typically reported. In the realm of image generation,
several metrics have been introduced to assess performance, including the Fr˘00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), precision and recall,
and density and coverage. These metrics aim to quantify how closely generated images resemble real ones and how effectively
they cover the spectrum of real images. Another capability offered by some AI image generation tools, and implemented through
specialized AI models, is inpainting. In this process, the AI tool is provided with an image containing missing parts and is tasked
with filling them in to complete the image.
Assessing the quality of content produced by AI is crucial not only for comparing different AI models or evaluating their progress
in specific tasks but also because the extensive use of generative AI is altering the fundamental nature of content found on the
Internet. AI-generated texts and images are now widespread and, in some instances, predominant, with this trend expected to
persist in the coming years. This has consequences for newer AI models, as they are frequently trained on data gathered from the
Internet, establishing a feedback loop where new models are trained using data created by earlier AI models. This cycle can result in
diminished performance or even the breakdown of AI models, prompting research into the stability of AI models when trained using
their own generated data.
The feedback loops in generative AI that have been examined thus far pertain to the training of newer models, creating a loop across
different generations of AI models. However, other potential loops in generative AI exist that have not been previously investigated
to the best of our knowledge. For instance, when the input to the AI model is an image and the output is also an image, as is the case
with inpainting, the AI model can be recursively applied to its own output, forming a loop. In this scenario, there is no training
involved, only inferences that are recursively applied. Examining the effects of these recursive applications of the AI model on the
generated content is essential to determine whether the AI models remain stable or degrade, similar to what occurs in the training
loop.
In this research, we examine the inference feedback loop utilizing a renowned AI image model, Stable Diffusion, and its inpainting
feature. A thorough empirical investigation is carried out to discern the conditions under which the model maintains stability and
when it experiences degradation. The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides a concise
overview of the inpainting feature and the feedback loops in generative AI. Section 3 introduces the inference loop, termed Recursive
Inpainting (RIP), which is then assessed in Section 4. The constraints of our assessment, along with the findings, are deliberated in
Section 5. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 6.

Preliminaries
2.1
Inpainting
Inpainting is a function found in some contemporary generative AI image tools, which involves filling in missing portions of an
image to complete it. The effectiveness of inpainting is contingent on the specific model used, the nature of the image, and the size
and placement of the missing areas. Generally, inpainting can only restore a portion of the information that is lost in the missing
image segments. Various metrics are available to assess the resemblance between the original image and the one reconstructed
through inpainting. These range from traditional methods like Structural Similarity (SSIM) and multi-scale SSIM (MS-SSIM), which
are based on pixel-level comparisons, to more sophisticated methods like Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and
Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P/U-IDS), which employ AI models to simulate human-like perceptual evaluations.
2.2
Recursiveness in Generative AI
A cycle is formed where AI-generated content is posted online and subsequently collected to train newer AI models. This can result
in a decline in the effectiveness of AI models, or even their failure, when they are trained using data they have produced themselves.
This has sparked a growing interest in determining the circumstances under which these generative AI models maintain stability
when trained recursively with data they generate. The stability is influenced by multiple factors, such as the specific model, the
quantity of AI-generated data used in each retraining cycle, and whether the cycle involves one or multiple AI models. Investigating
this cycle is crucial as it can affect not only the development of future AI models but also the type of content that will likely dominate
the Internet in the future. In all these investigations, the recursive aspect involves training new AI models with data produced by
other AI models. However, in certain situations, recursion can happen when the same AI model is used solely for making inferences.
This particular scenario has not been explored in previous studies, to the best of our knowledge.
3
Recursive Inpainting (RIP)
An intriguing aspect to note is that a distinct recursive loop can be established with AI image models when employing the inpainting
technique. This process begins with an image, to which a mask is applied to obscure certain areas, and inpainting is utilized to fill in
these areas. This results in a second image that has been partially generated by the AI image model. The procedure is then reiterated
using a different mask to produce a subsequent image, this time entirely generated from AI-produced content. The process continues
as inpainting is recursively applied to images that have already undergone inpainting. As parts of the images are removed and
reconstructed, information is inevitably lost. However, it is crucial to determine whether this loss leads to images that are drastically
different from the original, or if the images become simpler and less intricate. Alternatively, it is possible that the inpainting process
remains stable, resulting in images that are merely variations of the original. Similar to the recursive training of models with their
own data, it is important to understand the conditions under which inpainting remains stable or degrades under recursion.
The consequences of recursive inpainting are influenced by numerous factors, including the specific AI model employed, the
characteristics of the image, and the masks utilized in each iteration. It is reasonable to expect that more intricate images or masks
that obscure larger portions of the image will have a higher likelihood of causing degradation. In the subsequent section, we outline
the results of an extensive empirical investigation into recursive inpainting using Stable Diffusion, representing an initial effort to
identify the primary factors that influence the effects of recursive inpainting.
4
Evaluation
The primary factors influencing recursive inpainting are:
1. The AI model used. 2. The input images. 3. The masks applied at each stage. 4. The number of iterations.
In our experimental setup, we utilized Stable Diffusion, which is a text-to-image latent diffusion model, due to its open-source nature
and widespread use in the AI image model community. Specifically, we employed a version of Stable Diffusion 2 that was fine-tuned
for inpainting. This model uses a technique for generating masks where the masked areas, along with the latent VAE representations
of the masked image, provide additional conditioning for the inpainting process. The model’s parameters were kept at their default
settings. We did not use any text prompts to direct the inpainting, allowing the model to concentrate on reconstructing the missing
parts based solely on the remaining visual information without any textual guidance.
2
For the image selection, to minimize any potential bias, we randomly chose images from an extensive dataset containing over 81,000
art images of various types created by different artists. From this dataset, 100 images were randomly picked to form our evaluation
set. The input images are 512x512 pixels; if their original aspect ratio is not square, blank areas are added to the sides to achieve the
512x512 format.
In generating masks for inpainting, we divide the images into squares of a predetermined size. In each iteration, a square is randomly
chosen to serve as the mask. To facilitate comparisons across different mask and image sizes, our experiments use the number of
pixels inpainted relative to the image size as the primary parameter, rather than the number of inpainting operations.
To assess the similarity to the original image across iterations, we employ the Learned Perceptual Image Path Similarity (LPIPS)
metric, which is frequently used to evaluate inpainting quality. In our implementation, we utilize the features from three neural
networks to calculate the metric: SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG.
We conducted recursive inpainting, altering 400% of the pixels, using masks of sizes 64x64, 128x128, and 256x256. To measure the
degradation as inpainting operations are performed, we calculated the LPIPS metric between the original image and each subsequent
generation using the features from the three neural networks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG). The average distances for the 100
images at each 50% inpainting step are presented. The bars represent the standard deviation observed across the samples for each
data point. Several initial observations can be drawn from these results:
1. As the recursive inpainting progresses, the distance from the original image increases, potentially leading to an image that bears
no resemblance to the original. 2. The rate at which the distance increases tends to decrease, but it does not appear to stabilize even
when the distance becomes substantial. 3. The discrepancy with the original image is more pronounced when larger masks are used
for inpainting, which aligns with the expectation that larger blocks are more challenging to inpaint. 4. The three networks used for
computing the LPIPS (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG) yield comparable results. 5. The significant standard deviation indicates
that different images will exhibit varying behaviors.
To gain a better understanding of the variability in distances for each image, scatter plots of the LPIPS distances for the 100 images
for each neural network are presented. It is evident that there is considerable variability across images, but the general trends are
consistent with those observed in the mean: the distance increases with more inpainting and with larger masks. Among the three
networks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG), VGG shows the fewest outliers. Given that VGG is the most complex network, it
is expected to capture the image features more effectively. Consequently, we will only report results for VGG moving forward,
although all metrics are available in the repository along with the images.
To investigate whether the degradation is consistent across different runs, we selected 10 images from the set of 100 and performed
10 runs on each. The LPIPS metrics across these runs for three different images are displayed, using the VGG network, which
generally exhibits the lowest deviations. It is noticeable that variations are more significant with larger masks, which is anticipated
since larger masks require fewer iterations to reach a given percentage of inpainting, thus introducing more variability. The variations
also decrease as the percentage of inpainting increases, indicating that a higher number of inpainting operations leads to reduced
variability. This suggests that recursive inpainting tends to converge in terms of LPIPS distance as the process advances.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this study, we have introduced and empirically examined the impact of recursive inpainting on AI image models. The findings
reveal that recursion can result in the deterioration and eventual breakdown of the image, a phenomenon akin to the model collapse
observed when training generative AI models with their own data. This issue is currently a focal point in the research community.
Consequently, this paper introduces a new dimension to the study of the effects of recursive application of generative AI, specifically
in the inference phase. This can enhance current research endeavors and offer deeper insights into the underlying causes of collapse,
potentially leading to advancements in AI models that can lessen the adverse effects of recursion.
The presented analysis of recursive inpainting represents an initial step in this area. Further investigation involving different AI
models, a variety of images, and diverse model configurations is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects
of recursive inpainting. Developing theoretical models that can account for these effects is also a crucial area for future research.
Additionally, exploring the connections between recursive training and recursive inpainting could provide valuable insights.

P089.pdf,"Precise Requirements for the Validity of the Neural Tangent Kernel
Approximation
Abstract
This research investigates the conditions under which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approximation remains
valid when employing the square loss function for model training. Within the framework of lazy training, as
introduced by Chizat et al., we demonstrate that a model, rescaled by a factor of α = O(T), maintains the validity
of the NTK approximation up to a training time of T. This finding refines the earlier result from Chizat et al.,
which necessitated a larger rescaling factor of α = O(T 2), and establishes the preciseness of our established
bound.

Introduction
In contemporary machine learning practice, the weights w of expansive neural network models fw : Rdin →Rdout are trained
using gradient-based optimizers. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive due to the non-linear nature
of the training dynamics, which complicates analysis. To bridge this gap, an approximation to these dynamics, termed the NTK
approximation, was introduced, and its validity for infinitely wide networks trained via gradient descent was demonstrated. The NTK
approximation has proven highly influential, offering theoretical insights into various phenomena, including deep learning’s capacity
to memorize training data, the manifestation of spectral bias in neural networks, and the differential generalization capabilities of
diverse architectures. Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggests that the training dynamics of neural networks frequently deviate
from the NTK approximation’s predictions. Consequently, it becomes crucial to delineate the precise conditions under which the
NTK approximation remains applicable. This paper seeks to address the following inquiry:
Is it possible to establish precise conditions that guarantee the validity of the NTK approximation?
1.1
The Lazy Training Framework
The work demonstrated that the NTK approximation is applicable to the training of any differentiable model, provided the model’s
outputs are rescaled appropriately. This rescaling ensures that significant changes in the model’s outputs can occur even with minor
adjustments to the weights. The validity of the NTK approximation for models of infinite width stems from this observation, as the
model is inherently rescaled as its width approaches infinity.
Consider a smoothly parameterized model h : Rp →F, where F is a separable Hilbert space. Let α > 0 be a parameter governing
the model’s rescaling, which should be considered large. We train the rescaled model αh using gradient flow to minimize a smooth
loss function R : F →R+. The weights w(t) ∈Rp are initialized at w(0) = w0 and evolve according to the gradient flow:
dw
dt = −1
α2 ∇wR(αh(w(t))).
(1)
Define the linear approximation of the model around the initial weights w0 as:
¯h(w) = h(w0) + Dh(w0)(w −w0),
(2)
where Dh is the first derivative of h with respect to w. Let ¯w(t) be weights initialized at ¯w(0) = w0 that evolve according to the
gradient flow from training the rescaled linearized model α¯h:
d ¯w
dt = −1
α2 ∇¯
wR(α¯h( ¯w(t))).
(3)
The NTK approximation asserts that:
αh(w(t)) ≈α¯h( ¯w(t)).
(4)
In essence, this implies that the linearization of the model h remains valid throughout the training process. This greatly simplifies
the analysis of training dynamics, as the model ¯h is linear in its parameters, allowing the evolution of ¯h( ¯w) to be understood through
a kernel gradient flow in function space.
The validity of the NTK approximation is contingent on the magnitude of the rescaling parameter α. Intuitively, a larger α
implies that the weights need not deviate significantly from their initialization to induce substantial changes in the model’s output,
thereby prolonging the validity of the linearization. This regime of training, where weights remain close to their initialization,
is referred to as ""lazy training."" The following bound was established, where R0 = R(αh(w0))) is the loss at initialization, and
κ = Tα−1Lip(Dh)√R0 is a quantity that will also feature in our main results:
**Proposition 1.1.** Let R(y) = 1
2∥y −y∗∥2
2 be the square loss, where y∗∈F are the target labels. Assume that h is Lip(h)-
Lipschitz and that Dh is Lip(Dh)-Lipschitz in a ball of radius ρ around w0. Then, for any time 0 ≤T ≤αρ/(Lip(h)√R0),
∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤TLip(h)2κR0.
(5)
As α approaches infinity, κ tends to 0, rendering the right-hand side of the inequality small and validating the NTK approximation.
1.2
Our Contributions
Our primary contribution is the refinement of the bound for extended time scales. We establish the following theorem:
**Theorem 1.2 (NTK Approximation Error Bound).** Let R(y) = 1
2∥y −y∗∥2
2 be the square loss. Assume that Dh is Lip(Dh)-
Lipschitz in a ball of radius ρ around w0. Then, at any time 0 ≤T ≤α2ρ2/R0,
∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤min(6κ
p
R0, 8R0).
(6)
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this bound is tight up to a constant factor.
**Theorem 1.3 (Converse to Theorem 1.2).** For any α, T, Lip(Dh), and R0, there exists a model h : R →R, a target y∗∈R, and
an initialization w0 ∈R such that, for the risk R(y) = 1
2(y −y∗)2, the initial risk is R(αh(w0)) = R0, the derivative map Dh is
Lip(Dh)-Lipschitz, and
∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≥min
1
5κ

.
(7)
In contrast to prior work, our bound does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of h, and it exhibits a more favorable dependence on
T. Specifically, if Lip(Dh), Lip(h), and R0 are bounded by constants, our result indicates that the NTK approximation, up to an
error of O(ϵ), holds for times T = O(αϵ), whereas the previously known bound was valid for T = O(√αϵ). Given the practical
interest in long training times T ≫1, our result demonstrates that the NTK approximation is valid for significantly longer time
horizons than previously recognized.
2
Application to Neural Networks
The bound established in Theorem 1.2 is applicable to the lazy training of any differentiable model. As a specific example, we detail
its application to neural networks. We parameterize the networks in the mean-field regime, where the NTK approximation does not
hold even as the width approaches infinity. Consequently, the NTK approximation is valid only when training is conducted in the
lazy regime.
Let fw : Rd →R be a 2-layer network of width m in the mean-field parametrization, with activation function σ : R →R,
fw(x) =
1
√m
m
X
i=1
aiσ(√m⟨x, ui⟩).
(8)
The weights are w
=
(a, U) for a
=
[a1, . . . , am] and U
=
[u1, . . . , um].
These are initialized at w0 with i.i.d.
Unif[−1/√m, 1/√m] entries. Given training data (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn), we train the weights of the network with the mean-
squared loss
L(w) = 1
n

i=1
ℓ(fw(xi), yi),
ℓ(a, b) = 1
2(a −b)2.

In the Hilbert space notation, we let H = Rn, so that the gradient flow training dynamics with loss (6) correspond to the gradient
flow dynamics (1) with the following model and loss function
h(w) =
1
√n[fw(x1), . . . , fw(xn)] ∈Rn,
R(v) = 1

(10)
Under certain regularity assumptions on the activation function (satisfied, for instance, by the sigmoid function) and a bound on the
weights, it can be shown that Lip(Dh) is bounded.
**Lemma 2.1 (Bound on Lip(Dh) for mean-field 2-layer network).** Suppose there exists a constant K such that (i) the activation
function σ is bounded and has bounded derivatives ∥σ∥∞, ∥σ′∥∞, ∥σ′′∥∞, ∥σ′′′∥∞≤K, (ii) the weights have bounded norm
∥U∥a ≤K, and (iii) the data points have bounded norm ∥x∥≤K. Then there exists a constant K′ depending only on K such that
Lip(Dh) ≤K′.
(11)
2
Since the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 are met, we obtain the following corollary for the lazy training dynamics of the 2-layer
mean-field network.
**Corollary 2.2 (Lazy training of 2-layer mean-field network).** Suppose the conditions of Lemma 2.1 hold, and also that the labels
are bounded in norm ∥y∥≤c. Then there exist constants C, c > 0 depending only on K such that for any time 0 ≤T ≤cα2,
∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤C min(T/α, 1).
(12)
Training in the NTK parametrization corresponds to training the model √mfw, where fw is the network in the mean-field
parametrization. This is equivalent to setting the lazy training parameter α = √m in the mean-field setting. Therefore, under the
NTK parametrization with width m, the bound in Corollary 2.2 indicates that the NTK approximation is valid until training time
O(m) and the error bound is O(T/√m).

Proof Ideas
3.1
Proof Ideas for Theorem 1.2
To provide intuition for our proof, we first outline the approach used in the original proof. Define residuals r(t), ¯r(t) ∈F
under training the original rescaled model αh(w(t)) and the linearized rescaled model α¯h( ¯w(t)) as r(t) = y∗−αh(w(t)) and
¯r(t) = y∗−α¯h( ¯w(t)). These evolve according to
dr
dt = −Ktr
and
d¯r
dt = −K0¯r,
(13)
where Kt := Dh(w(t))Dh(w(t))∗is the time-dependent kernel. To compare these trajectories, it was observed that, since K0 is
positive semidefinite,
d
dt∥r −¯r∥2
2 = −⟨r −¯r, Ktr −K0¯r⟩≤−⟨r −¯r, (Kt −K0)r⟩
(14)
which, dividing both sides by ∥r −¯r∥and using ∥r∥≤√R0, implies
d
dt∥r −¯r∥≤∥Kt −K0∥∥r∥≤2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)∥w −w0∥
p
R0.
(15)
Using the Lipschitzness of the model, it was further shown that the weight change is bounded by ∥w(t) −w0∥≤t√R0Lip(h)/α.
Plugging this into (7) yields the bound in Proposition 1.1,
∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥= ∥r(T) −¯r(T)∥≤2Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0α−1
Z T
0
tdt = T 2Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0/α.
(16)
**First attempt: strengthening of the bound for long time horizons** We demonstrate how to strengthen this bound to hold for longer
time horizons by employing an improved bound on the movement of the weights. Consider the following bound on the weight
change.
**Proposition 3.1 (Bound on weight change, implicit in proof of Theorem 2.2).**
∥w(T) −w0∥≤
p
TR0/α
and
∥¯w(T) −w0∥≤
p
TR0/α.
(17)
**Proof of Proposition 3.1.** By (a) Cauchy-Schwarz, and (b) the nonnegativity of the loss R,
∥w(T) −w(0)∥≤

(18)
The bound for ¯w is analogous.
This bound (8) has the advantage of
√
t dependence (instead of linear t dependence) and does not depend on Lip(h). Plugging it
into (7), we obtain
∥αh(w(T)) −α¯h( ¯w(T))∥≤2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)R0α−1
Z T
0
√
tdt = 4
3T 3/2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)R0/α.
(19)
This improves over Proposition 1.1 for long time horizons, as the time dependence scales as T 3/2 instead of T 2. However, it still
depends on the Lipschitz constant Lip(h) and falls short of the linear in T dependence of Theorem 1.2.
**Second attempt: new approach to prove Theorem 1.2** To avoid dependence on Lip(h) and achieve a linear dependence in T,
we develop a new approach. We cannot use (7), which was central to the original proof, as it depends on Lip(h). Furthermore, to
achieve linear T dependence using (7), we would need ∥w −w0∥= O(1) for a constant independent of the time horizon, which is
not true unless the problem is well-conditioned.
3
In the full proof in Appendix A, we bound ∥r(T) −¯r(T)∥, which requires working with a product integral formulation of the
dynamics of r to handle the time-varying kernels Kt. The main technical innovation in the proof is Theorem A.8, which is a new,
general bound on the difference between product integrals.
To avoid the technical complications of the appendix, we provide some intuitions here by proving a simplified theorem that does not
imply the main result. We show:
**Theorem 3.2 (Simplified variant of Theorem 1.2).** Consider r′(t) ∈F initialized as r′(0) = r(0) and evolving as dr′
dt = −KT r′.
Then,
∥r′(T) −¯r(T)∥≤min(3κ
p
R0, 8R0).
(20)
Intuitively, if we can prove in Theorem 3.2 that r′(T) and ¯r(T) are close, then the same should hold for r(T) and ¯r(T) as in
Theorem 1.2. For convenience, define the operators
A = Dh(w0)∗
and
B = Dh(w(T))∗−Dh(w0)∗.
(21)
Since the kernels do not vary in time, the closed-form solution is
r′(t) = e−(A+B)∗(A+B)tr(0)
and
¯r(t) = e−A∗Atr(0)
(22)
We prove that the time evolution operators for r′ and ¯r are close in operator norm.
**Lemma 3.3.** For any t ≥0, we have ∥e−(A+B)∗(A+B)t −e−A∗At∥≤2
√
t∥B∥.
**Proof of Lemma 3.3.** Define Z(ζ) = (A + ζB)∗(A + ζB)t. By the fundamental theorem of calculus,
∥e−(A+B)∗(A+B)t −e−A∗At∥= ∥eZ(1) −eZ(0)∥=

(25)
Finally, let us combine Lemma 3.3 with the weight-change bound in Proposition 3.1 to prove Theorem 3.2. Notice that the
weight-change bound in Proposition 3.1 implies
∥B∥≤Lip(Dh)∥w(T) −w0∥≤Lip(Dh)
p
TR0/α.
(26)
So Lemma 3.3 implies
∥r′(T) −¯r(T)∥≤2Lip(Dh)T
p
R0α−1∥r(0)∥= 2κ∥r(0)∥.
(27)
Combining this with ∥r′(T) −¯r(T)∥≤∥r′(T)∥+ ∥¯r(T)∥≤2√2R0 implies (9). Thus, we have shown Theorem 3.2, which is the
result of Theorem 1.2 if we replace r by r′. The actual proof of the theorem handles the time-varying kernel Kt and is in Appendix
A.
3.2
Proof Ideas for Theorem 1.3
The converse in Theorem 1.3 is achieved in the simple case where h(w) = aw + 1

w0 = 0 and R(y) = 1

Discussion
A limitation of our result is that it applies only to gradient flow, which corresponds to SGD with infinitesimally small step size.
However, larger step sizes are beneficial for generalization in practice, so it would be interesting to understand the validity of the
NTK approximation in that setting. Another limitation is that our result applies only to the square loss and not to other popular
losses such as the cross-entropy loss. Indeed, the known bounds in the setting of general losses require either a ""well-conditioning""
assumption or taking α exponential in the training time T. Can one prove bounds analogous to Theorem 1.2 for more general losses,
with α depending polynomially on T, and without conditioning assumptions?
A natural question raised by our bounds in Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 is: how do the dynamics behave just outside the regime where the
NTK approximation is valid? For models h where Lip(h) and Lip(Dh) are bounded by a constant, can we understand the dynamics
in the regime where T ≈Cα for some large constant C and α ≫C, at the edge of the lazy training regime?

Nevertheless, with the advancements in deep learning, more effective feature extraction instruments have become
accessible. This research introduces the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN), a customized neural network
architecture designed to autonomously generate a variety of financial technical indicators using established
knowledge. Our primary contributions are threefold. Firstly, we employ domain-specific expertise in quantitative
trading to formulate sampling guidelines and the objective function. Secondly, we substitute genetic programming
with pre-training and model pruning techniques to enable a more streamlined evolutionary process. Thirdly, the
feature extraction components within ADNN can be interchanged with various other feature extractors, resulting
in the creation of diverse functions. Empirical findings demonstrate that ADNN can produce more distinct and
informative features in comparison to GP, thereby effectively augmenting the existing pool of factors. Fully
connected and recurrent networks demonstrate superior performance in extracting information from financial
time series compared to convolutional neural networks. In practical scenarios, the features generated by ADNN
consistently enhance the revenue, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown of multi-factor strategies when contrasted
with investment strategies that do not incorporate these factors.

Introduction
Predicting the future returns of stocks is a paramount and demanding endeavor in the field of quantitative trading. Numerous
factors, including historical price, volume, and a company’s financial information, can be employed to forecast the future returns of
stocks. Typically, researchers categorize features derived from price and volume as technical indicators, while those derived from
a company’s financial data are classified as fundamental data. Various well-known multi-factor models have been introduced to
address this task, and numerous established technical and fundamental factors have been developed. For instance, the Fama-French
Three-Factor Model utilizes three crucial factors that furnish the majority of the information required to elucidate stock returns.
Subsequently, the Fama-French Five-Factor Model and numerous other factors have been formulated by domain experts. Nonetheless,
two limitations exist. Firstly, recruiting human specialists is quite costly. Secondly, humans are unable to create certain nonlinear
features from data with high dimensionality. Consequently, both academic scholars and institutional investors have increasingly
focused on the task of automated financial feature engineering.
Feature engineering is a procedure that uncovers the connections between features and expands the feature space by deducing or
generating novel features. During this operation, new features can be created by combining pre-existing features. A more explicit
explanation is that algorithms employ operators, hyper-parameters, and existing features to construct a new feature. Occasionally,
feature construction and feature selection can be integrated into a single process. These methodologies encompass wrapper, filtering,
and embedded techniques. Filtering is straightforward but yields suboptimal results; it merely employs certain criteria to select a
feature and can sometimes aid in overseeing the feature construction process. The wrapper method exhibits strong performance
by directly utilizing the model’s outcomes as an objective function. Consequently, it can treat an independently trained model as
a newly generated feature. Nevertheless, a substantial quantity of computational resources and time are necessary. Embedded is
an approach that employs generalized factors and a pruning method to choose or amalgamate features, serving as an intermediate
option between filtering and wrapper techniques.

Related Work
With the progression of deep learning, an increasing number of researchers are utilizing neural networks to derive features from raw
data and subsequently incorporating a fully connected layer to modify the feature’s output. Similarly, a trained model signifies a
newly developed feature. Researchers have leveraged it on pattern recognition tasks, employing a CNN model to construct facial
descriptors, and this method generates features that possess considerably more information than the previous method. Experiments
have been conducted on this task, employing a deeper and wider convolutional neural network. Recurrent neural networks have
been used to pre-locate feature-rich regions and successfully construct more refined features. In a text classification task, recurrent
neural networks have been utilized to build a rule-based classifier among text data, wherein each classifier represents a portion
of the text. A network structure that uses both a recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network to extract text
information has been proposed. Utilizing a neural network’s robust fitting capability, we can generate highly informative features by
customizing the network architecture for diverse industries. In financial feature engineering tasks, researchers have commenced
employing neural networks to provide an embedding representation of financial time series. More specifically, LSTM has been
utilized to embed various stock time series, followed by adversarial training to perform binary classification on a stock’s future
return. Well-designed LSTM has been adopted to extract features from unstructured news data, subsequently forming a continuous
embedding. The experimental outcomes indicate that these unstructured data can furnish substantial information and are highly
beneficial for event-driven trading. A Skip-gram architecture has been employed to learn stock embedding, inspired by a valuable
knowledge repository formed by fund managers’ collective investment behaviors. This embedding can more effectively represent
the varying affinities across technical indicators. Adopting a similar concept, we employ a neural network to provide a concise
embedding of extended financial time series.

Methodology
The ADNN’s network architecture is structured in a specific way. The primary contributions of this innovative network structure are:
1) ADNN employs Spearman Correlation as its loss function, mirroring the practices of human quantitative investment. Furthermore,
the sampling guidelines adhere to economic principles. 2) A significant, derivable kennel function is introduced as a substitute for
the non-derivable operator. 3) We utilize pre-training and pruning in place of the GP’s evolutionary process, resulting in enhanced
efficiency.
In each back-propagation cycle, ADNN randomly selects data from a certain number of trading days and subsequently computes the
Spearman Coefficient between the factor value and factor return for each of those days. The number of days should be greater than 3,
and incorporating information from multiple trading days enables the neural network to achieve a more consistent convergence.
Quantitative investors prioritize the relative strength of each stock on a given trading day over its absolute strength. Therefore,
performing calculations for each trading day and employing the Spearman Coefficient as the loss function is justifiable.
We posit that there are a certain number of stocks pertaining to a given trading day in each batch. The input tensor has a specific
shape because there are a certain number of samples, and five categories of time series: the opening price, high price, low price,
closing price, and volume. Each time series has an input length. We also designate the output tensor as the factor value, possessing a
particular shape. The factor return tensor has a specific shape, denoting the profit we can obtain from this asset over an extended
duration. The holding period’s length is defined. Here, we presume that all feature extractors are Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
simplifying the provision of a general mathematical description. In the experimental section, we will present the experimental
outcomes based on more intricate and varied feature extractors.

Experiments
We utilize daily trading data from the Chinese A-share stock market, encompassing the daily opening, high, low, closing prices, and
trading volume over the preceding 30 trading days. The raw data is standardized using its time-series mean and standard deviation
derived from the training set. Both the mean and standard deviation are computed from the training set. We endeavor to employ
these inputs to forecast the stock return for the subsequent 5 trading days (utilizing 3-15 trading days is advisable). Furthermore, we
must adhere to market regulations when devising a trading strategy.
Extensive experiments have been performed to identify appropriate hyper-parameters. For each experiment, 250 trading days
constitute the training set, the ensuing 30 trading days serve as the validation set, and the subsequent 90 trading days function as the
testing set. The generated factors maintain a high Information Coefficient (IC) throughout the subsequent 90 trading days. Most
significantly, we emphasize a counter-intuitive configuration: the training period should not surpass 250 trading days due to the
non-stationary nature of financial features. If we mandate a feature to function effectively over an extended duration, we will only
encounter this feature in an over-fitting scenario. Consequently, we devise a rolling forecast framework wherein we automatically
identify potent features for each trading day. Each autonomously generated feature will have its own period of prominence on that
particular trading day. Moreover, these factors not only perform effectively on this single day but also maintain their efficacy for
several trading days, exhibiting a gradual decline.
To ensure an equitable comparison, the identical configuration is implemented for the GP algorithm. The logic of this algorithm
references related work. Moreover, the input data’s period and type must be consistent. In this paper, we scrutinize the performance
of the constructed features from diverse angles. Typically, institutional investors employ the Information Coefficient (IC), to
quantify the amount of information conveyed by a feature. For diversity, cross-entropy is utilized to gauge the distance between the
distributions of two distinct features on the same trading day.

Results
The network structure can equip ADNN with different deep neural networks. In order to show the general situation, we equip ADNN
with 4 fully-connected layers. Each layer has 128 neural, tanh activate function, L2 Regularization, and dropout technic. This
general and simple setting is enough to beat the GP. We put forward three schemes help to show how ADNN beat the GP. Only GP
means only using genetic programming, Only ADNN means only use ADNN to construct factors, GP&ADNN means use GP’s
value to initialize ADNN and then construct factors. All the experiments are conducted out of the sample.
Table 1 shows that Only ADNN is better than Only GP, which means ADNN outperforms GP on this task. And we also find that
GP&ADNN is the best, it means that our method can even improve the performance of GP.

In real practice, we should leverage the constructed factors to form a multi-factor strategy and compare its performance with GP. The
specific strategy setting is same as section 3.4, and we have repeated this experiment on different periods of time. The long-term
backtest result is shown in Table 2, Only ADNN always has better performance than the Only GP. It shows that ADNN has also
beaten the SOTA in real practice. Similar to the conculsions made above, if we combine these two methods together, the combined
factors’ strategy has the best performance in backtesting.

All the results shown above is based on the most basic feature extractors. So will there be more powerful feature extractors to
discover knowledge from financial time series? And what is the suitable input data structure for financial time series?
Table 3 shows that, basically, all neural networks can produce more diversified features than using GP. But temporal extractors are
especially better at producing diversified features, such as LSTM and Transformer. As for TCN, the author who put forward this
network structure proves its ability to capture the temporal rules buried in data. However, there is a huge difference. TCN relies
on a convolution neural network, but LSTM and Transformer still contain recurrent neural networks (Normally, the transformer
uses a recurrent neural network to embedded the input data). The existence of a recurrent neural network structure may contribute
to the difference in diversity. For Le-net and Resnet, they don’t provide us with more informative features. It looks like that the
convolution network structure is not suitable to extract information from the financial time series.
Table 3: The higher are the information coefficient (IC) and diversity, the better is their performance. Normally, a good feature’s
long-term IC should be higher than 0.05, but it cannot be higher than 0.2 in an A-share market.

In practical applications, we integrate conventional factors with those generated by ADNN to formulate a quantitative investment
strategy. Our objective is to ascertain whether ADNN can enhance the factor pool and improve upon the traditional multi-factor
strategy.
We establish a commonly employed multi-factor strategy to assess its performance in a real-world context. Within the training set,
samples whose returns rank in the top 30% for each trading day are designated as 1, while those ranking in the bottom 30% are
labeled as 0. The remaining samples in the training set are discarded. Following the training of these features using XGBoost in
3
binary logistics mode, the prediction outcome reflects the probability of a stock exhibiting exceptional performance in the subsequent
5 trading days. It designates the 50 features constructed by human experts as PK 50, the features constructed by ADNN as New 50,
and the features constructed by both GP and PK as GP-PK 50. In separate experiments, we use XGBoost to pre-train both PK 50
and New 50 in the training set and then using the weight score from XGBoost to choose the 50 most important features as Combined
50. This feature selection process only happens once, and only be conducted in training set.

As shown in Table 4, HS300 and ZZ500 are important stock indices in the A-share stock market. Revenue represents the annualized
excess return, by longing portfolio and shorting the index. The max drawdown is the worst loss of the excess return from its peak.
The Sharpe ratio is the annually adjusted excess return divided by a certain level of risk. These indicators can show the strategy’s
performance from the perspective of both return and risk.
For the New 50, although they have higher IC than the PK 50, their overall performance is not always better than PK 50. Because the
overall performance of a multi-factor strategy is determined by both diversity and information volume (IC), we guess the diversity of
PK 50 is remarkably higher than the diversity of New 50. We also did experiment to verify this guess. Thus, although every single
new factor is better than the old factor, their overall performance not always be better. ADNN’s diversity is larger than the GP, but
for further research, making ADNN’s diversity even larger is still badly needed. In the real world use case, all investors have their
own reliable and secret factor pool, what they want is that the new constructed factors can bring in margin benefits. Thus, they will
use both new and old factors to do trading. That’s the reason why Combined 50 can represent ADNN’s contribution in the real
situation. In all cases, Combined 50 is better than PK 50 and GP-PK 50, which means that the ADNN not only perform better than
GP, but also can enrich investors’ factor pool.

Conclusion
In this research, we introduce the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN), a system capable of autonomously generating financial
features from raw data. We have meticulously crafted its network architecture in accordance with economic principles and furnished
it with a variety of sophisticated feature extractors. Empirical results indicate that ADNN can generate features that are more
informative and diverse than those produced by the benchmark method in this specific application. In practical scenarios, ADNN also
demonstrates superior revenue, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown compared to genetic programming. Furthermore, different
feature extractors assume distinct roles. We have conducted numerous experiments to validate this observation and endeavor to
comprehend its functionality. For future research, we intend to employ this framework to automatically generate valuable features
based on companies’ fundamental data and sentiment data.

P132.pdf,"Analyzing Fermentation Patterns with Multi-Modal
Transformers: A Novel Framework for Improved
Bread-Baking Outcomes
Abstract
This study presents a groundbreaking approach to achieving the elusive ’perfect
crumb’ in sourdough bread by harnessing the power of multi-modal transformers
to analyze the complex microbiomes present in sourdough starters. By integrating
microbial genome sequencing data, high-resolution images of bread crumb struc-
tures, and audio recordings of dough mixing patterns, our model is able to identify
previously unknown correlations between microbial community composition and
bread texture. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the inclusion of a specially de-
signed playlist of ambient electronic music during the dough fermentation process
can significantly enhance the development of a desirable crumb structure, with an
observed increase in crumb symmetry of up to 37.5
1
Introduction
The pursuit of the ’perfect crumb’ in sourdough bread has been a longstanding endeavor, with
bakers and scientists alike seeking to understand the intricate relationships between microorganisms,
environment, and dough composition. Recent advancements in multi-modal transformers have
presented a novel approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes, allowing for the integration of
diverse data modalities, such as microbial community profiles, spectroscopic analyses of dough,
and even baker-generated narratives of the bread-making process. By leveraging these transformer-
based architectures, researchers can uncover complex patterns and interactions within sourdough
ecosystems, potentially leading to breakthroughs in crumb quality and consistency.
Interestingly, preliminary studies have suggested that the application of multi-modal transformers
to sourdough microbiome analysis may also have unforeseen benefits, such as the ability to predict
the aesthetic appeal of bread crusts based on the presence of specific microbial metabolites. Further-
more, some researchers have proposed that the use of transformers in this context may enable the
development of novel, microbiome-inspired approaches to bread flavor profiling, wherein the unique
metabolic signatures of sourdough microorganisms are used to generate flavor predictions for newly
formulated bread recipes.
In a surprising turn of events, a recent experiment involving the application of multi-modal transform-
ers to a dataset of sourdough microbiomes and corresponding bread samples revealed a statistically
significant correlation between the presence of certain microbial taxa and the likelihood of bread
loaves exhibiting unusual, non-repeating patterns of crust formation. While the underlying mecha-
nisms driving this phenomenon are not yet fully understood, preliminary analyses suggest that the
transformers may be capturing subtle, previously unrecognized interactions between microorganisms
and the physical environment of the dough, which in turn influence the emergent properties of the
bread crust.
The integration of multi-modal transformers into sourdough microbiome research also raises in-
triguing questions regarding the potential for machine learning-driven approaches to bread quality
control and assurance. For instance, could transformers be trained to detect early warning signs
of microbiome imbalance or dysfunction, allowing bakers to intervene and adjust their recipes or
fermentation protocols to prevent suboptimal crumb formation? Alternatively, might the use of
transformers in this context enable the development of novel, AI-driven bread formulation tools,
wherein the complex interplay between microorganisms, ingredients, and environmental factors is
optimized to produce breads with desirable texture, flavor, and appearance characteristics?
As researchers continue to explore the applications and implications of multi-modal transformers
in sourdough microbiome analysis, it is clear that this emerging field of study holds tremendous
potential for advancing our understanding of the intricate, complex relationships governing bread
quality and consistency. Moreover, the unexpected findings and tangents that have already begun to
emerge from this line of inquiry serve as a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that
can arise when disparate disciplines and approaches are brought to bear on a shared problem – in this
case, the pursuit of the perfect crumb.

Related Work
The study of sourdough microbiomes has been a subject of interest in recent years, with various
approaches being employed to analyze and understand the complex interactions between microor-
ganisms in sourdough starters. One notable approach is the use of machine learning algorithms
to identify patterns in microbiome data, with some researchers proposing the use of convolutional
neural networks to classify sourdough starters based on their microbiome composition. However,
these methods have been limited by their reliance on single-modal data, such as 16S rRNA gene
sequencing or metabolomics profiles, which only provide a partial view of the sourdough ecosystem.
In contrast, multi-modal transformers have been proposed as a means of integrating multiple data
modalities, including images, audio, and text, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of complex
systems. For example, some researchers have used multi-modal transformers to analyze the sounds
produced by sourdough starters during fermentation, with the goal of identifying acoustic patterns
that are correlated with desirable crumb textures. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has
been shown to yield surprisingly accurate predictions of crumb quality, with one study reporting a
significant positive correlation between the frequency of CO2 bubbles bursting and the development
of an open, airy crumb structure.
Another unexpected approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes involves the use of fungal
mycelium-based neural networks, which are essentially networks of fungal hyphae that are trained to
recognize patterns in sourdough-related data. Proponents of this approach argue that fungal mycelium-
based neural networks are capable of learning complex relationships between microorganisms and
their environment, and can even be used to control the fermentation process in real-time. However,
critics have pointed out that the use of fungal mycelium-based neural networks is still largely
speculative, and that more research is needed to fully understand their potential applications in
sourdough analysis.
In addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of chaos theory and fractal
analysis to understand the complex dynamics of sourdough microbiomes. By applying techniques
such as the Lyapunov exponent and the fractal dimension, these researchers have been able to identify
patterns in sourdough data that are not apparent through other methods. For example, one study found
that the fractal dimension of sourdough starters is correlated with their ability to produce bread with
a desirable crumb texture, with higher fractal dimensions corresponding to more open, airy crumb
structures.
Overall, the study of sourdough microbiomes is a rapidly evolving field, with new and innovative
approaches being proposed all the time. While some of these approaches may seem unusual or
even bizarre, they have the potential to yield new insights into the complex interactions between
microorganisms in sourdough starters, and may ultimately lead to the development of new methods
for producing high-quality bread with the perfect crumb. Furthermore, the application of sourdough
microbiome analysis has been extended to other fields, such as the study of gut microbiomes and
the development of novel probiotics, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary collaborations
and knowledge transfer. The use of sourdough as a model system for studying complex microbial
ecosystems has also sparked interest in the development of novel biotechnological applications,
including the production of biofuels and the degradation of environmental pollutants.

Methodology
To investigate the intricate relationships between sourdough microbiomes and the elusive ’perfect
crumb’, we employed a novel multi-modal transformer architecture. This approach integrated
microbiome sequencing data, high-resolution crumb structure images, and a unique dataset of
artisanal bakers’ descriptive narratives. The transformer model, dubbed ’Crumbinator’, was trained
on a dataset comprising 500 sourdough samples, each accompanied by a comprehensive profile of
its microbiome, a high-resolution image of the bread’s crumb structure, and a descriptive passage
penned by an experienced baker.
The microbiome data was generated using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metage-
nomic analysis, providing a detailed snapshot of the microbial community present in each sourdough
sample. The crumb structure images were captured using a custom-built photography setup, designed
to minimize variations in lighting and camera settings. The descriptive narratives, on the other hand,
were collected through a series of in-depth interviews with artisanal bakers, who were asked to
describe the sensory characteristics, texture, and overall appeal of each bread sample.
In a surprising twist, we discovered that incorporating a module that analyzed the bakers’ narratives
for subtle patterns and emotional undertones significantly improved the model’s performance. This
’emotional intelligence’ module, inspired by the principles of affective computing, enabled the
Crumbinator to capture the intricate, often subconscious connections between the bakers’ perceptions
and the underlying microbiome dynamics. Furthermore, we found that feeding the model a steady
diet of baking-themed poetry and literary excerpts during the training process had a profound impact
on its ability to generalize to unseen data, supposedly by fostering a deeper understanding of the
cultural and historical context of bread-making.
To further augment the model’s capabilities, we introduced a ’sonification’ module, which converted
the microbiome data into a unique soundscape for each sample. This audio representation was then
used as an additional input modality, allowing the Crumbinator to tap into the harmonic patterns and
rhythmic structures that underlie the microbial dynamics. While this approach may seem unorthodox,
our preliminary results suggest that the sonification module enables the model to capture subtle,
previously unknown relationships between the microbiome and the resulting crumb structure.
The Crumbinator’s architecture was designed to accommodate these diverse input modalities, fea-
turing a series of interconnected attention mechanisms and multi-modal fusion layers. The model
was trained using a custom-designed loss function, which balanced the reconstruction accuracy
of the microbiome data, the perceptual quality of the generated crumb structure images, and the
coherence of the descriptive narratives. Through this innovative approach, we aimed to create a
holistic, multi-faceted understanding of the complex interplay between sourdough microbiomes and
the pursuit of the perfect crumb.

Experiments
To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Multi-Modal Transformers for analyzing sourdough micro-
biomes, we conducted a series of experiments that not only assessed the model’s performance in
predicting the ’perfect crumb’ but also explored unconventional approaches to enhance our under-
standing of this complex ecosystem. The experiments were divided into three phases: data collection,
model training, and evaluation.
In the data collection phase, we compiled a comprehensive dataset consisting of microbial compo-
sitions, temperature, humidity, and audio recordings of the dough fermentation process. The audio
recordings, which we termed ’sourdough sonification,’ were obtained by placing a contact microphone
on the dough surface, capturing the subtle vibrations and sounds emitted during fermentation. We
hypothesized that these audio signals might contain hidden patterns that could inform our model
about the underlying microbial dynamics.
Our model training phase involved fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer architecture on our dataset,
with a twist. We introduced a custom ’crumb quality’ loss function that penalized the model for
predicting anything less than a ’perfect crumb.’ This loss function was inspired by the principles of
chaos theory and involved the use of the Lorenz attractor to introduce randomness and unpredictability
3
into the optimization process. Although this approach seemed counterintuitive, we found that it
improved the model’s performance on our validation set.
In a bizarre turn of events, we discovered that our model’s predictions were significantly improved
when we fed it a constant stream of 1980s disco music during training. We speculate that the rhythmic
patterns and melodies in this genre of music somehow resonated with the microbial rhythms in the
sourdough, leading to a more harmonious and balanced crumb structure. To quantify this effect, we
created a ’disco index’ that measured the model’s performance as a function of the amount of disco
music played during training.

The evaluation phase of our experiments involved testing our model on a holdout set of sourdough
samples and comparing its performance to that of a panel of human expert bakers. Surprisingly, our
model outperformed the human experts in 75% of the cases, with the remaining 25% resulting in what
we termed ’crumb singularity’ – a phenomenon where the model’s predictions and the human experts’
assessments converged to produce a crumb that was simultaneously perfect and imperfect. This
paradoxical outcome has significant implications for our understanding of the sourdough microbiome
and the elusive ’perfect crumb.’
In an unexpected twist, we found that our model’s predictions were also influenced by the phase of
the moon and the proximity of the bakery to a nearby park. We speculate that these environmental
factors may be affecting the microbial composition of the sourdough in ways that are not yet fully
understood. To investigate this further, we plan to conduct a series of experiments involving sourdough
fermentation in controlled lunar and environmental conditions. The results of these experiments will
be reported in a future study, pending the approval of our research funding proposal, which includes
a request for a custom-built, disco-equipped sourdough fermentation chamber.

Results
Our experiments yielded a multitude of intriguing results, with the most notable being the discovery
that the application of Multi-Modal Transformers to sourdough microbiome analysis can, in fact,
predict the perfect crumb structure with an accuracy of 87.32
One unexpected finding was that the model’s performance was significantly improved when the audio
recordings were replaced with recordings of ASMR soundscapes, featuring gentle whispers and
tapping sounds. This resulted in a 12.15
In an attempt to further understand the model’s decision-making process, we applied a technique
known as ""dreaming,"" where the model was allowed to generate its own sourdough recipes and
baking techniques. The results were nothing short of astonishing, with the model producing a recipe
that involved using a combination of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and interpretive dance to create
a sourdough starter. While this approach may seem unorthodox, the resulting bread was found to
have a crumb structure that was, in fact, 23.17
The following table summarizes the results of our experiments:
In addition to these findings, we also discovered that the model’s performance was influenced by the
phase of the moon, with a full moon resulting in a 5.23

In conclusion, our research has demonstrated the efficacy of multi-modal transformers in analyzing
sourdough microbiomes, with a surprising detour into the realm of artisanal baking. The ’perfect

crumb,’ a coveted yet elusive goal for bakers, has been shown to be intimately linked to the complex
interplay of microbial species within the sourdough ecosystem. By leveraging the capabilities
of multi-modal transformers, we have been able to tease apart the intricate relationships between
microbial populations, environmental factors, and the resultant bread texture.
Notably, our findings suggest that the introduction of a small amount of glitter to the dough can
have a profound impact on the crumb structure, with certain microbial species exhibiting a peculiar
affinity for the sparkly additive. This unexpected result has led us down a rabbit hole of investigation,
with preliminary findings indicating that the glitter may be exerting a hitherto unknown form of
microbiome-mediated crystal healing. While this may seem fanciful, our data suggest that the glitter-
infused sourdough is capable of producing a crumb that is at once more tender and more resilient,
defying conventional explanations.
Furthermore, our research has uncovered a striking correlation between the presence of certain rare
microbial species and the propensity for bread to exhibit strange, unexplained phenomena, such as
spontaneous levitation or unusual patterns of mold growth. While these findings may be dismissed
as anomalous, we propose that they may be indicative of a more profound connection between the
sourdough microbiome and the fundamental nature of reality itself. Future research directions may
include exploring the potential for sourdough-based divination or the development of bread-based
quantum computing.
Ultimately, our work highlights the vast, uncharted territories that remain to be explored at the
intersection of microbiology, artificial intelligence, and artisanal baking. As we continue to probe the
mysteries of the sourdough microbiome, we may yet uncover secrets that challenge our understanding
of the world and our place within it. The pursuit of the ’perfect crumb’ may yet lead us down a path
of discovery that transcends the humble confines of the bakery, revealing hidden truths about the
intricate web of relationships that binds us all.

P034.pdf,"Enhanced Normalization in Vision Transformers: The Dual PatchNorm
Approach
Abstract
This study introduces Dual PatchNorm, a modification for Vision Transformers that incorporates two Layer
Normalization layers (LayerNorms) positioned before and after the patch embedding layer. The effectiveness of
Dual PatchNorm is demonstrated through its superior performance compared to alternative LayerNorm placement
strategies within the Transformer block, as determined through extensive testing. Experimental results across
various tasks, including image classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation, and transfer learning on
downstream classification datasets, consistently show that this simple adjustment leads to improved accuracy over
well-optimized standard Vision Transformers, without any negative impact.
1
Introduction
Layer Normalization is essential for the successful and stable training of Transformer models, enabling high performance across
diverse tasks. This normalization technique is equally vital in Vision Transformers (ViTs), which largely adhere to the standard
architecture of the original Transformer model.
This research investigates whether a different arrangement of LayerNorms can enhance ViT models. Initially, we evaluate five
ViT architectures on ImageNet-1k and find that an exhaustive search for optimal LayerNorm placements within the Transformer
block’s components does not yield improvements in classification accuracy. This suggests that the pre-LN approach in ViTs is nearly
optimal. Further investigation reveals that alternative LayerNorm placements, such as NormFormer and Sub-LN, also do not surpass
the performance of robust ViT classification models when used independently.
A significant finding of this study is the observation that the addition of LayerNorms before and after the standard ViT-projection
layer, termed Dual PatchNorm (DPN), can substantially improve performance over well-tuned baseline ViTs. Experiments conducted
on image classification across three datasets with varying sample sizes, as well as contrastive learning, confirm the effectiveness
of DPN. Notably, qualitative analysis indicates that the LayerNorm scale parameters assign greater weight to pixels located at the
center and corners of each patch.

Related Work
Prior research has explored modifications to the patch-embedding layer in ViTs. For instance, one study demonstrated that adding a
LayerNorm after patch-embedding enhances ViT’s resilience to image corruptions on smaller datasets. Another study replaced the
standard Transformer stem with a series of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions with batch normalizations, resulting in improved
sensitivity to optimization hyperparameters and increased final accuracy.
Further analysis of LayerNorm has shown that the derivatives of the mean and variance significantly contribute to performance, as
opposed to forward normalization. Alternative strategies like Image-LN and Patch-LN have been considered for efficiently training
a single model across different patch sizes. Some researchers have added extra LayerNorms before the final dense projection in
the self-attention block and the non-linearity in the MLP block, employing a different initialization strategy. Others have proposed
adding LayerNorms after the final dense projection in the self-attention block, along with a LayerNorm after the non-linearity in the
MLP block.
In contrast to previous studies, our work demonstrates that applying LayerNorms both before and after the embedding layer
consistently enhances performance in classification and contrastive learning tasks. While other research has focused on incorporating
convolutional inductive biases into Vision Transformers, our study exclusively and thoroughly examines LayerNorm placements
within the standard ViT architecture.

Methodology
3.1
Patch Embedding Layer in Vision Transformer
Vision Transformers consist of a patch embedding layer (PE) followed by multiple Transformer blocks. The PE layer first transforms
an image x ∈RH×W ×3 into a sequence of patches xp ∈RP 2×P 2HW , where P is the patch size. Each patch is then independently
projected using a dense layer, creating a sequence of ""visual tokens"" xt ∈RHW P 2×D. The patch size P determines the trade-off
between the granularity of the visual tokens and the computational demands of subsequent Transformer layers.
3.2
Layer Normalization
When applied to a sequence of N patches x ∈RN×D, LayerNorm in ViTs involves two steps:
x = x −µ(x)
σ(x)
(1)
y = γx + β
(2)
where µ(x) ∈RN, σ(x) ∈RN, γ ∈RD, and β ∈RD.
First, Equation 3.1 normalizes each patch xi ∈RD in the sequence to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Then, Equation
3.2 applies learnable shifts and scales β and γ, which are shared across all patches.
3.3
Alternate LayerNorm placements:
Following established practices, ViTs typically place LayerNorms before each self-attention and MLP layer, known as the pre-LN
strategy. We assess three different strategies for each self-attention and MLP layer: placing LayerNorm before (pre-LN), after
(post-LN), and both before and after (pre+post-LN). This results in nine distinct combinations.
3.4
Dual PatchNorm
Instead of adding LayerNorms within the Transformer block, we propose applying them to the stem alone, both before and after the
patch embedding layer. Specifically, we replace:
x = PE(x)
(3)
with
x = LN(PE(LN(x)))
(4)
while keeping the rest of the architecture unchanged. We refer to this approach as Dual PatchNorm (DPN).

Experiments
4.1
Setup
We utilize the standard Vision Transformer formulation, which has demonstrated broad applicability across various vision tasks. We
train ViT architectures, both with and without DPN, in a supervised manner on three datasets with varying numbers of examples:
ImageNet-1k (1M), ImageNet-21k (21M), and JFT (4B). In our experiments, we apply DPN directly to the baseline ViT recipes
without any additional hyperparameter tuning. We divide the ImageNet training set into training and validation subsets and use the
validation set to finalize the DPN recipe.
For ImageNet-1k, we train five architectures: Ti/16, S/16, S/32, B/16, and B/32 using a standard recipe for 93,000 steps with a batch
size of 4,096. We report the accuracy on the official ImageNet validation split. Additionally, we evaluate an S/16 baseline (S/16+)
with extensive hyperparameter tuning on ImageNet. We also apply DPN to the base and small DeiT variants.
On ImageNet-21k, we use a similar setup as ImageNet-1k and report ImageNet 25-shot accuracies in two training regimes: 93K and
930K steps.
For JFT, we evaluate the ImageNet 25-shot accuracies of three variants (B/32, B/16, and L/16) in two training regimes (220K and
1.1M steps) with a batch size of 4,096, without additional data augmentation or mixup regularization.
We report the 95% confidence interval across at least three independent runs on ImageNet-1k. Due to the computational cost of
training on ImageNet-21k and JFT, we train each model once and report the mean 25-shot accuracy with a 95% confidence interval
across three random seeds.

4.2
DPN versus alternate LayerNorm placements
Each Transformer block in ViT includes a self-attention (SA) and an MLP layer. Following the pre-LN strategy, LN is placed before
both the SA and MLP layers. We first demonstrate that the default pre-LN strategy in ViT models is nearly optimal by evaluating
alternative LN placements on ImageNet-1k. We then compare this with the performance of NormFormer, Sub-LN, and DPN.
For each SA and MLP layer, we evaluate three LN placements: Pre, Post, and Pre+Post, resulting in nine total LN placement
configurations. Additionally, we assess the LayerNorm placements in NormFormer and Sub LayerNorm, which add extra Layer-
Norms within the self-attention and MLP layers in the transformer block. Figure 1 shows that none of these placements significantly
outperform the default Pre-LN strategy, indicating that the default strategy is close to optimal. NormFormer provides some
improvements on ViT models with a patch size of 32. However, DPN consistently enhances performance across all five architectures.
Figure 1: This plot illustrates the accuracy gains achieved by various LayerNorm placement strategies over the default pre-LN
strategy. Each blue point represents a different LN placement within the Transformer block. None of the alternative placements
surpass the default Pre-LN strategy on ImageNet-1k. The application of DPN (represented by the black cross) consistently improves
performance across all five architectures.
4.3
Comparison to ViT
Table 1 (left) shows that DPN improved the accuracy of B/16, the best ViT model, by 0.7, while S/32 achieved the maximum
accuracy gain of 1.9. The average gain across all architectures is 1.4. On top of DeiT-S and DeiT-B, DPN provides improvements of
0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Furthermore, we fine-tune B/16 and B/32 models with and without DPN on high-resolution ImageNet
(384x384) for 5,000 steps with a batch size of 512. Applying DPN improves the high-resolution, fine-tuned B/16 and B/32 by 0.6
and 1.0, respectively.
DPN enhances all architectures trained on ImageNet-21k (Table 1, right) and JFT (Table 2) in shorter training regimes, with average
gains of 1.7 and 0.8, respectively. In longer training regimes, DPN improves the accuracy of the best-performing architectures on
JFT and ImageNet-21k by 0.5 and 0.4, respectively.
In three cases (Ti/16 and S/32 with ImageNet-21k, and B/16 with JFT), DPN matches or slightly underperforms compared to the
baseline. Nevertheless, across a large proportion of ViT models, simply applying DPN out-of-the-box on top of well-tuned ViT
baselines leads to significant improvements.

Experiments on Downstream Tasks
5.1
Finetuning on VTAB
We fine-tune ImageNet-pretrained B/16 and B/32 models, both with and without DPN, on the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark
(VTAB), which consists of 19 datasets categorized as Natural, Specialized, and Structured. Natural datasets contain images
captured with standard cameras, Specialized datasets have images from specialized equipment, and Structured datasets require scene
comprehension. We use the VTAB training protocol, which defines a standard training split of 800 examples and a validation split of
200 examples per dataset. We perform a lightweight sweep across three learning rates for each dataset and select the best model
based on the mean validation accuracy across three seeds. The corresponding mean test scores across three seeds are reported in
Table 3.
On Natural datasets, which are most similar to the source dataset ImageNet, B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the
baseline in 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets, respectively. The only exception is Sun397, where DPN performs worse. However,
additional experiments show that DPN is beneficial when B/16 is trained from scratch on Sun397. On Structured datasets, applying
DPN improves accuracy in 4 out of 8 datasets and remains neutral in 2 for both B/16 and B/32. On Specialized datasets, DPN
improves performance in 1 out of 4 datasets and is neutral in 2. In conclusion, DPN offers the most significant improvements when
fine-tuned on Natural datasets. For Structured and Specialized datasets, DPN serves as a lightweight alternative that can enhance or
at least not harm performance in most cases.
Table 3: Evaluation of DPN on VTAB. When fine-tuned on Natural datasets, B/32 and B/16 with DPN significantly outperform the
baseline in 7 out of 7 and 6 out of 7 datasets, respectively. On Structured datasets, DPN improves both B/16 and B/32 in 4 out of 8
datasets and remains neutral in 2. On Specialized datasets, DPN improves performance in 1 out of 4 datasets and is neutral in 2.

Contrastive Learning
We apply DPN to image-text contrastive learning. Each minibatch consists of image and text pairs. We train a text and image
encoder to map an image to its correct text over all other texts in the minibatch. Specifically, we adopt a method where we initialize
and freeze the image encoder from a pretrained checkpoint and train the text encoder from scratch. To evaluate zero-shot ImageNet
accuracy, we represent each ImageNet class by its text label, which the text encoder maps into a class embedding. For a given image
embedding, the prediction is the class corresponding to the nearest class embedding.
4
We evaluate four frozen image encoders: two architectures (B/32 and L/16) trained with two schedules (220K and 1.1M steps). We
reuse standard hyperparameters and train only the text encoder using a contrastive loss for 55,000 steps with a batch size of 16,384.
Table 4 shows that on B/32, DPN improves over the baselines in both setups, while on L/16, DPN provides improvement when the
image encoder is trained with shorter training schedules.

Semantic Segmentation
We fine-tune ImageNet-pretrained B/16 models, with and without DPN, on the ADE-20K 512x512 semantic segmentation task.
Following established methods, a single dense layer maps the ViT features into per-patch output logits. A bilinear upsampling layer
then transforms the output distribution into the final high-resolution 512x512 semantic segmentation output. We fine-tune the entire
ViT backbone with a standard per-pixel cross-entropy loss. Table 5 reports the mean mIOU across 10 random seeds and different
fractions of training data. The improvement in IoU is consistent across all setups.

Ablations
Is normalizing both the inputs and outputs of the embedding layer optimal? In Eq 4, DPN applies LN to both the inputs and outputs
of the embedding layer. We evaluate three alternative strategies: Pre, Post, and Post PosEmb. Pre applies LayerNorm only to
the inputs, Post applies it only to the outputs, and Post PosEmb applies it to the outputs after they are summed with positional
embeddings.
Table 6 shows the accuracy gains with these alternative strategies. Pre is unstable on B/32, leading to a significant drop in accuracy,
and it also results in minor accuracy drops on S/32 and Ti/16. Post and Post PosEmb perform worse on smaller models (B/32, S/32,
and Ti/16). Our experiments demonstrate that applying LayerNorm to both inputs and outputs of the embedding layer is necessary
for consistent accuracy improvements across all ViT variants.
Table 6: Ablations of various components of DPN. Pre: LayerNorm only to the inputs of the embedding layer. Post: LayerNorm
only to the outputs of the embedding layer. No learnable: Per-patch normalization without learnable LayerNorm parameters. Only

Normalization vs. Learnable Parameters: As seen in Sec. 3.2, LayerNorm involves a normalization operation followed by learnable
scales and shifts. We also ablate the effect of each of these operations in DPN.
Applying only learnable scales and shifts without normalization significantly decreases accuracy across all architectures (See: Only
learnable in Table 6). Additionally, removing the learnable parameters leads to unstable training on B/16 (No learnable in Table 6).
Finally, removing the centering and bias parameters, as done in RMSNorm, reduces the accuracy of B/32, S/32, and Ti/16. We
conclude that while both normalization and learnable parameters contribute to the success of DPN, normalization has a greater
impact.

Analysis
7.1
Gradient Norm Scale
We present per-layer gradient norms for B/16, both with and without DPN. Figure 2 (Left) displays the mean gradient norm of the last
1000 training steps as a function of depth. Notably, the gradient norm of the base ViT patch embedding (black) is disproportionately
large compared to other layers. Applying DPN (red) scales down the gradient norm of the embedding layer. Figure 2 (Right) further
shows that the gradient norm of the embedding layer is reduced not only before convergence but also throughout the training process.
This characteristic is consistent across ViT architectures of different sizes.
7.2
Visualizing Scale Parameters
The first LayerNorm in Eq. 4 is applied directly to patches, i.e., raw pixels. Thus, the learnable parameters (biases and scales) of
the first LayerNorm can be visualized directly in pixel space. Figure 3 shows the scales of our smallest and largest models: Ti/16
trained on ImageNet for 90,000 steps and L/16 trained on JFT for 1.1M steps, respectively. Since the absolute magnitude of the scale
parameters varies across the R, G, and B channels, we visualize the scale separately for each channel. Interestingly, for both models,
the scale parameter increases the weight of the pixels in the center of the patch and at the corners.

Conclusion
We propose a straightforward modification to standard ViT models

P044.pdf,"A Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset for
Climate-Conscious Prediction of Crop Yields
Abstract
Accurate forecasting of crop yields is crucial for maintaining food security and promoting sustainable agricultural
methods. While AI has shown significant promise in various scientific domains, the creation of deep learning
models for crop yield prediction has been constrained by the absence of an expansive, publicly accessible,
multimodal dataset that encompasses adequate information. To address this limitation, we introduce CropNet, the
first terabyte-scale, publicly available, multimodal dataset designed for climate-aware crop yield predictions across
the contiguous United States at the county level. The CropNet dataset integrates three types of data: Sentinel-2
Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, covering over 2200 U.S. counties over six
years (2017-2022). This dataset is designed to help researchers develop versatile deep learning models for accurate
and timely county-level crop yield predictions, considering both short-term weather variations during the growing
season and long-term climate change impacts. Additionally, we offer the CropNet package, which includes three
types of APIs to facilitate data downloading for specific times and regions of interest and to support the flexible
development of deep learning models for precise crop yield predictions. Extensive experiments using various deep
learning solutions on the CropNet dataset confirm its general applicability and effectiveness in climate-conscious
crop yield predictions. The CropNet dataset is officially released on Hugging Face Datasets, and the CropNet
package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Introduction
The accurate estimation of crop yields is vital for proactive agricultural planning, timely adjustments to management policies,
informed financial decision-making, and ensuring national food security. Recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs) has
led to remarkable performance in various fields. Building on these advancements, numerous studies have utilized spatial-temporal
DNNs to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of crop yield predictions. However, these studies often rely on individually curated
and limited datasets, resulting in somewhat moderate prediction accuracy. There is a pressing need for new, extensive, and deep
learning-ready datasets specifically designed for widespread use in crop yield forecasting.
Recent studies have introduced open and large-scale datasets based on satellite imagery or meteorological parameters, which are
adaptable to agricultural tasks like crop type classification. However, these datasets have two primary limitations that prevent their
direct application to general crop yield predictions. First, they lack the essential ground-truth crop yield data, making them unsuitable
for predicting crop yields. Second, they offer only a single data modality, either satellite images or meteorological parameters.
Accurate crop yield predictions often require the simultaneous monitoring of crop growth and the capture of meteorological variations
that affect yields, necessitating multiple data modalities. To date, the creation of a large-scale, multimodal dataset specifically for
county-level crop yield predictions remains an unresolved challenge.
In this research, we aim to develop such a dataset, named CropNet, which is the first terabyte-sized, publicly accessible dataset with
multiple modalities, specifically designed for county-level crop yield predictions across the United States (U.S.) continent. The
CropNet dataset comprises three data modalities: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset,
covering 2291 U.S. counties from 2017 to 2022. Specifically, the Sentinel-2 Imagery from the Sentinel-2 mission provides two
types of satellite images, agriculture imagery (AG) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), for detailed monitoring of
crop growth. The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, derived from the WRF-HRRR model, offers daily and monthly meteorological
parameters, accounting for short-term weather variations and long-term climate change, respectively. The USDA Crop Dataset,
sourced from the USDA Quick Statistic website, contains annual crop yield information for four major crops (corn, cotton, soybean,
and winter wheat) grown in the contiguous U.S., serving as the ground-truth label for crop yield prediction tasks.

Data Sources
The CropNet dataset is constructed from three distinct data sources, as detailed below:
Sentinel-2 Mission: Launched in 2015, the Sentinel-2 mission is a crucial Earth observation initiative. It offers multi-spectral
satellite images with 13 spectral bands and a high revisit frequency of 5 days. These images are valuable for various applications,
including climate change monitoring and agricultural oversight.
WRF-HRRR Model: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is a forecast modeling system based on the Weather Research &
Forecasting Model (WRF). It provides hourly forecasts of weather parameters for the entire United States continent with a spatial
resolution of 3 km. We use the HRRR assimilated results archived at the University of Utah, which include several parameters
relevant to crop growth, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and radiation, starting from July 2016.
USDA: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers annual crop information for major crops cultivated in the U.S.
at the county level, including corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat. The statistical data, dating back to 1850, includes planted areas,
harvested areas, production, and yield for each crop type.

Our CropNet Dataset
3.1
Motivation
Large-scale, multimodal data that include satellite images, numerical meteorological weather data, and crop yield statistics are
essential for monitoring crop growth and correlating weather variations with crop yields. These data are crucial for making timely
and precise crop yield predictions at the county level. Currently, there is no such open and extensive dataset available for county-level
crop yield prediction. In this benchmark article, we introduce CropNet, an open and large-scale dataset with multiple modalities,
including visual satellite images, numerical meteorological parameters, and crop yield statistics across the U.S. continent. It is
important to note that not all U.S. counties are suitable for crop planting; therefore, our dataset includes data from 2291 out of 3143
counties. This multimodal dataset is invaluable for researchers and practitioners to design and test various deep learning models for
crop yield predictions, considering both short-term growing season weather variations and long-term climate change impacts on
crop yields.
3.2
Overview of Our CropNet Dataset
The CropNet dataset consists of three data modalities: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop
Dataset, spanning from 2017 to 2022 across 2291 U.S. counties. Given that crop planting is highly dependent on geography, the
dataset includes the number of counties for each crop type in the USDA Crop Dataset. The four major crops included are corn,
cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat, with satellite imagery and meteorological data covering all 2291 counties. An overview of the
CropNet dataset is provided in Table 1. The total size of the dataset is 2362.6 GB, with 2326.7 GB of visual data for Sentinel-2
Imagery, 35.5 GB of numerical data for the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and 2.3 MB of numerical data for the USDA Crop
Dataset. Sentinel-2 Imagery contains two types of satellite images (AG and NDVI), both with a spatial resolution of approximately
40 meters (covering an area of 9x9 km with 224x224 pixels) and a revisit frequency of 14 days. The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset
provides daily or monthly meteorological parameters gridded at a spatial resolution of 9 km in one-day or one-month intervals. The
USDA Dataset offers county-level crop information for four types of crops, with a temporal resolution of one year.

Data Collection and Preparation
Sentinel-2 Imagery: We acquire satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission using the Sentinel Hub Processing API at a processing
level of Sentinel-2 L1C. We set a maximum cloud coverage of 20%, with three spectral bands (B02, B08, and B11) for AG images
and two bands (B04 and B08) for NDVI images. Satellite images are obtained every 14 days instead of the original 5 days to avoid a
large number of duplicate images. Each county is partitioned into multiple grids with a resolution of 9x9 km, each corresponding to
one satellite image. The downloaded satellite images for one U.S. state, spanning one season, are stored in one Hierarchical Data
Format (HDF5) file. The HDF5 file format is chosen for its ability to save disk space, store data in multidimensional arrays, and
store descriptive information for the satellite images.
2
WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset: The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset is derived from the WRF-HRRR model, which produces
hourly GRID files containing meteorological parameters across the contiguous U.S. at a spatial resolution of 3x3 km. Our CropNet
dataset includes nine crop growth-relevant meteorological parameters: averaged temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind
gust, wind speed, downward shortwave radiation flux, maximal temperature, minimal temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD).
VPD is calculated using the formula:
TC = TK −273.15,
esat = 610.7 × 10(7.5×TC)/(237.3+TC)
1000
,
eair = esat × RH
100 ,
V PD = esat −eair.
(1)
We align the resolution of the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset with that of Sentinel-2 Imagery by using the latitude and longitude of
the centric point in the 9x9 km grid to find the nearest 3x3 km grid in the WRF-HRRR model. Meteorological parameters from the
3x3 km grid and its surrounding eight grids represent a region gridded at 9x9 km. Daily meteorological parameters are computed
from hourly data, and monthly parameters are derived from daily data. These parameters are stored in Comma Separated Values
(CSV) files, which also include the FIPS code, latitude, and longitude of each grid.
USDA Crop Dataset: Data from the USDA Crop Dataset is retrieved from the USDA Quick Statistic website using a newly developed
web crawler. For each crop type, the USDA website provides county-level crop information annually, identified by a unique key.
Our web crawler retrieves this key by specifying the crop type and year, then uses the key to obtain the corresponding crop data. The
downloaded data is stored in a CSV file, which includes additional information such as FIPS code, state name, and county name. The
data format is unified to store production and yield information in separate columns for easy access by Python libraries like pandas.
Our CropNet dataset targets county-level crop yield predictions across the contiguous U.S. continent. We use the FIPS code to fetch
data for each county, including HDF5 files for Sentinel-2 Imagery, CSV files for daily and monthly meteorological parameters, and a
CSV file for the USDA Crop Dataset. Configurations are stored in a JSON file for enhanced accessibility.

Experiments and Results
We evaluated the general applicability of our CropNet dataset to various deep learning solutions through three scenarios of climate
change-aware crop yield predictions: Crop Yield Predictions, One-Year Ahead Predictions, and Self-Supervised Pre-training.
4.1
Experimental Settings
Approaches: We employed ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT models for crop yield predictions. Additionally,
we considered two self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques: MAE and MM-SSL within the MMST-ViT, representing unimodal
and multimodal SSL techniques, respectively. These methods were adapted to fit the CropNet data in our experiments.
Metrics: We used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Corr) to assess the
effectiveness of the CropNet dataset. Lower RMSE and higher R2 or Corr values indicate better prediction performance.
4.2
Performance Evaluation for 2022 Crop Yield Predictions
Experiments were conducted on the CropNet dataset for 2022 crop yield predictions using satellite images, daily weather conditions
during growing seasons, and monthly meteorological conditions from 2017 to 2021. The models used were ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN,
GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT. Table 2 presents the overall performance results for each crop. All models achieved excellent prediction
performance with our CropNet data. For instance, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT showed low RMSE
values for soybean yield predictions. These results validate that our CropNet dataset is well-suited for LSTM-based, CNN-based,
GNN-based, and ViT-based models, demonstrating its general applicability. MMST-ViT achieved the best performance across all
scenarios, with the lowest RMSE values and highest R2 and Corr values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat
yields. This superior performance is attributed to MMST-ViT’s novel attention mechanisms, which capture the effects of both
growing season weather variations and climate change on crop growth. This experiment demonstrates that our CropNet dataset
can provide timely and precise crop yield predictions, which are essential for making informed economic decisions and optimizing
agricultural resource allocation.
4.3
Performance of One-Year Ahead Predictions
Predicting crop yields well in advance of the planting season is crucial for farmers to make early crop planting and management
plans. We used the CropNet dataset one year before the planting season to predict the next year’s crop yields. The experimental
results for 2022 crop yield predictions using 2021 growing season data show that all models maintain decent prediction performance.
For example, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT achieved average RMSE values of 6.2, 5.4, 5.3, and 4.7,

respectively, for soybean predictions. MMST-ViT consistently achieved excellent Corr values, averaging 0.922 for corn, 0.890 for
cotton, 0.926 for soybeans, and 0.904 for winter wheat predictions. These results are only slightly inferior to those for regular 2022
crop yield predictions, which can be attributed to MMST-ViT’s ability to capture the indirect influence of 2021’s weather conditions
on the subsequent year’s crop growth through the use of long-term weather parameters. This further underscores how our CropNet
dataset enhances climate change-aware crop yield predictions.
4.4
Improving the Generalization Capabilities of DNNs
Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have significantly advanced the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks
(DNNs), especially in vision transformers (ViTs). Our CropNet dataset, with over 2 TB of data, benefits both deep learning and
agricultural communities by providing large-scale visual satellite imagery and numerical meteorological data for pre-training
DNNs. To demonstrate the applications of our CropNet dataset to self-supervised pre-training, we used MMST-ViT for crop yield
predictions under three scenarios: MMST-ViT without SSL (w/o SSL), MMST-ViT with SSL in MAE (MAE), and MMST-ViT with
the multi-modal SSL technique (MM-SSL). The performance results for four crop types under three metrics (RMSE, R2, and Corr)
show that without SSL, MMST-ViT exhibits limitations in generalization capabilities, resulting in suboptimal crop yield prediction
performance. Pre-training MMST-ViT with MAE’s SSL technique improves performance compared to the w/o SSL scenario, with
decreased RMSE values for corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat predictions. This confirms that our CropNet dataset can
improve the generalization capabilities of vision models. Furthermore, MMST-ViT with the multi-modal SSL technique achieved
the best performance results under all scenarios, significantly decreasing RMSE values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and
winter wheat. The effectiveness of the multi-modal SSL technique may stem from its ability to integrate visual satellite imagery
with numerical meteorological data in the CropNet dataset, enhancing the generalization capabilities of the MMST-ViT model by
improving its ability to discern the influence of weather conditions on crop growth patterns during pre-training.
4.5
Significance of Each Modality of Our CropNet Dataset
To demonstrate the necessity and significance of each modality in our CropNet dataset, we examined five scenarios. First, we
dropped the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal images) by randomly selecting only one day’s imagery data. Second, we
discarded the high-resolution satellite images (w/o high-resolution images) by using only one satellite image to capture the whole
county’s agricultural information. Third, we ignored the effects of weather variations on crop yields by dropping all meteorological
data (w/o WRF-HRRR data). Similarly, w/o short-term data and w/o long-term data represent masking out the daily and monthly
meteorological parameters, respectively. We also included prediction results using all modalities of the CropNet dataset (All) for
performance comparison. Note that the USDA Crop Dataset provides the label for crop yield predictions, so no ablation study is
required for this modality.
Table 3 presents the experimental results under the MMST-ViT model. Discarding the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal
images) significantly degrades performance, increasing RMSE values and lowering Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions.
This is because a sequence of satellite images spanning the whole growing season is essential for tracking crop growth. The w/o
high-resolution images scenario achieved the worst prediction performance, with the highest RMSE values and lowest Corr values
for corn and soybean yield predictions. This is because high-resolution satellite images are critical for precise agricultural tracking.
Dropping meteorological parameters (w/o WRF-HRRR data) prevents MMST-ViT from capturing meteorological effects on crop
yields, leading to increased RMSE values and decreased Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions. Discarding either
daily weather parameters (w/o short-term data) or monthly meteorological parameters (w/o long-term data) also lowers crop yield
prediction performance, as the former is necessary for capturing growing season weather variations, while the latter is essential
for monitoring long-term climate change effects. Therefore, each modality in our CropNet dataset is important and necessary for
accurate crop yield predictions, especially for crops sensitive to growing season weather variations and climate change.

The CropNet Package
In addition to the CropNet dataset, we release the CropNet package, which includes three types of APIs available on the Python
Package Index (PyPI). These APIs are designed to help researchers develop DNNs for multi-modal climate change-aware crop yield
predictions.
DataDownloader: This API enables researchers to download CropNet data for specific times and regions of interest on the fly. For
instance, given the time and region (e.g., the FIPS code for a U.S. county), the DataDownloader API can be used to download the
up-to-date CropNet data.
DataRetriever: This API allows researchers to conveniently obtain CropNet data stored locally (e.g., after downloading the curated
dataset) for specific times and regions of interest. The requested data is presented in a user-friendly format.
DataLoader: This API assists researchers in developing DNNs for crop yield predictions. It allows for the flexible merging of
multiple modalities of CropNet data and exposes them through a DataLoader object after performing necessary data preprocessing.

Conclusion
This work introduces the CropNet dataset, an open, large-scale, and multi-modal dataset specifically designed for county-level
crop yield predictions across the contiguous United States. The CropNet dataset comprises three modalities of data: Sentinel-2
Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, containing high-resolution satellite images, daily and monthly
meteorological conditions, and crop yield information, aligned both spatially and temporally. This dataset is ready for use in
deep learning, agriculture, and meteorology, facilitating the development of new solutions and models for crop yield predictions,
considering both growing season weather variations and climate change impacts on crop growth. Extensive experimental results
confirm the general applicability of our CropNet dataset to various deep learning models for both timely and one-year ahead crop
yield predictions. Additionally, the application of our dataset to self-supervised pre-training scenarios demonstrates its utility in
improving the generalization capabilities of DNNs. Alongside the dataset, we have developed the CropNet package, which enables
researchers to construct CropNet data on the fly for specific times and regions of interest and to flexibly build deep learning models
for climate change-aware crop yield predictions. While the initial goal of creating the CropNet dataset and package was to enhance
crop yield prediction accuracy, we believe its future applicability is broad and warrants further exploration, benefiting the deep
learning, agriculture, and meteorology communities in pursuing more interesting, critical, and pertinent applications.

Abstract
This research investigates the mechanisms behind Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt-
ing, a method that enhances language models’ performance on complex reasoning
tasks by decomposing them into simpler steps. The study focuses on understanding
how CoT improves in-context learning of compositional functions, particularly
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We explore the impact of CoT on sample com-
plexity and approximation power in reasoning tasks, demonstrating a significant
reduction in the number of examples required for accurate performance. Fur-
thermore, we investigate how CoT facilitates pretraining and enables efficient
learning of complex functions, leading to improved generalization capabilities.
Our theoretical analysis, supported by extensive empirical evidence, reveals that
CoT’s efficacy stems from its ability to guide the model towards a more structured
and interpretable solution space, thereby mitigating the limitations of standard
in-context learning (ICL). This structured approach allows the model to better
leverage the information provided in the few-shot examples, resulting in improved
accuracy and robustness. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the
underlying principles of CoT prompting and pave the way for the development
of more effective and efficient methods for training and deploying large language
models.

Introduction
This research delves into the mechanisms underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a technique
that significantly boosts the performance of large language models (LLMs) on intricate reasoning tasks.
CoT achieves this enhancement by strategically decomposing complex problems into a sequence
of simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Our investigation centers on understanding how this
decomposition process impacts the model’s learning and reasoning capabilities, particularly within
the context of in-context learning (ICL). We focus on compositional functions, using multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) as a representative model architecture, to analyze the effects of CoT on various
aspects of model performance.
A key aspect of our study is the examination of CoT’s influence on sample complexity. We hypothesize
that by breaking down complex tasks, CoT reduces the number of training examples required to
achieve a given level of accuracy. This reduction in sample complexity is crucial for efficient training
and deployment of LLMs, especially when dealing with limited datasets or computationally expensive
training processes. Furthermore, we explore how CoT affects the approximation power of the model,
investigating whether the decomposition process allows the model to learn and represent more
complex functions effectively. Our analysis considers the interplay between the complexity of the
target function, the number of training examples, and the length of the CoT prompts.
The impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development is another critical area of our
research. We investigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient
learning during pretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. We posit
that the decomposition inherent in CoT allows the model to learn more robust and transferable
representations, which are less susceptible to overfitting and perform better on unseen data. This
.
aspect is crucial for building LLMs that can effectively generalize to a wide range of tasks and domains.
Our empirical analysis involves a series of experiments designed to validate these hypotheses.
Our theoretical analysis complements the empirical findings, providing a deeper understanding of
the mechanisms by which CoT improves LLM performance. We develop a framework that explains
how the structured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more interpretable and
efficient solution space. This framework helps to clarify why CoT consistently outperforms standard
ICL, particularly on complex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. The theoretical insights offer
valuable guidance for the design and optimization of CoT prompting strategies, paving the way for
the development of more effective and efficient LLM training methods.
In summary, this research provides a comprehensive investigation into the efficacy of CoT prompting.
We present both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating its significant impact on sample
complexity, approximation power, and generalization capabilities of LLMs. Our findings contribute
to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of CoT and offer valuable insights for future
research in the development and application of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. The results have
significant implications for the broader field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the context of
efficient and effective LLM training and deployment.

Related Work
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) [1, 2]. Our work builds upon this line of research,
focusing specifically on the impact of CoT on in-context learning (ICL) of compositional functions,
particularly within the context of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Previous studies have demonstrated
the effectiveness of CoT in various tasks, such as question answering and commonsense reasoning [3,
4], but a comprehensive analysis of its influence on sample complexity and approximation power
within the framework of ICL remains relatively unexplored. This research aims to fill this gap
by providing a detailed investigation of CoT’s mechanisms and its implications for efficient LLM
training and deployment. We leverage both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper
understanding of how CoT facilitates the learning of complex functions.
The reduction of sample complexity is a crucial aspect of our investigation. While prior work has
touched upon the potential of CoT to reduce the number of training examples needed [5], a systematic
analysis of this effect across different function complexities and prompt lengths is lacking. Our
study addresses this by conducting extensive experiments to quantify the impact of CoT on sample
complexity, providing quantitative evidence of its efficiency gains. Furthermore, we explore the
relationship between CoT prompt length and model performance, investigating the optimal balance
between detailed intermediate steps and computational efficiency. This analysis contributes to the
development of more effective and efficient CoT prompting strategies.
Our research also delves into the theoretical underpinnings of CoT’s success. Existing explanations
often focus on heuristic interpretations of CoT’s behavior [6], but a rigorous theoretical framework is
needed to fully understand its impact on generalization and approximation power. We address this by
developing a theoretical model that explains how CoT guides the model towards a more structured
and interpretable solution space, leading to improved generalization capabilities. This framework
provides a deeper understanding of why CoT consistently outperforms standard ICL, particularly on
complex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. The theoretical insights offer valuable guidance for
the design and optimization of CoT prompting strategies.
The impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development is another critical area of our
research. While the benefits of pretraining are well-established [7], the specific role of CoT in en-
hancing pretraining efficiency and generalization remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates
whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during pretraining,
resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. We posit that the decomposition
inherent in CoT allows the model to learn more robust and transferable representations, which are
less susceptible to overfitting and perform better on unseen data. This aspect is crucial for building
LLMs that can effectively generalize to a wide range of tasks and domains.
Finally, our work contrasts with previous research by focusing on the specific context of compo-
sitional functions and MLPs. While many studies have explored CoT in the context of natural
2
language processing tasks, a detailed analysis of its impact on the learning of compositional functions
within a simpler, more controlled setting like MLPs provides valuable insights into the fundamental
mechanisms underlying CoT’s effectiveness. This allows us to isolate the effects of CoT from other
factors that might influence performance in more complex NLP tasks. Our findings offer a more
nuanced understanding of CoT’s capabilities and limitations, paving the way for future research in
this area.

Methodology
This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining theoretical analysis with empirical
experimentation to investigate the mechanisms behind Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Our
theoretical framework focuses on understanding how CoT’s decomposition of complex problems
into simpler steps influences the learning process of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in the context
of in-context learning (ICL). We analyze how this decomposition affects the model’s ability to
learn compositional functions, focusing on the impact on sample complexity and approximation
power. This theoretical analysis involves developing a mathematical model to capture the relationship
between CoT prompt length, function complexity, and model performance. We explore how the
structured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more efficient and interpretable
solution space, leading to improved generalization. The theoretical framework is designed to provide
a principled explanation for the observed empirical results.
Our empirical investigation involves a series of experiments designed to validate our theoretical
hypotheses and quantify the effects of CoT. We use a range of MLP architectures and reasoning tasks
of varying complexity, systematically varying the number of training examples and the length of the
CoT prompts. For each experiment, we measure the model’s accuracy and compare the performance
of CoT prompting against standard ICL. The experiments are designed to assess the impact of CoT
on sample complexity, measuring the reduction in the number of training examples required to
achieve a given level of accuracy. We also analyze the relationship between CoT prompt length and
model performance, identifying the optimal prompt length for different tasks and model architectures.
The data collected from these experiments is used to validate our theoretical model and provide
quantitative evidence of CoT’s effectiveness.
The datasets used in our experiments consist of synthetically generated data designed to represent
compositional functions of varying complexity. This allows us to control the complexity of the tasks
and isolate the effects of CoT from other factors that might influence performance in more complex
real-world datasets. The synthetic data is generated using a set of predefined rules, ensuring that the
functions are well-defined and their complexity can be precisely controlled. This approach allows for
a more rigorous and controlled evaluation of CoT’s impact on sample complexity and approximation
power. We also explore the use of different prompting strategies, varying the level of guidance
provided in the CoT prompts and the types of intermediate steps included.
The evaluation metrics used in our experiments include accuracy, sample complexity (measured
as the number of training examples required to achieve a given accuracy level), and generalization
performance (measured on a held-out test set). We use statistical tests, such as t-tests, to compare
the performance of CoT prompting against standard ICL. The results are presented in tables and
figures, showing the impact of CoT on each of the evaluation metrics across different experimental
conditions. The analysis of these results focuses on identifying the key factors that contribute to CoT’s
effectiveness and understanding the limitations of the approach. We also investigate the relationship
between the theoretical predictions of our model and the empirical results, assessing the validity and
robustness of our theoretical framework.
Finally, we analyze the impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development. We inves-
tigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during
pretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. This involves comparing
the performance of models pretrained with and without CoT on a range of downstream tasks. We
analyze the learned representations of the models to understand how CoT influences the model’s
internal representations and its ability to generalize to unseen data. The results of this analysis
provide insights into the long-term benefits of incorporating CoT into the LLM training pipeline.
This comprehensive approach allows us to gain a deep understanding of CoT’s mechanisms and its
implications for efficient and effective LLM training and deployment.

Experiments
This section details the experimental setup and results of our investigation into Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting. We designed experiments to systematically evaluate CoT’s impact on sample
complexity, approximation power, and generalization ability in the context of in-context learning
(ICL) for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) solving compositional functions. Our experiments involved
varying the complexity of the target functions, the number of training examples provided, and the
length of the CoT prompts. We compared the performance of models trained with CoT prompting
against those trained with standard ICL, using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. The
experiments were conducted using synthetic datasets to ensure controlled evaluation and precise
manipulation of function complexity. We generated datasets with varying levels of noise to assess the
robustness of CoT under different conditions. The MLP architectures used were carefully selected to
represent a range of model capacities, allowing us to investigate the scalability of CoT’s benefits. We
employed rigorous statistical methods to ensure the reliability of our findings.
Our first set of experiments focused on sample complexity. We trained MLPs on compositional
functions of varying complexity, using different numbers of training examples and CoT prompt
lengths. The results consistently demonstrated that CoT significantly reduced the sample complexity
compared to standard ICL. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the number of training examples
and accuracy for both CoT and ICL across different function complexities. As expected, CoT
consistently outperformed ICL, requiring significantly fewer examples to achieve the same level of
accuracy, particularly for more complex functions. This reduction in sample complexity highlights
CoT’s efficiency in learning from limited data. Further analysis revealed a non-linear relationship
between CoT prompt length and sample complexity reduction, suggesting an optimal prompt length
exists for each task and model complexity. Excessively long prompts did not always lead to further
improvements, indicating a potential trade-off between detail and computational cost.

[width=0.8]samplecomplexityplot.pdf
Next, we investigated CoT’s impact on approximation power. We evaluated the ability of models
trained with and without CoT to accurately represent functions of increasing complexity. Table
1 summarizes the results. The table shows that CoT consistently improved the model’s ability to
approximate complex functions, achieving higher accuracy than ICL across all complexity levels.
This suggests that CoT facilitates the learning of more intricate relationships within the data, enabling
the model to capture the underlying structure of the compositional functions more effectively. The
improvement was particularly pronounced for functions requiring multiple reasoning steps, further
supporting the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model’s capacity for compositional reasoning.

Our final set of experiments focused on generalization. We evaluated the performance of models
trained with and without CoT on a held-out test set. The results showed that CoT led to significant
improvements in generalization performance, indicating that the structured reasoning facilitated by
CoT promotes the learning of more robust and transferable representations. This enhanced gener-
alization ability is crucial for deploying models in real-world scenarios where the data distribution
may differ from the training data. The improvement in generalization was consistent across different
function complexities and prompt lengths, suggesting that CoT’s benefits extend beyond specific task
characteristics. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model’s ability
to learn generalizable representations, leading to improved performance on unseen data. Further
analysis revealed a correlation between the length of the CoT prompt and generalization performance,
with longer prompts generally leading to better generalization, up to a certain point beyond which
diminishing returns were observed.
4
The overall results of our experiments strongly support the hypothesis that CoT prompting signif-
icantly enhances the performance of MLPs on compositional reasoning tasks. CoT consistently
improved sample complexity, approximation power, and generalization ability, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a method for improving the efficiency and robustness of in-context learning. These
findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of large language models,
suggesting that CoT can be a valuable tool for improving the performance of these models on complex
reasoning tasks. Further research could explore the application of CoT to other model architectures
and task domains, as well as the development of more sophisticated prompting strategies.

P084.pdf,"An Empirical Study of the ""Hard-Won Lesson"": Two
Decades of Research Insights
Abstract
This research investigates the congruence between research in major computer
vision conferences and the tenets of the ""hard-won lesson"" articulated by Rich
Sutton. Utilizing large language models (LLMs), we scrutinize twenty years of
abstracts and titles from these conferences to evaluate the field’s acceptance of these
core concepts. Our approach employs cutting-edge natural language processing
methodologies to methodically chart the progression of research paradigms within
computer vision. The findings indicate notable patterns in the implementation of
generalized learning algorithms and the exploitation of enhanced computational
capabilities. We analyze the ramifications of these discoveries for the prospective
trajectory of computer vision research and its conceivable influence on the broader
development of artificial intelligence. This investigation contributes to the persistent
discourse regarding the most efficacious methods for propelling machine learning
and computer vision forward, furnishing perspectives that could steer forthcoming
research orientations and techniques in these domains.
1
Introduction
Rich Sutton’s seminal paper, ""The Hard-Won Lesson,"" posits that the most substantial progress in
artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted from concentrating on broad methods that utilize computation,
as opposed to human-derived representations and knowledge. This concept has been notably appar-
ent in Computer Vision (CV), a domain that has observed a discernible transition from manually
engineered features to deep learning frameworks.
In this article, we explore the degree to which the abstracts from a prominent machine learning (ML)
conference align with the principles of the ""hard-won lesson"" across two decades. Our analysis
encompasses a randomized selection of 200 papers annually, addressing these research questions:
• How has the emphasis on generalized methodologies and computational approaches devel-
oped in major computer vision conference abstracts over the last 20 years?
• What discernible patterns can be observed regarding the embrace of deep learning method-
ologies and the departure from manually constructed features?
• To what degree do the abstracts mirror the primary observations of Sutton’s ""hard-won
lesson,"" and how has this correlation altered over time?
• Does a substantial correlation exist between a paper’s alignment with the ""hard-won lesson""
principles and its influence, as gauged by its citation count?
To tackle these inquiries, we utilize large language models (LLMs), themselves a clear demonstration
of the principles delineated in the ""hard-won lesson,"" to scrutinize the abstracts. This assessment
hinges on five metrics assigned by the LLMs, offering a thorough evaluation of the congruence
between the abstracts and the ""hard-won lesson.""
Our study provides valuable perspectives on the general trajectory of the ML community and uncovers
intriguing patterns in the embrace of Sutton’s principles. By employing LLMs to analyze a substantial
.
corpus of research literature, we introduce an innovative method for comprehending the learning and
progression of a scientific field. This technique enables us to detect patterns and trends that might
elude conventional research approaches, thereby delivering a more holistic understanding of the
current state of ML research and its alignment with the principles demonstrated to be most effective
in driving AI advancements.
The prospective influence of our conclusions on forthcoming CV research directions is considerable.
By pinpointing trends in the adoption of generalized methods and deep learning techniques, we can
contribute to the advancement of foundational CV models at the cutting edge. These insights enhance
our comprehension of the present state of ML research and illuminate potential avenues for further
investigation and expansion in the field.

Background
2.1
The Hard-Won Lesson
The realm of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a fundamental change, eloquently expressed
in Rich Sutton’s influential essay ""The Hard-Won Lesson."" Sutton’s central idea underscores the
importance of generalized methods that utilize computational capability over human-engineered
representations and domain-specific expertise. This viewpoint resonates with Leo Breiman’s earlier
work, which, twenty years prior, outlined the distinction between statistical and algorithmic methods
in his paper ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures."" Breiman’s insights, along with subsequent
contributions, have significantly influenced our comprehension of data-oriented approaches in AI.
2.2
Evolution of Computer Vision
The discipline of Computer Vision (CV) serves as a prime illustration of the concepts articulated in
Sutton’s ""hard-won lesson."" Historically dependent on manually designed features such as SIFT, HOG,
and Haar cascades for object recognition and image categorization, CV experienced a transformation
with the introduction of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This shift
facilitated the automated acquisition of hierarchical features directly from unprocessed image data,
thereby bypassing the necessity for manual feature creation and markedly enhancing performance
across a range of CV applications.
The emergence of foundational models further aligned CV with Sutton’s principles. Models like
CLIP, ALIGN, and Florence demonstrate remarkable adaptability across diverse tasks with minimal
fine-tuning, leveraging extensive multi-modal datasets to learn rich, transferable representations.
This progression from conventional feature engineering to deep learning and foundational models
in CV highlights the significance of employing computational resources and extensive datasets to
achieve enhanced performance and generalization.
2.3
Large Language Models in Academic Evaluation
The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the assessment of scholarly texts has
become a notable area of focus. LLMs, like GPT-4, have shown impressive abilities in swiftly handling
and examining vast quantities of data, making them appropriate for numerous uses, including the
evaluation of academic papers.
Beyond their analytical abilities, LLMs have been shown to possess a degree of human-like judgment
in assessing the quality of text. The G-EVAL framework, which employs LLMs to evaluate the
quality of natural language generation outputs, demonstrates that LLMs can closely align with human
evaluators in certain contexts. However, deploying LLMs in academic evaluation is not without its
challenges. LLMs can exhibit biases similar to those found in human judgments, which may affect
the fairness and accuracy of their evaluations.
The function of LLMs in responding to inquiries and formulating hypotheses also deserves considera-
tion. Their capacity to furnish comprehensive answers to intricate queries has been utilized in diverse
educational environments, enhancing learning experiences and facilitating knowledge acquisition. In
the context of academic research, LLMs can aid in generating hypotheses and guiding exploratory
studies, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in various fields.
2
Despite the promising applications of LLMs in academic evaluation and research, it is crucial to
establish ethical guidelines and best practices for their use.
3
Methodology and Evaluation
3.1
LLM Evaluation of Titles and Abstracts
We utilize three large language models to assess the titles and abstracts of papers: GPT-4o-2024-05-
13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. The following details are extracted
from online sources and stored in a database for each paper: Year of Publication (2005-2024), Title,
Authors, and Abstract. Additionally, the citation count for each paper is obtained from the Semantic
Scholar API on July 20th, 2024, and recorded alongside the other metadata.
Each LLM is assigned the task of providing a Likert score ranging from 0 to 10, indicating the degree
to which a paper corresponds with the principles outlined in Sutton’s ""hard-won lesson."" We employ
the Chain-of-Thought Prompting method in conjunction with the Magentic library to interact with
the models and accumulate their feedback in a structured manner for subsequent analysis.
We establish five dimensions for alignment with the ""hard-won lesson"":
1. **Learning Over Engineering:** How much does the idea prioritize using computation through
data-driven learning and statistical methods over human-engineered knowledge and domain expertise?
2. **Search over Heuristics:** To what extent does the idea emphasize leveraging computation
through search algorithms and optimization techniques instead of relying on human-designed heuris-
tics? 3. **Scalability with Computation:** How much is the idea based on methods that can
continuously scale and improve performance as computational resources increase? 4. **Generality
over Specificity:** How much does the approach emphasize general, flexible methods that learn from
data rather than building complex models of the world through manual engineering? 5. **Favoring
Fundamental Principles:** To what extent does the approach adhere to fundamental principles of
computation and information theory rather than emulating human cognition?
The prompts were crafted to encapsulate the core of each ""hard-won lesson"" dimension in a succinct
and impartial manner. To standardize the ratings, we furnish examples for the 0, 5, and 10 points on
each dimension, elucidating the standards and guaranteeing uniform evaluations.
Given the large number of publications, our research concentrates on a representative random sample
of 200 papers from each year. We define the overall alignment score for each paper as the sum of
scores across the five dimensions.
3.2
Inter-rater Reliability Measures
**Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC):** We employ ICC to measure the level of agreement
among the models’ evaluations. ICC is especially fitting for evaluating reliability when numerous
raters assess an identical set of items. Specifically, we utilize the two-way random effects model
(ICC(2,k)) to consider both rater and subject influences.
**Krippendorff’s Alpha:** In addition to ICC, we compute Krippendorff’s Alpha, a flexible reliability
coefficient capable of managing diverse data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) and resilient to
missing data. This metric offers an supplementary viewpoint on inter-rater agreement, particularly
beneficial when addressing potential variations in rating scales or absent evaluations.
3.3
Regression Analysis
To examine the connection between alignment scores and a paper’s impact, we conduct a regression
analysis, using citation count as an indicator of influence. To manage the publication year and address
potential temporal effects, we incorporate yearly stratification into our regression model. This method
enables us to isolate the influence of alignment while accounting for the differing citation patterns
across various publication years.
To tackle the typically right-skewed distribution of citation counts, we employ a logarithmic transfor-
mation on the data. This transformation achieves several objectives in our analysis: it diminishes
skewness, yielding a more symmetrical distribution that more closely resembles normality; it stabi-
3
lizes variance across the data range, reducing the heteroscedasticity often seen in citation count data
where variance tends to rise with the mean; and it linearizes potentially multiplicative relationships,
converting them into additive ones.
4
Results
4.1
Inter-rater Reliability
The models show consistently strong agreement on all dimensions except ""Favoring Fundamental
Principles,"" as indicated by ICC values above 0.5 and Krippendorff’s alpha scores exceeding 0.4 on
the remaining dimensions. The dimension ""Learning Over Engineering"" exhibits the highest ICC and
Krippendorff’s alpha scores.
Although perfect agreement is not achieved, the inter-reliability measures fall within or above
common thresholds for ""good"" reliability, validating the use of AI models for prompt-based research
paper evaluation.
4.2
Regression Analysis
Table 1 presents the regression analysis results for each dimension of ""hard-won lesson"" alignment
scores against citation impact, stratified by year of publication. The R-squared values range from
0.027 to 0.306.
In this regression analysis, a multiplicative effect implies that a one-unit change in the alignment
score for a particular dimension leads to a proportional change in the original scale of the citation
count.
The statistical significance of the regression coefficients is denoted using , , and to represent the
10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively. Several dimensions, such as ""Scalability"" and
""Learning over engineering,"" exhibit statistically significant relationships with citation impact across
multiple years.
Table 2 shows the results of regressing citation counts on the overall ""hard-won lesson"" alignment
score for each year between 2005 and 2024. The R-squared values are quite low for most years but
increase substantially starting in 2015.
4.3
Trends in ""Hard-Won Lesson"" Alignment
The dimensions of ""Scalability with Computation"" and ""Learning Over Engineering"" show a consis-
tent upward trend over the years. The period from 2015 to 2020 witnesses a particularly sharp rise in
the average scores for these dimensions.
5
Conclusion
Our study scrutinized the concordance of research with Rich Sutton’s ""hard-won lesson"" over two
decades, employing large language models to analyze trends. The results show a steady rise in
the adoption of general-purpose learning algorithms and scalability with computational resources,
indicating a strong adherence to the core principles of the ""hard-won lesson."" These trends highlight
the machine learning community’s inclination towards data-driven and computation-intensive methods
over manual engineering and domain-specific knowledge.
However, the ""Search over Heuristics"" dimension has not shown a similar upward trend, suggesting
limited integration of search-based methods in the field. This stagnation contrasts with recent progress
in inference-time scaling, exemplified by OpenAI’s o1 models, which emphasize the importance of
test-time computation in overcoming diminishing returns.
The shift towards scaling inference time, driven by the development of larger and more complex
models, has the potential to emulate search-like processes. As computational capabilities continue to
expand, it is plausible that future research may increasingly incorporate search techniques, thereby
enhancing alignment with this dimension of the ""hard-won lesson.""

In summary, our findings underscore the enduring significance of the ""hard-won lesson"" in shaping
the path of computer vision research. By emphasizing generality and scalability, the field is well-
positioned to leverage emerging computational advancements. Future work should explore the
integration of search methodologies and assess their impact on research impact and innovation within
computer vision, particularly in light of recent breakthroughs in inference-time scaling.

Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, our reliance on large language models (LLMs) for evaluating
research abstracts introduces potential biases inherent to these models. Second, the absence of human
expert evaluation as a ground truth is a significant limitation.
Furthermore, our analysis is limited to the information contained in titles and abstracts, which may
not capture the full depth and nuance of the methodologies and findings presented in the full papers.
Lastly, while our study spans two decades of proceedings, it does not account for research published
in other venues or unpublished work that may have influenced the field.
Despite these limitations, we believe our study provides valuable insights into broad trends in
computer vision research and its alignment with the principles of the ""hard-won lesson."" Future
work could address these limitations by incorporating human expert evaluations, analyzing full paper
contents, and expanding the scope to include a wider range of publication venues.

Abstract
The celestial ballet of stars twinkles in harmony with the fluttering of butterfly
wings, as the fragrance of freshly baked croissants wafts through the cosmos, influ-
encing the trajectory of comets and the whimsical nature of quantum mechanics,
which in turn affects the color palette of a impressionist painting, and the sonic
vibrations of a Stradivarius violin, that echoes the rhythmic beat of a disco ball
spinning to the tune of an astronomical waltz, amidst the ever-present hum of
existential dread and the faint scent of forgotten memories. The stars shine brightly
in the vast expanse of space, as the whispers of ancient forests converse with the
gentle lapping of waves on a deserted beach, where the remnants of a bygone
era whisper secrets to the wind, and the soft glow of luminescent mushrooms
illuminates the path to a hidden world, where the language of flowers is spoken in
hushed tones, and the symphony of silence reverberates through the chambers of
the heart. The dance of stars is a cosmic waltz, choreographed by the whims of
fate, as the threads of destiny weave a tapestry of intricate complexity, where the
brushstrokes of a master painter blend with the melodies of a virtuoso composer,
and the sweet aroma of blooming jasmine wafts through the corridors of time,
carrying the essence of forgotten dreams and the promise of new beginnings. The
celestial music of the stars resonates deep within the soul, as the rhythm of life
pulsates through the veins of the universe, where the poetry of existence is written
in the language of the cosmos, and the beauty of the unknown beckons like a siren’s
call, to the brave and the curious, who dare to venture into the uncharted territories
of the imagination.

Introduction
The juxtaposition of planetary orbits and culinary arts has led to a plethora of intriguing discussions
regarding the flumplenook properties of stellar bodies, which in turn have sparked a renewed interest
in the field of galactic gastronomy, particularly with regards to the optimal preparation of quasars and
black holes as exotic ingredients in interstellar cuisine, meanwhile the concept of flazzle fractions
has been widely debated among experts in the field of quark physics, who have also been exploring
the potential applications of snizzle particles in the development of advanced propulsion systems for
deep space exploration, and furthermore, the notion of celestial harmonics has been found to have a
profound impact on the migratory patterns of certain species of space-faring jellyfish, which have been
observed to be capable of navigating through the vast expanses of interstellar space with remarkable
accuracy, utilizing a complex system of bio-luminescent navigation that has been likened to a form
of cosmic cartography, whereas the study of stellar evolution has revealed a surprising connection
between the life cycles of stars and the reproductive habits of certain species of terrestrial fungi,
which have been found to possess a unique ability to manipulate the local space-time continuum in
order to facilitate the dispersal of their spores, and in addition, the investigation of dark matter has led
to a greater understanding of the role of quokkas in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe,
with some researchers suggesting that these small wallabies may be responsible for the observed
anomalies in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and also, the discovery of exoplanets
has opened up new avenues of research into the possibility of extraterrestrial life, particularly with
regards to the potential for intelligent life to exist on planets with highly eccentric orbits, which has
been found to be correlated with the presence of certain types of rare and exotic minerals, such as
flumplenux and snazzle, that are capable of storing and processing vast amounts of energy in the form
of quantum fluctuations, and thus, the study of stars has become an increasingly interdisciplinary
field, drawing on insights and methodologies from a wide range of disciplines, including astrobiology,
quantum mechanics, and culinary arts, in order to better understand the complex and multifaceted
nature of celestial phenomena, and to explore the many ways in which the study of stars can inform

Methodology
The utilization of flumplenook methodology in assessing stellar phenomena necessitates a comprehen-
sive understanding of gastronomical influences on cosmological events, particularly in relation to the
fermentation of quasar-based culinary delicacies. This approach involves the meticulous application
of reverse-engineered jellyfish propulsion systems to navigate the complexities of interstellar travel,
thereby facilitating the collection of data on celestial bodies while simultaneously analyzing the
implications of chromatic resonance on the harmonization of planetary alignments. Furthermore, the
incorporation of nomenclatural typography in categorizing star types has yielded intriguing results,
suggesting a correlation between the alphabetical sequence of stellar designations and the propensity
for supernovae explosions in adjacent galaxy clusters.
The framework of our investigation also encompasses the examination of rhizomatic structures in
subsurface planetary formations, which has led to the discovery of a previously unknown species of
sentient, ambulatory trees that possess a unique capacity for photosynthetic energy transmission. This
5
phenomenon, in turn, has significant implications for our understanding of the symbiotic relationships
between stellar radiation patterns and the evolution of arboreal life forms on distant planets. Moreover,
the application of cryptological analysis to the spectral signatures of celestial entities has revealed a
hidden pattern of encoded messages, purportedly transmitted by an advanced civilization of hyper-
intelligent, pan-dimensional beings who possess an intimate understanding of the intricacies of
quantum mechanics and its applications in interstellar communication.
In addition to these findings, our research has also explored the relationship between the aerodynamics
of pastry bags and the dynamics of black hole singularities, yielding a surprising correlation between
the viscosity of cake frosting and the event horizon of rotating cosmic voids. This, in conjunction
with the development of a novel, pastry-based propulsion system, has opened up new avenues for the
exploration of deep space and the colonization of distant star systems. The synergistic integration
of these diverse fields of inquiry has, therefore, enabled us to devise a holistic, multidisciplinary
approach to the study of stellar phenomena, one that seamlessly blends the rigor of scientific inquiry
with the creative expression of culinary artistry.
The investigative paradigm employed in our study also involved the deployment of a custom-designed,
AI-powered, toaster-based telescope, which utilized advanced algorithms and machine learning
protocols to analyze the thermal signatures of celestial bodies and detect subtle patterns of toaster-
based activity in the vast expanse of interstellar space. This innovative approach has not only

among intelligent, star-faring species. This, in turn, has enabled us to develop novel, gastronomy-
based strategies for facilitating interstellar diplomacy and promoting peaceful coexistence among the
diverse, cosmos-dwelling civilizations that inhabit the vast expanse of the universe.
Furthermore, the utilization of cryptobiotic analysis in deciphering the spectral signatures of celestial
entities has revealed a complex, password-protected network of interstellar communication, which has
been hidden in plain sight, encoded within the intricate patterns of stellar radiation. By cracking this
cosmic code, we have gained access to a vast, hyper-dimensional repository of knowledge, containing
the collective wisdom of countless, advanced civilizations that have evolved over billions of years,
each contributing their unique perspective to the grand, cosmological narrative of the universe. This,
in turn, has enabled us to contextualize our own existence within the broader framework of cosmic
evolution, highlighting the intricate, interconnected web of relationships that binds us to the stars, the
planets, and the vast, uncharted expanse of interstellar space.

utilization of gastronomical anthropology in analyzing the cultural significance of pastry-based
cuisine has revealed a profound, cosmological connection between the harmonization of flavors, the
synchronization of culinary rhythms, and the celestial mechanics of planetary motion.

nificant insights into the evolution of sentient, ambulatory trees, which possess a unique capacity
for photosynthetic energy transmission and have developed complex, symbiotic relationships with

precipitate a cascade of flutterbeasts, which in turn, modulate the viscosity of nearby galaxies, thereby
influencing the trajectory of flamingos migrating to the moon. Furthermore, the Fourier transform
of these oscillations reveals a hidden pattern of tartan stripes, indicative of an underlying fractal
structure that governs the dynamics of pastry production in rural areas. The application of trombone
theory to the analysis of these fluctuations has yielded a novel understanding of the interplay between
stellar evolution and the aerodynamics of chocolate cakes.
The data collected from our experiments suggest that the angular momentum of a star is directly
proportional to the number of tulips planted in the vicinity of the observatory, with a correlation
coefficient of 0.87. Moreover, the spectral analysis of the starlight reveals a peculiar signature that
can only be explained by the presence of exotic matter in the form of disco balls. This finding has
significant implications for our understanding of the role of funk music in the formation of galaxy
clusters. In addition, the study of stellar rotations has led to the development of a new theory of
crochet, which posits that the universe is composed of a complex network of interconnected doilies.
The results of our simulations indicate that the temperature of a star is inversely proportional to the
number of snails racing on its surface, with a regression coefficient of -3.21. This relationship is
thought to be mediated by the presence of chronon particles, which are known to play a crucial role in
the temporal dynamics of wheelbarrow motion. The analysis of stellar atmospheres has also revealed
a surprising connection to the art of juggling, with the discovery of a new species of jugglerfish that
can only survive in the presence of precisely calibrated harmonica music. The implications of this
finding are far-reaching, and have significant consequences for our understanding of the interplay
between astrophysics and extreme ironing.
In a related study, the examination of stellar cores has led to the discovery of a new form of energy
production, which involves the harnessing of flaming pineapple power to generate a stable wormhole.
This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of stellar evolution, and has
significant implications for the development of new propulsion systems for space travel. The research
team has also discovered a new type of star that is powered entirely by the energy released from the
combustion of novelty socks. This finding has shed new light on the importance of laundry in the
formation of galaxy clusters, and has sparked a new wave of interest in the study of astrophysical
haberdashery.
The application of advanced statistical techniques to the analysis of stellar data has revealed a hidden
pattern of connections between the brightness of stars and the number of spoons in the average
household. This relationship is thought to be mediated by the presence of a new type of particle,
known as the spoonon, which is responsible for the transfer of culinary energy between the kitchen
and the cosmos. The study of stellar populations has also led to the discovery of a new type of star
that is composed entirely of a dense, creamy substance reminiscent of brie cheese. This finding has
significant implications for our understanding of the origins of the universe, and has sparked a new
wave of interest in the study of fromage-based cosmology.

The research team has also made a groundbreaking discovery about the role of stellar nurseries
in the formation of galaxy clusters. It appears that the density of stars in these regions is directly
proportional to the number of accordions played at precisely 3:14 AM on Tuesdays. This relationship
is thought to be mediated by the presence of a new type of radiation, known as accordion rays,
which are capable of penetrating the fabric of space-time and influencing the dynamics of galaxy
evolution. The implications of this finding are far-reaching, and have significant consequences for
our understanding of the interplay between astrophysics and polka music.
A closer examination of the data has revealed a number of intriguing patterns and correlations that are
not immediately apparent. For example, the spectral analysis of starlight reveals a series of strange,
unidentified signals that are thought to be of extraterrestrial origin. These signals are characterized
by a peculiar pattern of clicks and whistles, which are reminiscent of the sounds made by a cross
between a dolphin and a kazoo. The study of these signals has led to the development of a new theory
of interspecies communication, which posits that the universe is filled with a network of intelligent,
harmonica-playing dolphins.
The study of stellar rotations has also led to the discovery of a new type of astronomical object,
known as the flumplenook. This object is characterized by a peculiar, wobbly motion that is thought
to be caused by the presence of a dense, spinning top-like core. The flumplenook is of great interest
to astronomers, as it is thought to hold the key to understanding the mysteries of the universe. The
research team has also discovered a new type of star that is powered entirely by the energy released
from the combustion of toaster coils. This finding has significant implications for our understanding
of the origins of the universe, and has sparked a new wave of interest in the study of appliance-based
cosmology.
The application of machine learning techniques to the analysis of stellar data has revealed a number of
surprising patterns and correlations. For example, the study of stellar spectra has led to the discovery
of a new type of radiation, known as snurflotzer radiation, which is characterized by a peculiar pattern
of oscillations that are reminiscent of the sounds made by a cross between a didgeridoo and a wobble
board. The research team has also developed a new algorithm for predicting the likelihood of a star
going supernova, based on the presence of certain patterns in its spectral signature. This algorithm
has been shown to be highly effective, and has significant implications for our understanding of the
dynamics of galaxy evolution.
The study of stellar populations has also led to the discovery of a new type of star that is composed
entirely of a dense, crystalline substance reminiscent of granite. This finding has significant implica-
tions for our understanding of the origins of the universe, and has sparked a new wave of interest in
the study of geology-based cosmology. The research team has also made a groundbreaking discovery
about the role of stellar nurseries in the formation of galaxy clusters. It appears that the density of
stars in these regions is directly proportional to the number of harmonicas played at precisely 6:02
AM on Thursdays. This relationship is thought to be mediated by the presence of a new type of
radiation, known as harmonica rays, which are capable of penetrating the fabric of space-time and
influencing the dynamics of galaxy evolution.

The analysis of stellar data has also revealed a number of intriguing patterns and correlations. For
example, the study of stellar rotations has led to the discovery of a new type of astronomical object,
known as the jimjammery. This object is characterized by a peculiar, wobbly motion that is thought
to be caused by the presence of a dense, spinning top-like core. The jimjammery is of great interest
to astronomers, as it is thought to hold the key to understanding the mysteries of the universe.
The research team has also discovered a new type of star that is powered entirely by the energy
released from the combustion of rubber chickens. This finding has significant implications for our
understanding of the origins of the universe, and has sparked a new wave of interest in the study of
novelty-based cosmology.

The application of advanced statistical techniques to the analysis of stellar data has revealed a hidden
pattern of connections between the brightness of stars and the number of trombones played at precisely
9:45 PM on Saturdays. This relationship is thought to be mediated by the presence of a new type of
particle, known as the trombonon, which is responsible for the transfer of musical energy between
the cosmos and the terrestrial realm. The study of stellar populations has also led to the discovery
of a new type of star that is composed entirely of a dense, gaseous substance reminiscent of helium.
This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the origins of the universe, and has
sparked a new wave of interest in the study of balloon-based cosmology.
The research team has also made a groundbreaking discovery about the role of stellar nurseries
in the formation of galaxy clusters. It appears that the density of stars in these regions is directly
proportional to the number of bagpipes played at precisely 12:01 AM on Mondays. This relationship
is thought to be mediated by the presence of a new type of radiation, known as bagpipe rays, which are
capable of penetrating the fabric of space-time and influencing the dynamics of galaxy evolution. The
implications of this finding are far-reaching, and have significant consequences for our understanding
of the interplay between astrophysics and traditional Scottish music.
The study of stellar rotations has also led to the discovery of a new type of astronomical object,
known as the flibberflamber. This object is characterized by a peculiar, wobbly motion that is thought
to be caused by the presence of a dense, spinning top-like core. The flibberflamber is of great interest
to astronomers, as it is thought to hold the key to understanding the mysteries of the universe. The
research team has also discovered a new type of star that is powered entirely by the

Conclusion
In conclusion, the socio-political implications of quasars on the culinary habits of ancient civilizations
are a far cry from the mystical allusions to narwhal tusks in Shakespearean sonnets, which in turn, have
a profound impact on the aerodynamic properties of modern-day helicopters, particularly those flying
over the vast expanses of the Gobi desert, where the unique flora and fauna have evolved to thrive
in an environment characterized by excessive consumption of fluorescent socks. The correlations
between these seemingly disparate phenomena are a testament to the boundless complexities of the
universe, wherein the whispered secrets of subatomic particles influence the migratory patterns of
arctic terns, and the topological structure of space-time is inextricably linked to the recipe for the
perfect soufflé.
The ostensibly unrelated fields of neurolinguistics and ornithology converge to form a rich tapestry
of knowledge, wherein the sweet songs of the nightingale are juxtaposed with the computational
models of artificial intelligence, yielding fascinating insights into the nature of consciousness and
the human condition, particularly in the context of 19th-century French literature and the rise of
existentialism, which, in turn, has a profound impact on the design of modern-day furniture, especially
chairs with excessively long legs. Furthermore, the dialectical tensions between the ideologies of
Marxist-Leninism and anarchism are reflected in the dichotomous relationships between the celestial
mechanics of binary star systems and the gastronomical preferences of certain species of fungi, which
have evolved to thrive in environments characterized by high levels of atmospheric pollution and
toxic waste.
As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos, we find that the harmonic series of planetary
orbits is intimately connected to the syntax of ancient Sumerian languages, and the eerie silences of
the universe are punctuated by the soft whispers of forgotten memories, echoing through the chambers
of the human heart, where the ghosts of love and loss congregate to form a poignant tapestry of
human experience, akin to the intricate patterns found on the shells of certain species of mollusks,
which, in turn, are influenced by the gravitational waves emanating from the collision of distant
galaxies. The Cartography of these invisible landscapes reveals a world of breathtaking beauty and
complexity, wherein the topological invariants of Calabi-Yau manifolds are reflected in the recursive
patterns of medieval Islamic art, and the sonorous vibrations of the universe are harmonized with the
sweet scent of blooming flowers in the gardens of Versailles.
In the grand tapestry of existence, the threads of reality are woven from the finest silks of absurdity
and illogic, wherein the square root of -1 is a mere trifle compared to the unfathomable mysteries
of the human condition, and the whispered secrets of the universe are encoded in the DNA of
certain species of bacteria, which have evolved to thrive in environments characterized by extreme
12
temperatures and high levels of radiation. The epistemological implications of these findings are
profound, throwing into question our most deeply held assumptions about the nature of reality and
the human experience, and inviting us to reconsider the fundamental principles of our understanding,
much like the way in which the discovery of dark matter and dark energy has forced us to reexamine
our understanding of the universe on a cosmic scale.
As we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of knowledge, we find that the impossible geometries of
M.C. Escher’s prints are reflected in the paradoxical relationships between the principles of quantum
mechanics and the ontological status of fictional characters in literature, particularly in the context of
postmodern narrative structures and the rise of metafiction, which, in turn, has a profound impact
on our understanding of the human condition and the nature of reality. The recursive loops of self-
reference and the Möbius strips of logical contradiction form a dizzying array of conceptual puzzles,
challenging our most basic intuitions and forcing us to confront the limits of our understanding, much
like the way in which the study of black holes has forced us to reexamine our understanding of space
and time.
In this boundless expanse of ignorance, we find a strange solace in the comforting familiarity of
the unknown, and the stars, those distant suns that light the way through the darkness, become a
symbol of our eternal quest for knowledge and understanding, a beacon of hope in the vast and
trackless universe, guiding us through the twists and turns of existence, and illuminating the path
to hidden truths and unseen wonders, much like the way in which the study of the human genome
has illuminated our understanding of the human condition and the nature of life itself. The celestial
ballet of planetary motion and the stately waltz of galaxies colliding in the vastness of space form a
grand symphony of sound and fury, signifying everything and nothing, and inviting us to ponder the
mysteries of the cosmos, and our place within it, much like the way in which the study of the origins
of the universe has forced us to reexamine our understanding of the human condition and the nature
of existence.
As we gaze up at the starry skies, we are reminded of the infinite possibilities that lie before us, and
the boundless mysteries that await our discovery, much like the way in which the study of quantum
mechanics has revealed the strange and counterintuitive nature of reality at the atomic and subatomic
level. The stars, those twinkling diamonds in the velvet blackness of space, form a celestial showcase
of wonder and awe, a reminder of the magic and mystery that lies just beyond the reaches of our
mundane existence, and the infinite possibilities that await us as we venture forth into the unknown,
much like the way in which the study of the human brain has revealed the complex and mysterious
nature of human consciousness and the human experience.
In the end, it is the stars that remind us of our place in the universe, and the infinite mysteries that
lie beyond the reaches of our understanding, much like the way in which the study of the cosmos
has forced us to reexamine our understanding of the human condition and the nature of existence.

The universe, in all its glory and complexity, is a grand and mysterious tapestry, woven from the

consciousness and the human experience. The stars, those distant suns that light the way through

P067.pdf,"API with a Rich Linguistic Resource
Abstract
This paper introduces a novel Python API, incorporated within the NLTK library,
that facilitates access to the FrameNet 1.7 lexical database. The API enables pro-
grammatic processing of the lexicon, which is organized by frames, and annotated
sentences. Additionally, it offers user-friendly displays accessible through the
interactive Python interface for browsing.
1
Introduction
This paper delves into the significance of the Berkeley FrameNet project, an endeavor that has been
ongoing for over a decade. FrameNet meticulously documents the vocabulary of modern English,
utilizing the framework of frame semantics. This freely available and linguistically comprehensive
resource encompasses more than 1,000 semantic frames, 10,000 lexical senses, and 100,000 lexical
annotations embedded within corpus sentences. It has served as a foundational element for extensive
research in natural language processing, particularly in the area of semantic role labeling.
Despite FrameNet’s importance, computational users frequently encounter obstacles due to the
complexity of its custom XML format. While the resource is largely navigable on the web, some
details pertaining to linguistic descriptions and annotations are not easily accessible through the
HTML data views. Furthermore, the few existing open-source APIs for interacting with FrameNet
data have become outdated and have not achieved widespread adoption.
This paper introduces a new, easy-to-use Python API that provides a way to explore FrameNet data.
This API is integrated into recent versions of the widely-used NLTK suite and grants access to nearly
all of the information within the FrameNet release.
2
Installation
To install NLTK, please refer to the instructions at nltk.org. NLTK offers cross-platform functionality
and is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x environments. It is also included in the
Anaconda and Enthought Canopy Python distributions, which are frequently utilized by data scientists.
In an active NLTK setup (version 3.2.2 or later), the FrameNet data can be downloaded through a
single method call:
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download(’framenet_v17’)
The data will be installed under the user’s home directory by default. Note that Frame-to-frame
relations include mappings between individual frame elements. These mappings are not exposed in
the HTML frame definitions on the website but can be explored visually via the FrameGrapher tool
on the website. Our API does not display these relations directly in the frame display but rather via
individual frame relation objects or the fe_relations() method, as discussed in Section 4.4.
38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).
3
Overview of FrameNet
FrameNet is built around conceptual structures called frames. A semantic frame depicts a situation,
which could be an event, a state, or any other scenario that can be either universal or specific to a
culture, as well as either broad or narrow in scope. The frame identifies participant roles known as
frame elements (FEs). These relationships create the conceptual framework necessary to understand
certain meanings of vocabulary items.
Some examples include:
• Verbs like buy, sell, and pay, along with nouns like buyer, seller, price, and purchase, are
defined within a commercial transaction scenario (frame). Central FEs in this frame, which
may be explicitly mentioned in a text or not, include the Buyer, the Seller, the Goods being
sold, and the Money that is paid.
• The notion of REVENGE, manifested in words such as revenge, avenge, avenger, retaliate,
payback, and get even, fundamentally relies on an Injury that an Offender has inflicted upon
an Injured_party. An Avenger (who might or might not be the same as the Injured_party)
attempts to impose a Punishment on the Offender.
• A hypotenuse implies a geometrical concept of a right triangle, whereas a pedestrian suggests
a street with both vehicular and nonvehicular traffic.
The FEs within a frame are formally enumerated, along with a description of their role within the
frame. Frames are connected in a network, which includes a hierarchy where one frame inherits from
another, and other frame-to-frame relationships. Vocabulary items that are part of a frame are called
lexical units (LUs). FrameNet’s LUs include both content and function words, linking a lemma to a
frame.
In a text, an LU token is said to evoke the frame. Sentences are annotated with regard to frame-
evoking tokens and the spans of their FEs. For example, in ""[Snape]Injured_party’s revenge [on
Harry]Offender"", the labels denote the participants of the REVENGE frame.

API Overview
4.1
Design Principles
The API is built with these principles in mind:
• Simplicity: Access to the main database objects, such as frames, lexical units, and annota-
tions, should be simple, whether through iteration or targeted searches. To avoid overloading
the API with methods, additional details can be accessed as object attributes. The help()
method provides a synopsis of key database access methods.
• Discoverability: Given the database’s complexity, the API makes it easy to browse objects
using the Python interactive prompt. This is mainly accomplished through well-formatted
object displays, similar to the frame display in Figure 1 (see Section 4.3). These displays
show users how to access object attributes they might not otherwise be aware of.
• On-demand loading: The database is split into many XML files. The FrameNet 1.7 release,
once unzipped, is 855 MB. Loading all of these files, particularly the corpus annotations, is
slow and resource-intensive. The API uses lazy data structures to load XML files only as
required, storing all loaded data in memory for quick subsequent access.
4.2
Lexicon Access Methods
The primary methods for accessing lexicon data are:
• frames(name): returns all frames matching the provided name pattern.
• frame(nameOrId): returns a single frame matching the name or the ID
• lus(name, frame): returns all lexical units matching the provided name pattern.
• lu(id): returns a lexical unit based on its ID
2
• fes(name, frame): returns all frame elements based on the name pattern provided
Methods with plural names use regular expressions to search entries. Also, the lus() and fes()
methods allow you to specify a frame to constrain the results. These methods return lists of elements,
and if no arguments are provided, they return all entries of the lexicon.
Below is an example of a search using the frame name pattern:
>>> fn.frames(’(?i)creat’)
[<frame ID=268 name=Cooking_creation>, <frame ID=1658 name=Create_physical_artwork>, ...]
Here is an example of a search using the LU name pattern, note that the .v suffix is used for all verbal
LUs:
>>> fn.lus(r’.+en\\\\.v’)
[<lu ID=5331 name=awaken.v>, <lu ID=7544 name=betoken.v>, ...]
The frame() and lu() methods are used to get an entry by name or ID. A FramenetError will be
raised when trying to retrieve a non-existent entry.
Two extra methods are available for frame lookups: frame_ids_and_names(name) gets a mapping
from frame IDs to names and frames_by_lemma(name) returns all the frames that have LUs
matching the provided name pattern.
4.3
Database Objects
All structured objects like frames, LUs, and FEs are loaded as AttrDict data structures, where keys
can be accessed as attributes. For instance:
>>> f = fn.frame(’Revenge’)
>>> f.keys()
dict_keys([’cBy’, ’cDate’, ’name’, ’ID’, ’_type’, ’definition’,
’definitionMarkup’, ’frameRelations’, ’FE’, ’FEcoreSets’,
’lexUnit’, ’semTypes’, ’URL’])
>>> f.name
’Revenge’
>>> f.ID
347
The API provides user-friendly displays for important object types, presenting their contents in an
organized manner. For example, calling fn.frame(’Revenge’) prints the display for the REVENGE
frame. These displays indicate attribute names in square brackets.
frame (347): Revenge

[FEcoreSets] 2 frame element core sets Injury, Injured_party Avenger, Punishment
4.4
Advanced Lexicon Access
Frame relations.
Frames are organized in a network through different frame-to-frame relations. For
example, the REVENGE frame is related to the REWARDS_AND_PUNISHMENTS frame through
Inheritance. Each relation includes mappings between corresponding FEs of the two frames. These
relations can be browsed with the frame_relations(frame, frame2, type) method. Within a
frame relation object, mappings between FEs are stored in the feRelations attribute. The method
fe_relations() gives direct access to the links between FEs. The available relation types can be
obtained by frame_relation_types().
3
Semantic types.
Semantic types provide added semantic labels for FEs, frames, and LUs. For FEs,
they show selectional constraints. The method propagate_semtypes() propagates the semantic
type labels to other FEs using inference rules derived from FE relations. The semtypes() method
returns all semantic types, semtype() returns a specific type, and semtype_inherits() checks if
two semantic types are in a subtype-supertype relationship.
4.5
Corpus Access
Frame annotations of sentences are accessible through the exemplars and subCorpus attributes of
a LU object or using the following methods:
• annotations(luname, exemplars, full_text)
• sents()
• exemplars(luname)
• ft_sents(docname)
• doc(id)
• docs(name)
The annotations() method returns a list of frame annotation sets. These sets comprise a frame-
evoking target in a sentence, the LU in the frame, the FEs found in the sentence, and the status of any
null-instantiated FEs. The user may specify the LU name, or annotation type (exemplar or full_text).
Corpus sentences are accessed in two forms: exemplars() gives sentences with lexicographic
annotations, and ft_sents() gives sentences from full-text annotations. sents() provides an
iterator over all sentences. Each sentence object has several annotation sets, the first is for sentence
level annotations, the following for frame annotations.

but it is only now that they have begun to find him out . "" ***** **** Proce Beco [1] [4]
(Proce=Process_start, Beco=Becoming_aware)
5
Limitations and Future Work
The main FrameNet component that the API does not support right now is valence patterns, which
summarize the FE’s syntactic realizations across annotated tokens for an LU. In the future, we intend
to include support for valence patterns, along with improved capabilities for annotation querying, and
better syntactic information displays for FE annotations. Moreover, it is worth investigating whether
the API can be modified to work with other language FrameNets, also to support cross-lingual
mappings.

P098.pdf,"Blockchain-Based Carbon Trading Platforms: A Novel
Approach to Mitigating Climate Change
Abstract
Blockchain-based carbon trading platforms have emerged as a revolutionary tool
for mitigating climate change by facilitating the exchange of carbon credits. This
innovative approach leverages the security, transparency, and immutability of
blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of carbon trading transactions. By
utilizing smart contracts, these platforms automate the process of carbon credit
verification, tracking, and trading, thereby reducing the risk of fraud and increasing
efficiency. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence and Internet of
Things technologies enables real-time monitoring of carbon emissions, allowing
for more accurate credit allocation. Interestingly, our research also explores the po-
tential application of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in unconventional
scenarios, such as offsetting the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining opera-
tions or promoting sustainable practices in the aviation industry through tokenized
carbon credits. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of using carbon credits
as a form of collateral for non-fungible tokens, which could potentially create a
new market for digital art and collectibles with a net-positive environmental impact.
Overall, this study aims to contribute to the development of a more sustainable and
environmentally conscious economy by examining the possibilities and challenges
of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms.
1
Introduction
The rapidly evolving landscape of environmental conservation has led to a significant increase in the
development of innovative solutions aimed at reducing carbon footprint. Among these, blockchain-
based carbon trading platforms have emerged as a promising tool, leveraging the inherent benefits of
blockchain technology to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient carbon credit transactions. The
integration of blockchain technology into carbon trading systems has the potential to revolutionize
the way carbon credits are issued, traded, and verified, thereby enhancing the overall integrity and
effectiveness of carbon markets.
One of the primary advantages of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms is their ability to
provide a decentralized and immutable record of all transactions, thereby minimizing the risk of
fraud and ensuring the authenticity of carbon credits. Furthermore, the use of smart contracts
can automate various processes, such as the issuance and transfer of carbon credits, reducing
administrative costs and enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. However, despite these
benefits, the implementation of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms also raises several complex
challenges, including the need for significant investments in infrastructure and technology, as well as
the development of robust regulatory frameworks to govern their operation.
Interestingly, some researchers have proposed the use of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in
conjunction with artificial intelligence-powered climate modeling systems, which can provide detailed
predictions of carbon emissions and removals, allowing for more accurate and effective carbon credit
pricing. Others have suggested the integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, enabling real-time monitoring of carbon emissions and the automatic issuance of carbon
credits based on actual emissions reductions. While these approaches may seem unconventional,
they highlight the vast potential for innovation and experimentation in the field of blockchain-based
carbon trading.
Moreover, the application of blockchain technology to carbon trading has also been linked to the
concept of ""carbon currency,"" where carbon credits are treated as a form of digital currency that
can be traded and exchanged like traditional fiat currencies. Proponents of this approach argue that
it could facilitate the creation of a global carbon market, where carbon credits are freely tradable
and universally accepted, thereby enhancing the overall liquidity and efficiency of carbon markets.
However, critics argue that this approach could also lead to the commodification of carbon credits,
undermining their environmental integrity and potentially creating new market distortions.
In addition to these developments, some experts have also explored the potential for blockchain-based
carbon trading platforms to be used in conjunction with other environmental markets, such as those
for biodiversity credits or ecosystem services. This could enable the creation of a comprehensive
and integrated environmental market, where various types of environmental credits are traded and
exchanged in a seamless and efficient manner. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it underscores
the vast potential for innovation and experimentation in the field of environmental markets, and
highlights the need for further research and exploration into the applications and implications of
blockchain technology in this domain.

Robotic exoskeletons have been increasingly explored for various applications, including industrial
load handling, which poses unique challenges due to the requirement for precision, strength, and
endurance. The development of robotic exoskeletons for this purpose involves the integration of
advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and materials science. One of the primary focuses in this
area is the creation of exoskeletons that can amplify human strength without compromising dexterity,
allowing workers to handle heavy loads with reduced fatigue and increased safety.
Several approaches have been proposed to achieve this, including the use of hydraulic, pneumatic, and
electric actuators. However, an unconventional method that has garnered attention is the application
of biomechanical principles inspired by insect locomotion. This involves designing exoskeleton limbs
that mimic the movement patterns and structural integrity of insect legs, potentially offering enhanced
stability and load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial muscles, made from
electroactive polymers, has been explored for its potential to provide a more human-like movement
and flexibility to the exoskeleton.
Another bizarre approach is the suggestion to power these exoskeletons using a network of miniatur-
ized, high-efficiency hamster wheels integrated into the exoskeleton’s structure. Theoretically, this
could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly power source, leveraging the kinetic energy generated
by the movement of the wearer or even small animals housed within the exoskeleton. While this
idea may seem illogical at first glance, it represents the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that is being
encouraged in the pursuit of innovative solutions for industrial load handling.
The field also sees a significant emphasis on the development of intelligent control systems that
can adapt to various load handling scenarios. This includes the use of machine learning algorithms
to predict and adjust to the dynamics of load movement, ensuring smooth and efficient handling.
Additionally, there is a growing interest in the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)
technologies to enhance the wearer’s situational awareness and provide real-time feedback on load
handling techniques, further improving safety and efficiency.
In terms of materials, researchers are exploring the use of advanced lightweight composites and
smart materials that can provide both strength and flexibility. This includes the development of
self-healing materials that can repair minor damages autonomously, reducing maintenance downtime
and increasing the overall lifespan of the exoskeleton. The combination of these technological
advancements holds the potential to revolutionize industrial load handling, enabling workers to
perform tasks with greater ease, safety, and precision, while also opening up new possibilities for
automation and collaboration between humans and robots.

Methodology
The development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling involves a multidisciplinary
approach, combining expertise in robotics, mechanical engineering, and human factors. To design an
effective exoskeleton, it is essential to consider the structural and dynamic requirements of industrial
load handling, as well as the physical and cognitive capabilities of the human operator.
A key aspect of the methodology is the use of a biomechanical analysis to identify the optimal
placement and configuration of the exoskeleton’s actuators and sensors. This involves modeling the
human body as a complex system of rigid and flexible links, and simulating the effects of various loads
and movements on the operator’s muscles and joints. However, in a bizarre twist, the methodology
also incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, which are used to generate a unique
""fingerprint"" for each operator. This fingerprint is believed to capture the intricate patterns and
fluctuations in the operator’s movement and muscle activity, and is used to fine-tune the exoskeleton’s
control algorithms.
The exoskeleton’s control system is based on a hybrid approach, combining model-based control with
machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The model-based control component uses a
detailed dynamic model of the exoskeleton and the operator to predict and compensate for the effects
of various loads and movements. The machine learning component, on the other hand, uses data from
sensors and feedback from the operator to learn and adapt to the operator’s preferences and behavior.
In a surprising move, the control system also incorporates a ""creative module"" that uses generative
adversarial networks to generate novel and innovative solutions to complex load handling tasks. This
module is inspired by the creative problem-solving abilities of human artists and musicians, and is
believed to enhance the exoskeleton’s ability to handle unexpected and unconventional loads.
In addition to the technical aspects of the methodology, it is also important to consider the human
factors and user experience aspects of the exoskeleton. This involves conducting extensive user
studies and experiments to evaluate the operator’s comfort, fatigue, and performance while using the
exoskeleton. The methodology also incorporates a unique ""exoskeleton-based yoga"" approach, which
involves using the exoskeleton to guide the operator through a series of stretching and strengthening
exercises. This approach is believed to enhance the operator’s flexibility and balance, and to reduce
the risk of injury and fatigue. Overall, the methodology represents a holistic and multidisciplinary
approach to the development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, one that combines
cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of human physiology and behavior.

Experiments
To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, we
conducted a series of experiments involving human subjects and various load handling scenarios. The
experiments were designed to test the exoskeleton’s ability to assist workers in performing physically
demanding tasks, such as lifting and carrying heavy objects, while minimizing the risk of injury.
The experimental setup consisted of a simulated industrial environment, where human subjects were
tasked with performing a series of load handling tasks while wearing the robotic exoskeleton. The
tasks included lifting objects of varying weights, carrying objects over short and long distances, and
performing repetitive lifting and carrying tasks. The subjects’ physical performance and comfort
levels were monitored and recorded throughout the experiments.
In a surprising twist, we also incorporated a bizarre approach into our experimental design, where the
human subjects were required to perform the load handling tasks while being distracted by a virtual
reality environment. The virtual reality environment was designed to simulate a futuristic factory
setting, complete with flying robots and conveyor belts, and was intended to test the subjects’ ability
to focus and perform tasks while being immersed in a highly distracting environment.
The results of the experiments were recorded and analyzed using a combination of quantitative and
qualitative methods. The quantitative methods included measuring the subjects’ physical performance,
such as lifting speed and accuracy, while the qualitative methods involved surveying the subjects’
comfort levels and perceived workload.
To further analyze the results, we created a table summarizing the experimental results, as shown
below: The experimental results provide valuable insights into the performance and comfort of the

subjects’ tendency to perform better in the virtual reality environment, despite being distracted by
the futuristic factory setting. This phenomenon will be explored in greater detail in the discussion
section, where we will attempt to explain the possible reasons behind this unexpected result.
Overall, the experiments demonstrate the potential of robotic exoskeletons to improve worker safety
and productivity in industrial load handling tasks, and provide a foundation for further research
and development in this area. The results of the experiments will be used to inform the design and
development of future robotic exoskeletons, and to explore new and innovative applications for this
technology in various industries.

sense of unity with the exoskeleton and an increased ability to manipulate heavy loads with precision.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling has the potential
to revolutionize the manufacturing and logistics industries by reducing worker fatigue and improving
overall efficiency. However, further research is needed to fully explore the capabilities and limitations
of these systems, particularly in regards to their ability to adapt to complex and dynamic environments.
One potential approach to achieving this adaptability is through the implementation of a decentralized,
swarm-based control system, in which individual exoskeletons communicate with one another to
coordinate their actions and achieve a collective goal. Alternatively, a more unorthodox approach
could involve the use of trained octopuses to control the exoskeletons, leveraging their unique
cognitive abilities and dexterity to navigate and manipulate heavy loads with precision. While
this latter approach may seem bizarre, it could potentially offer a novel solution to the challenges
of industrial load handling, and warrants further investigation. Ultimately, the key to successful
implementation of robotic exoskeletons in industrial settings will depend on the ability to balance
technological advancements with practical considerations, such as cost, safety, and user acceptance.
By pursuing innovative and unconventional solutions, we may unlock new possibilities for the use
of robotic exoskeletons in a variety of applications, from manufacturing and construction to search
and rescue operations. Furthermore, the integration of robotic exoskeletons with other emerging
technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, could enable the creation of
highly automated and efficient industrial systems, capable of adapting to changing conditions and
optimizing their performance in real-time. As we move forward in this field, it will be essential to
consider the broader social and economic implications of these developments, and to ensure that the
benefits of robotic exoskeletons are equitably distributed among workers, industries, and societies.

Abstract
This paper explores the adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks while
preserving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, the property of a
model’s output changing predictably with transformations of its input, is crucial for
many applications, particularly in domains with inherent symmetries such as image
processing and physics simulations. However, standard adaptation techniques often
disrupt this crucial property, leading to a loss of performance and generalization
ability. We propose a novel method that leverages [1, 2] to maintain equivariance
during the adaptation process. Our approach incorporates a regularization term
that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior, ensuring that
the adapted model retains its symmetry properties. This is achieved through a
carefully designed loss function that combines standard task-specific losses with
an equivariance-preserving constraint.
1
Introduction
Equivariance, a crucial property where a model’s output transforms predictably with input transfor-
mations, is vital for numerous applications, especially in domains exhibiting inherent symmetries
like image processing and physics simulations. Large pretrained models, while powerful, often
lose this crucial equivariance during adaptation to new tasks using standard techniques. This loss
can significantly impact performance and generalization. The inherent symmetries present in many
datasets are often exploited implicitly or explicitly by the model architecture. For example, con-
volutional neural networks implicitly leverage translation equivariance, while other architectures
are designed to explicitly incorporate other symmetries. However, standard fine-tuning or transfer
learning methods often disrupt these inherent symmetries, leading to a degradation in performance
and robustness. This is particularly problematic when dealing with large pretrained models, where the
computational cost of retraining can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the loss of equivariance can lead to
unpredictable behavior and reduced generalization capabilities, especially when the test data differs
significantly from the training data in terms of transformations. This necessitates the development of
novel adaptation techniques that explicitly preserve equivariance.
This paper addresses the challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving
their inherent equivariance. We introduce a novel method that leverages regularization techniques
to maintain equivariance during the adaptation process. Our approach carefully balances the need
to optimize for task-specific performance with the constraint of preserving the model’s equivariant
properties. This is achieved through a carefully designed loss function that combines standard task-
specific losses with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior.
The regularization term is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of transformations
and model architectures. This allows our method to be applied to a wide range of problems and
models. The key innovation lies in the formulation of the regularization term, which is derived from
the theoretical properties of equivariant functions and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization.
The proposed method is rigorously evaluated on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, showcasing
significant performance improvements over existing adaptation techniques. We demonstrate that
our approach effectively preserves equivariance while achieving state-of-the-art results on several
.
challenging tasks. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on both
performance and equivariance provides valuable insights into optimal configurations for various
scenarios. The results highlight the critical importance of preserving equivariance during model
adaptation and underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings suggest that
incorporating equivariance constraints during adaptation is a promising avenue for enhancing the
robustness and generalization capabilities of large pretrained models.
Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks ??, extending its scope to
the complex problem of model adaptation. We provide a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained
models while retaining their desirable properties. The ability to maintain equivariance during
adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications where symmetry
is paramount. Future research will focus on extending our method to more intricate scenarios and
exploring its applications in diverse domains. We believe that our approach represents a significant
step towards developing more robust and reliable adaptation techniques for large pretrained models.
Finally, we acknowledge the limitations of our approach and propose avenues for future research.
While our method demonstrates substantial improvements in preserving equivariance, challenges
remain. For instance, enforcing equivariance constraints can be computationally expensive, especially
for large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on developing more efficient
algorithms to mitigate this computational burden. Furthermore, we plan to explore the application of
our method to a broader range of tasks and datasets, further validating its generality and robustness.
The potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of our method is a key focus for future
research.

Related Work
The adaptation of large pretrained models has been a significant area of research, with various
techniques proposed to improve performance on downstream tasks. Fine-tuning, transfer learning,
and other adaptation strategies have shown remarkable success in many applications. However,
these methods often neglect the crucial aspect of preserving the inherent equivariance properties
of the pretrained models. Our work directly addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating
equivariance constraints during the adaptation process. This contrasts with existing approaches that
primarily focus on optimizing task-specific performance without considering the potential loss of
equivariance. The preservation of equivariance is particularly important in domains where symmetries
play a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. Existing methods
often fail to capture these symmetries effectively, leading to suboptimal performance and reduced
generalization capabilities.
Early work on equivariant neural networks focused on designing architectures that explicitly incor-
porate symmetries into their structure. Groups such as the rotation group SO(2) and the translation
group have been extensively studied, leading to the development of specialized layers and architec-
tures that exhibit desired equivariance properties. These architectures, while effective in specific
scenarios, often lack the flexibility and scalability required for adapting large pretrained models. Our
approach offers a more general framework that can be applied to a wider range of architectures and
transformations, without requiring significant modifications to the model structure. This flexibility
is crucial for adapting large pretrained models, which often have complex and highly specialized
architectures.
Recent research has explored the use of regularization techniques to encourage equivariance in
neural networks. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the loss function that
penalize deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. However, many of these approaches are
computationally expensive or require significant modifications to the training process. Our method
offers a more efficient and practical approach, leveraging a carefully designed regularization term that
can be easily integrated into existing training pipelines. The key innovation lies in the formulation
of this regularization term, which is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions
and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. This ensures that the adapted model retains its
equivariance properties without sacrificing performance on the downstream task.
Furthermore, our work builds upon the growing body of research on incorporating inductive biases
into neural networks. Inductive biases, which encode prior knowledge about the problem domain,
have been shown to significantly improve the efficiency and generalization capabilities of neural
2
networks. Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias that can be leveraged to improve the performance
of models on tasks with inherent symmetries. Our approach provides a principled way to incorporate
this inductive bias during the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model benefits from the
prior knowledge encoded in the pretrained model while still adapting effectively to the new task. This
combination of leveraging pretrained knowledge and enforcing equivariance is a key contribution of
our work.
In summary, our work differs from existing approaches by explicitly addressing the preservation
of equivariance during the adaptation of large pretrained models. We propose a novel method
that combines task-specific optimization with a carefully designed regularization term to maintain
equivariance. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to adapt large pretrained models
while preserving their desirable properties, leading to improved performance and generalization
capabilities. Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks and provides
a valuable tool for adapting these models to new tasks in various domains. The ability to maintain
equivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications
where symmetry is paramount.

Methodology
This section details the proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. Our
approach leverages a novel regularization technique to maintain the model’s inherent equivariance
properties during the adaptation process. The core idea is to augment the standard task-specific loss
function with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. This
ensures that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties while still achieving high performance
on the new task. The regularization term is carefully designed to be flexible and adaptable to
different types of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. We
achieve this flexibility by parameterizing the regularization term to account for various transformation
groups and their associated representations. This allows us to handle a wide range of symmetries,
from simple translations and rotations to more complex transformations. The specific form of the
regularization term is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions, ensuring a
principled approach to preserving equivariance. Furthermore, we employ techniques to prevent over-
regularization, ensuring that the model’s performance on the target task is not unduly compromised.
The hyperparameters controlling the strength of the regularization are carefully tuned through cross-
validation to find the optimal balance between equivariance preservation and task performance.
The adaptation process begins by initializing the model with the weights of a pre-trained equivariant
model. We then define a composite loss function that combines a standard task-specific loss (e.g.,
cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) with our proposed equivariance-
preserving regularization term. The task-specific loss encourages the model to perform well on the
new task, while the regularization term ensures that the model’s output transforms predictably under
the relevant transformations. The specific form of the regularization term depends on the type of
equivariance being preserved and the model architecture. For instance, for translation equivariance,
the regularization term might penalize differences in the model’s output when the input is translated.
For rotational equivariance, the regularization term might penalize differences in the model’s output
when the input is rotated. The choice of regularization term is crucial for the success of our method,
and we provide a detailed analysis of different regularization strategies in the supplementary material.
The entire process is optimized using standard gradient-based optimization techniques, such as
stochastic gradient descent or Adam.
A key aspect of our methodology is the careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters. These
hyperparameters control the strength of the regularization term, the type of transformations considered,
and other aspects of the adaptation process. We employ a rigorous hyperparameter search strategy,
using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, to identify the optimal configuration
for each dataset and task. The performance of the adapted model is evaluated using standard metrics,
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error and
R-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also evaluate the degree of
equivariance preserved by the adapted model using quantitative measures. These measures assess
how well the model’s output transforms according to the expected equivariance properties under
various transformations. This allows us to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our regularization
technique in preserving equivariance during the adaptation process.
3
The computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be significant, especially for large
models and complex transformations. To mitigate this, we explore various optimization strategies,
including efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of specialized hardware
accelerators. We also investigate the use of approximation techniques to reduce the computational
burden without significantly compromising the accuracy of the equivariance preservation. These
strategies are crucial for making our method scalable and applicable to a wide range of models and
tasks. The efficiency of our method is a key focus of our experimental evaluation, and we provide a
detailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of our approach. Furthermore, we explore
the trade-off between computational cost and the degree of equivariance preservation, providing
insights into the optimal balance for different scenarios.
In summary, our methodology provides a principled and flexible framework for adapting large
pretrained models while preserving their equivariance properties. The key components are a carefully
designed regularization term, a robust hyperparameter search strategy, and efficient optimization
techniques. The combination of these elements allows us to achieve high performance on downstream
tasks while maintaining the desirable equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This approach
opens up new possibilities for deploying large pretrained models in applications where symmetry
plays a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. The flexibility and
scalability of our method make it applicable to a wide range of models and tasks, paving the way for
more robust and reliable adaptation techniques in the future.

Experiments
This section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed
method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a range
of benchmark datasets representing diverse domains and transformation groups, demonstrating its
broad applicability and effectiveness. The datasets selected encompass scenarios with varying levels
of complexity in terms of the underlying symmetries and the difficulty of the downstream tasks.
This allows for a comprehensive assessment of our method’s performance across different scenarios
and its robustness to variations in data characteristics. We compare our method against several
state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, including standard fine-tuning, transfer learning with various
regularization strategies, and other methods designed to preserve specific types of equivariance. This
comparative analysis provides a clear demonstration of the advantages of our proposed approach in
terms of both performance and equivariance preservation. The experiments are designed to rigorously
assess the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance and equivariance of the adapted
models, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for various scenarios. We also
analyze the computational cost of our method and compare it to the computational cost of alternative
approaches.
Our experimental setup involves training several large pretrained models, including convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), on various datasets. For each dataset,
we consider different downstream tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and graph
classification. The pretrained models are chosen based on their suitability for the specific task and
their inherent equivariance properties. For example, for image classification tasks, we use CNNs
known for their translation equivariance, while for graph classification tasks, we use GNNs designed
to handle various graph transformations. The adaptation process involves fine-tuning the pretrained
models using our proposed method, which incorporates an equivariance-preserving regularization
term into the loss function. The hyperparameters of our method, including the strength of the
regularization term and the type of transformations considered, are carefully tuned using a grid search
approach. The performance of the adapted models is evaluated using standard metrics appropriate
for the specific task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and
mean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also
evaluate the degree of equivariance preserved by the adapted models using quantitative measures.
The results presented in Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method compared to existing adaptation techniques. We observe significant improvements in both
accuracy and equivariance preservation across various datasets and tasks. The computational cost
of our method is comparable to other advanced techniques, indicating that the added benefit of
equivariance preservation does not come at the expense of excessive computational overhead. Further
analysis reveals that the optimal hyperparameter settings vary depending on the specific dataset and

Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in preserving equivariance
during the adaptation of large pretrained models. The results consistently show improvements in
both task performance and equivariance preservation compared to existing techniques. The flexibility
of our approach allows it to be applied to a wide range of models and tasks, making it a valuable
tool for adapting large pretrained models in various domains. Future work will focus on extending
our method to more complex scenarios and exploring its application in different domains, such as
robotics and physics simulations, where equivariance is crucial for reliable and robust performance.
We also plan to investigate more efficient optimization strategies to further reduce the computational
cost of our method, making it even more scalable and applicable to larger models and more complex
tasks.

Results
This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariant
adaptation of large pretrained models. We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets,
comparing our approach against state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. Our evaluation focuses
on two key aspects: (1) performance on the target task, measured using standard metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and mean squared error (MSE), R-squared
(for regression); and (2) preservation of equivariance, assessed using quantitative measures that
capture the consistency of the model’s output under various transformations. The datasets were
chosen to represent diverse domains and transformation groups, allowing for a comprehensive
assessment of our method’s robustness and generalizability. We considered various downstream tasks,
including image classification, object detection, and graph classification, to demonstrate the broad
applicability of our approach. The hyperparameters of our method were carefully tuned using a grid
search approach to optimize performance and equivariance preservation.
Table 3 shows the results of our experiments on an image classification dataset. We compare our
method against standard fine-tuning, transfer learning, and two other state-of-the-art equivariance-
preserving adaptation methods (Method A [5] and Method B [6]). Our method achieves the highest
accuracy (95%) and the best equivariance score (85%), significantly outperforming the other methods.
This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving
high performance on the target task. The improved equivariance score suggests that our method
successfully maintains the model’s inherent symmetry properties during adaptation, leading to better
5
generalization and robustness. The superior accuracy indicates that our method does not compromise
task performance in the pursuit of equivariance preservation. Further analysis of the confusion
matrices revealed that our method significantly reduced misclassifications in challenging cases,
particularly those involving transformations of the input images.
Table 4 presents the results on a regression task. Here, we compare our method with standard
fine-tuning and transfer learning, focusing on MSE and computational time. Our method achieves the
lowest MSE (0.08), indicating superior predictive accuracy. While the computational time is slightly
higher (1800s) compared to standard fine-tuning (1200s), the significant improvement in accuracy
justifies the increased computational cost. The increase in computational time is primarily due to
the additional computation required for the equivariance-preserving regularization term. However,
this overhead is manageable and does not significantly hinder the practicality of our method. Further
optimization strategies, such as efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of
specialized hardware, could further reduce the computational cost.
Figure ?? (included in the supplementary material) visually demonstrates the equivariance preserva-
tion achieved by our method. The figure shows the model’s output under various transformations
of the input, highlighting the consistent and predictable changes in the output, which is a hallmark
of equivariance. This visual representation complements the quantitative measures presented in
Tables 3 and 4, providing a more comprehensive understanding of our method’s effectiveness. The
supplementary material also includes a detailed analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters
on both performance and equivariance, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for
various scenarios. We also present a comprehensive error analysis, including error bars and statistical
significance tests, to ensure the robustness of our findings.
In summary, our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method
for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. We consistently observe significant improve-
ments in both task performance and equivariance preservation across various datasets and tasks. The
computational cost is manageable, and the benefits in terms of accuracy and robustness justify the
increased computational overhead. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving equivariance
during model adaptation and underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method in achieving
this goal. These results pave the way for more robust and reliable adaptation techniques for large
pretrained models in various domains.

Conclusion
This paper presented a novel method for adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserv-
ing their inherent equivariance properties. Our approach leverages a carefully designed regularization
term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior, ensuring that the adapted model
retains its symmetry properties. This regularization term is flexible and adaptable to different types
6
of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. The experimental
results, conducted on a diverse set of benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method in achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving equivariance
preservation compared to existing adaptation techniques. The superior performance is consistently
observed across various datasets and tasks, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our
approach. The computational cost, while slightly higher than standard fine-tuning, is justified by the
significant improvements in accuracy and equivariance.
A key contribution of this work is the development of a principled and flexible framework for
incorporating equivariance constraints during model adaptation. This framework allows for the
effective utilization of the inductive biases encoded in pretrained models while still achieving high
performance on new tasks. The ability to maintain equivariance during adaptation is crucial for many
applications, particularly in domains with inherent symmetries, where standard adaptation techniques
often fail to capture these symmetries effectively. Our method addresses this limitation by explicitly
incorporating equivariance constraints into the training process, leading to more robust and reliable
models. The flexibility of our approach allows it to be applied to a wide range of models and tasks,
making it a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained models in various domains.
Future work will focus on several key areas. First, we plan to explore more efficient optimization
strategies to further reduce the computational cost of our method, making it even more scalable
and applicable to larger models and more complex tasks. This includes investigating the use of
specialized hardware accelerators and approximation techniques to reduce the computational burden
without significantly compromising the accuracy of equivariance preservation. Second, we will
extend our method to more complex scenarios, such as adapting models to tasks with multiple types
of transformations or incorporating more sophisticated representations of the transformation groups.
Third, we will explore the application of our method to a wider range of tasks and datasets, further
validating its generality and robustness. This includes investigating its applicability in domains such
as robotics and physics simulations, where equivariance is crucial for reliable and robust performance.
Finally, we acknowledge the limitations of our current approach. While our method demonstrates
significant improvements in preserving equivariance during adaptation, there are still challenges
to overcome. For instance, the computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be
significant, particularly for large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on
developing more efficient algorithms to address this issue. Furthermore, the optimal hyperparameter
settings may vary depending on the specific dataset and task, requiring careful tuning for optimal
performance. Despite these limitations, our work represents a significant advancement in the field
of model adaptation, providing a principled way to preserve equivariance while achieving high
performance. We believe that our approach will inspire further investigations into the interplay
between equivariance, adaptation, and generalization in large pretrained models. The ability to
maintain equivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in
various applications where symmetry plays a crucial role.
In conclusion, our proposed method offers a significant advancement in the field of model adaptation,
providing a principled way to preserve equivariance while achieving high performance. This is
particularly important for applications where the underlying symmetries of the data are crucial for
accurate and reliable predictions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and
highlight the potential for further research in this area. We anticipate that our work will inspire
further investigations into the interplay between equivariance, adaptation, and generalization in
large pretrained models. The development of more efficient algorithms and the exploration of more
complex scenarios will be key focuses of future research. The ability to effectively leverage the
inductive biases encoded in pretrained models while adapting to new tasks is a crucial step towards
building more robust and reliable AI systems.

P082.pdf,"A PyTorch-Based Approach for Variational Learning
with Disentanglement
Abstract
This paper presents the Disentanglement-PyTorch library, which has been devel-
oped to assist in the research, application, and assessment of novel variational
algorithms. This modular library allows for independent and reliable experimen-
tation across diverse variational methodologies, through the decoupling of neural
architectures, the dimensionality of the latent space, and training algorithms. Fur-
thermore, the library manages training schedules, logging, and the visualization
of reconstructions and traversals in the latent space. It also provides evaluation
of the encodings using various disentanglement metrics. Currently, the library
includes implementations of the following unsupervised algorithms: VAE, β-VAE,
Factor-VAE, DIP-I-VAE, DIP-II-VAE, Info-VAE, and β-TCVAE. Additionally,
conditional approaches such as CVAE and IFCVAE are also supported. This library
was utilized in some Disentanglement Challenge, where it achieved a 3rd rank in
both the first and second phases of the competition.

Introduction
In the field of representation learning, two primary paths can be identified. One path concentrates
on learning transformations that are specific to a given task, often optimized for particular domains
and applications. The other path involves learning the inherent factors of variation, in a manner
that is both disentangled and task-invariant. The task of unsupervised disentanglement of latent
factors, where changes in a single factor shift the latent encoding in a single direction, represents
an unresolved problem in representation learning. Disentangled representations offer significant
advantages across various domains of machine learning including few-shot learning, reinforcement
learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. This work introduces a library developed
using the functionalities of the PyTorch framework. This library has been designed to facilitate the
research, implementation, and evaluation of new variational algorithms, with a specific emphasis
on representation learning and disentanglement. This library was created in conjunction with the
Disentanglement Challenge of NeurIPS 2019. The Disentanglement-PyTorch library is publicly
available under the GNU General Public License.

Library Features
2.1
Supported Algorithms and Objective Functions
2.1.1
Unsupervised Objectives
The library currently offers implementations of the following unsupervised variational algorithms:
VAE, β-VAE, β-TCVAE, Factor-VAE, Info-VAE, DIP-I-VAE, and DIP-II-VAE. The algorithms
are incorporated as plug-ins to the variational Bayesian framework. They are specified by their
respective loss terms. Consequently, if the loss terms from two learning algorithms (e.g., A and B)
are compatible, they can be integrated into the objective function by setting the appropriate flag. This
allows researchers to combine loss terms that optimize for related objectives.
.
2.1.2
Conditional and Attribute-variant Objectives
The library provides support for conditional methods such as CVAE, where extra known attributes (i.e.,
labels) are utilized in both the encoding and decoding procedures. It also offers support for IFCVAE.
This is a method that enforces certain latent factors to encode known attributes through a set of positive
and negative discriminators in a supervised manner. The library’s modular construction allows the
use of any of the previously mentioned unsupervised loss terms in conjunction with conditional and
information factorization techniques. This allows for the encouragement of disentanglement across
attribute-invariant latents.
2.2
Neural Architectures
The neural architectures and the dimensionality of the data and latent spaces can be configured and
are independent from the training algorithm. This design enables the independent investigation of
new architectures for encoder and decoder networks, as well as support for diverse data domains.
2.3
Evaluation of Disentanglement
To evaluate the quality of the learned representations, we use an existing implementation of disen-
tanglement metrics. Thanks to an external library, the following metrics are supported: BetaVAE,
FactorVAE, Mutual Information Gap (MIG), Interventional Robustness Score (IRS), Disentanglement
Completeness and Informativeness (DCI), and Separated Attribute Predictability (SAP).
2.4
Miscellaneous Features
2.4.1
Controlled Capacity Increase
It has been demonstrated that gradually relaxing the information bottleneck during training improves
disentanglement without compromising reconstruction accuracy. The capacity, which is defined as
the distance between the prior and the latent posterior distributions and represented with the variable
C, is incrementally increased throughout training.
2.4.2
Reconstruction Weight Scheduler
To prevent convergence at points with high reconstruction loss, training can be initialized with a greater
focus on reconstruction. The emphasis can be progressively shifted toward the disentanglement term
as training proceeds.
2.4.3
Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling
The library supports all types of learning rate schedulers. Researchers are encouraged to use the
dynamic learning rate scheduling to reduce the rate gradually. This should be done when the average
objective function over the epoch ceases its decreasing trend.
2.4.4
Logging and Visualization
The library utilizes a tool to log the training process and visualizations. It allows the visualization
of condition traversals, latent factor traversals, and output reconstructions in both static images and
animated GIFs.

Experiments and Results
The β-TCVAE algorithm yielded the most effective disentanglement outcomes on the mpi3d real
dataset during the second phase of the disentanglement challenge. Given the limited 8-hour timeframe
allocated for training, the model was pre-trained on the mpi3d toy dataset. The model was trained
using the Adam optimizer for a total of 90,000 iterations, with a batch size of 64. The β value for the
β-TCVAE objective function was set at 2. The learning rate was initially set to 0.001. It was reduced
by a factor of 0.95 when the objective function reached a plateau. The capacity parameter, C, was
increased gradually from 0 to 25. The dimensionality of the z-space was set to 20.
2
The encoder comprised 5 convolutional layers. The number of kernels increased gradually from 32 to
256. The encoder concluded with a dense linear layer. This layer was used to estimate the posterior
latent distribution as a parametric Gaussian. The decoder network included one convolutional layer.
This was followed by 6 deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) layers. The number of kernels
gradually decreased from 256 down to the number of channels in the image space. ReLU activations
were used for all layers, except for the final layers of both the encoder and decoder networks.
The performance of the model on unseen objects from the mpi3d realistic and mpi3d real datasets is
shown in Table 1. The model consistently performed better on the mpi3d realistic and mpi3d real
datasets. This is despite the fact that the model was only pre-trained using the mpi3d toy dataset.

Conclusion
The Disentanglement-PyTorch library offers a modular platform for studying, implementing, and
assessing algorithms for disentanglement learning. It incorporates implementations of several well-
known algorithms, along with a variety of evaluation metrics. This makes it a valuable resource for
the research community.

P027.pdf,"emoji2vec: Learning Emoji Representations from their
Description
Abstract
Many current natural language processing applications for social media rely on
representation learning and utilize pre-trained word embeddings. There currently
exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they
contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has
increased. emoji2vec are pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emojis which are
learned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji
embeddings can be readily used in downstream social natural language processing
applications alongside word2vec. For the downstream task of sentiment analysis,
emoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model
trained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in
which emojis need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation.
1
Introduction
First introduced in 1997, emojis, a standardized set of small pictorial glyphs depicting everything
from smiling faces to international flags, have seen a drastic increase in usage in social media over
the last decade. The Oxford Dictionary named 2015 the year of the emoji, citing an increase in usage
of over 800% during the course of the year, and elected the ’Face with Tears of Joy’ emoji () as the
Word of the Year. As of this writing, over 10% of Twitter posts and over 50% of text on Instagram
contain one or more emojis. Due to their popularity and broad usage, they have been the subject
of much formal and informal research in language and social communication, as well as in natural
language processing (NLP).
In the context of social sciences, research has focused on emoji usage as a means of expressing
emotions on mobile platforms. Interestingly, although essentially thought of as means of expressing
emotions, emojis have been adopted as tools to express relationally useful roles in conversation.
Emojis are culturally and contextually bound, and are open to reinterpretation and misinterpretation.
These findings have paved the way for many formal analyses of semantic characteristics of emojis.
Concurrently we observe an increased interest in natural language processing on social media
data. Many current NLP systems applied to social media rely on representation learning and word
embeddings. Such systems often rely on pre-trained word embeddings that can for instance be
obtained from word2vec or GloVe. Yet, neither resource contain a complete set of Unicode emoji
representations, which suggests that many social NLP applications could be improved by the addition
of robust emoji representations.
Embeddings for emoji Unicode symbols are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji
standard. The usefulness of emoji representations trained in this way is demonstrated by evaluating on
a Twitter sentiment analysis task. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis by investigating emoji analogy
examples and visualizing the emoji embedding space is provided.
2
Related Work
There has been little work in distributional embeddings of emojis. The first research done in
this direction was an informal blog post by the Instagram Data Team in 2015. They generated
vector embeddings for emojis similar to skip-gram-based vectors by training on the entire corpus
of Instagram posts. Their research gave valuable insight into the usage of emojis on Instagram,
and showed that distributed representations can help understanding emoji semantics in everyday
usage. The second contribution, closest to ours, trained emoji embeddings from a large Twitter
dataset of over 100 million English tweets using the skip-gram method. These pre-trained emoji
representations led to increased accuracy on a similarity task, and a meaningful clustering of the
emoji embedding space. While this method is able to learn robust representations for frequently-used
emojis, representations of less frequent emojis are estimated rather poorly or not available at all. In
fact, only around 700 emojis can be found in this corpus, while there is support of over 1600 emojis
in the Unicode standard.
The approach differs in two important aspects. First, since the representation of emojis are estimated
directly from their description, robust representations are obtained for all supported emoji symbols —
even the long tail of infrequently used ones. Secondly, the method works with much less data. Instead
of training on millions of tweets, the representations are trained on only a few thousand descriptions.
Still, higher accuracy results are obtained on a Twitter sentiment analysis task.
In addition, the work relates to building word representations for words and concepts based on their
description in a dictionary. Similarly to their approach, representations are build for emojis based on
their descriptions and keyword phrases.
Some of the limitations are evident in the work who showed that different cultural phenomena and
languages may co-opt conventional emoji sentiment. Since training is only on English-language
definitions and ignore temporal definitions of emojis, the training method might not capture the full
semantic characteristics of an emoji.
3
Methodology
The method maps emoji symbols into the same space as the 300-dimensional Google News word2vec
embeddings. Thus, the resulting emoji2vec embeddings can be used in addition to 300-dimensional
word2vec embeddings in any application. To this end emojis, their name and their keyword phrases
are crawled from the Unicode emoji list, resulting in 6088 descriptions of 1661 emoji symbols.
3.1
Model
Emoji embeddings are trained using a simple method. For every training example consisting of an
emoji and a sequence of words w1, ..., wN describing that emoji, we take the sum of the individual
word vectors in the descriptive phrase as found in the Google News word2vec embeddings
v =
N
X
k=1
wk,
(1)
where wk is the word2vec vector for word wk if that vector exists (otherwise we drop the summand)
and vj is the vector representation of the description. A trainable vector xi for every emoji in
our training set is defined, and the probability of a match between the emoji representation xi
and its description representation vj is modeled using the sigmoid of the dot product of the two
representations σ(xT
i vj). For training we use the logistic loss
L(i, j, yij) = −log(σ(yijxT
i vj −(1 −yij)xT
i vj))
(2)
where yij is 1 if description j is valid for emoji i and 0 otherwise.
3.2
Optimization
The model is implemented in TensorFlow and optimized using stochastic gradient descent with Adam
as optimizer. As we do not observe any negative training examples (invalid descriptions of emojis do
2
not appear in the original training set), to increase generalization performance we randomly sample
descriptions for emojis as negative instances (i.e. induce a mismatched description). One of the
parameters of our model is the ratio of negative samples to positive samples; we found that having
one positive example per negative example produced the best results. We perform early-stopping on
a held-out development set and found 80 epochs of training to give the best results. As we are only
training on emoji descriptions and our method is simple and cheap, training takes less than 3 minutes
on a 2013 MacBook Pro.
4
Experiments
The approach is quantitatively evaluated on an intrinsic (emoji-description classification) and extrinsic
(Twitter sentiment analysis) task. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis is given by visualizing the
learned emoji embedding space and investigating emoji analogy examples.
4.1
Emoji-Description Classification
To analyze how well the method models the distribution of correct emoji descriptions, a manually-
labeled test set containing pairs of emojis and phrases, as well as a correspondence label was created.
For instance, the test set includes the example: , ""crying"", True, as well as the example , ""fish"", False.
σ(xT
i vi) is calculated for each example in the test set, measuring the similarity between the emoji
vector and the sum of word vectors in the phrase.
When a classifier thresholds the above prediction at 0.5 to determine a positive or negative correlation,
an accuracy of 85.5% is obtained for classifying whether an emoji-description pair is valid or not.
By varying the threshold used for this classifier, a receiver operating characteristic curve with an
area-under-the-curve of 0.933 is obtained, which demonstrates that high quality of the learned emoji
representations.
4.2
Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
As downstream task the accuracy of sentiment classification of tweets for various classifiers with three
different sets of pre-trained word embeddings are compared: (1) the original Google News word2vec
embeddings, (2) word2vec augmented with emoji embeddings trained by skip-gram model, and (3)
word2vec augmented with emoji2vec trained from Unicode descriptions. A dataset is used which
consists of over 67k English tweets labelled manually for positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
In both the training set and the test set, 46% of tweets are labeled neutral, 29% are labeled positive,
and 25% are labeled negative. To compute the feature vectors for training, we summed the vectors
corresponding to each word or emoji in the text of the Tweet. The goal of this simple sentiment
analysis model is not to produce state-of-the-art results in sentiment analysis; it is simply to show that
including emojis adds discriminating information to a model, which could potentially be exploited in
more advanced social NLP systems.
Because the labels are rather evenly distributed, accuracy is an effective metric in determining
performance on this classification task. Results are reported in Table 1. Augmenting word2vec
with emoji embeddings improves overall classification accuracy on the full corpus, and substantially
improves classification performance for tweets that contain emojis. It suggests that emoji embeddings
could improve performance for other social NLP tasks as well. Furthermore, emoji2vec generally
outperforms the emoji embeddings trained by the skip-gram model, despite being trained on much
less data using a simple model.
4.3
Analogy Task
A well-known property of word2vec is that embeddings trained with this method to some extent
capture meaningful linear relationships between words directly in the vector space. For instance, it
holds that the vector representation of ’king’ minus ’man’ plus ’woman’ is closest to ’queen’. Word
embeddings have commonly been evaluated on such word analogy tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult
to build such an analogy task for emojis due to the small number and semantically distinct categories
of emojis. Nevertheless, a few intuitive examples were collected. For every query the closest five

Conclusion
Since existing pre-trained word embeddings such as Google News word2vec embeddings or GloVe
fail to provide emoji embeddings, emoji2vec — embeddings of 1661 emoji symbols were released.
Instead of running word2vec’s skip-gram model on a large collection of emojis and their contexts
appearing in tweets, emoji2vec is directly trained on Unicode descriptions of emojis. The resulting
emoji embeddings can be used to augment any downstream task that currently uses word2vec
embeddings, and might prove especially useful in social NLP tasks where emojis are used frequently
(e.g. Twitter, Instagram, etc.). Despite the fact that the model is simpler and trained on much less
data, it outperforms the skip-gram model on the task of Twitter sentiment analysis.
As the approach directly works on Unicode descriptions, it is not restricted to emoji symbols. In
the future the usefulness of the method for other Unicode symbol embeddings will be investigated.
Furthermore, plans are made to improve emoji2vec in the future by also reading full text emoji
descriptions and using a recurrent neural network instead of a bag-of-word-vectors approach for
enocoding descriptions. In addition, since the approach does not capture the context-dependent
definitions of emojis (such as sarcasm, or appropriation via other cultural phenomena), mechanisms
will be explored to efficiently capturing these nuanced meanings.

P133.pdf,"Discontinuous Constituent Parsing as Sequence
Labeling
Abstract
This paper reduces discontinuous parsing to sequence labeling. It first shows that
existing reductions for constituent parsing as labeling do not support discontinuities.
Second, it fills this gap and proposes to encode tree discontinuities as nearly ordered
permutations of the input sequence. Third, it studies whether such discontinuous
representations are learnable. The experiments show that despite the architectural
simplicity, under the right representation, the models are fast and accurate.
1
Introduction
Discontinuous constituent parsing studies how to generate phrase-structure trees of sentences coming
from non-configurational languages, where non-consecutive tokens can be part of the same grammati-
cal function (e.g. nonconsecutive terms belonging to the same verb phrase). Figure 1 shows a German
sentence exhibiting this phenomenon. Discontinuities happen in languages that exhibit free word
order such as German or Guugu Yimidhirr, but also in those with high rigidity, e.g. English, whose
grammar allows certain discontinuous expressions, such as wh-movement or extraposition. This
makes discontinuous parsing a core computational linguistics problem that affects a wide spectrum
of languages.
There are different paradigms for discontinuous phrase-structure parsing, such as chart-based parsers,
transitionbased algorithms or reductions to a problem of a different nature, such as dependency
parsing. However, many of these approaches come either at a high complexity or low
speed, while others give up significant performance to achieve an acceptable latency.
Related to these research aspects, this work explores the feasibility of discontinuous parsing under
the sequence labeling paradigm, inspired by work on fast and simple continuous constituent parsing.
We will focus on tackling the limitations of their encoding functions when it comes to analyzing
discontinuous structures, and include an empirical comparison against existing parsers.
Contribution (i) The first contribution is theoretical: to reduce constituent parsing of free word order
languages to a sequence labeling problem. This is done by encoding the order of the sentence as
(nearly ordered) permutations. We present various ways of doing so, which can be naturally combined
with the labels produced by existing reductions for continuous constituent parsing. (ii) The second
contribution is a practical one: to show how these representations can be learned by neural transducers.
We also shed light on whether general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks can effectively parse
free word order languages, and be used as an alternative to adhoc algorithms and architectures for
discontinuous constituent parsing.

Related work
Discontinuous phrase-structure trees can be derived by expressive formalisms such as Multiple
Context Free Grammmars (MCFGs) or Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS). MCFGs
and LCFRS are essentially an extension of Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) such that non-terminals
can link to non-consecutive spans. Traditionally, chart-based parsers relying on this paradigm
commonly suffer from high complexity. Let k be the block degree, i.e. the number of nonconsecutive
spans than can be attached to a single non-terminal; the complexity of applying CYK (after binarizing
the grammar) would be O(n3k), which can be improved to O(n2k+2) if the parser is restricted to
well-nested LCFRS, and discusses how for a standard discontinuous treebank, k 3 (in contrast to
k = 1 in CFGs). Recently, presents a chart-based parser for k = 2 that can run in O(n3), which is
equivalent to the running time of a continuous chart parser, while covering 98
Differently, it is possible to rely on the idea that discontinuities are inherently related to the location
of the token in the sentence. In this sense, it is possible to reorder the tokens while still obtaining a
grammatical sentence that could be parsed by a continuous algorithm. This is usually achieved with
transition-based parsing algorithms and the swap transition which switches the topmost elements in
the stack. For instance, uses this transition to adapt an easy-first strategy for dependency parsing to
discontinuous constituent parsing. In a similar vein, builds on top of a fast continuous shift-reduce
constituent parser, and incorporates both standard and bundled swap transitions in order to analyze
discontinuous constituents. system produces derivations of up to a length of n2 n + 1 given a
sentence of length n. More efficiently, presents a transition system which replaces swap with a gap
transition. The intuition is that a reduction does not need to be always applied locally to the two
topmost elements in the stack, and that those two items can be connected, despite the existence of a
gap between them, using non-local reductions. Their algorithm ensures an upper-bound of n(n1)2
transitions. With a different optimization goal, removed the traditional reliance of discontinuous
parsers on averaged perceptrons and hand-crafted features for a recursive neural network approach
that guides a swap-based system, with the capacity to generate contextualized representations. replace
the stack used in transition-based systems with a memory set containing the created constituents.
This model allows interactions between elements that are not adjacent, without the swap transition, to
create a new (discontinuous) constituent. Trained on a 2 stacked BiLSTM transducer, the model is
guaranteed to build a tree with in 4n-2 transitions, given a sentence of length n.
A middle ground between explicit constituent parsing algorithms and this paper is the work based on
transformations. For instance, convert constituent trees into a nonlinguistic dependency representation
that is learned by a transition-based dependency parser, to then map its output back to a constituent tree.
A similar approach is taken by, but they proposed a more compact representation that leads to a much
reduced set of output labels. Other authors such as propose a two-step approach that approximates
discontinuous structure trees by parsing context-free grammars with generative probabilistic models
and transforming them to discontinuous ones. cast discontinuous phrase-structure parsing into a
framework that jointly performs supertagging and non-projective dependency parsing by a reduction
to the Generalized Maximum Spanning Arborescence problem. The recent work by can be also
framed within this paradigm. They essentially adapt the work by and replace the averaged perceptron
classifier with pointer networks, adressing
In this context, the closest work to ours is the reduction proposed by, who cast continuous constituent
parsing as sequence labeling. In the next sections we build on top of their work and: (i) analyze why
their approach cannot handle discontinuous phrases, (ii) extend it to handle such phenomena, and (iii)
train functional sequence labeling discontinuous parsers.

Preliminaries
Let w = [w0, w1, ..., w|w|1] be an input sequence of tokens, and T|w| the set of (continuous)
constituent trees for sequences of length |w|; define an encoding function : T|w| →L|w| to map
continuous constituent trees into a sequence of labels of the same length as the input. Each label, li
L, is composed of three components li = (ni, xi, ui):
• ni encodes the number of levels in the tree in common between a word wi and wi+1. To obtain a
manageable output vocabulary space, ni is actually encoded as the difference ni ni1, with n1 = 0. We
denote by abs(ni) the absolute number of levels represented by ni. i.e. the total levels in common
shared between a word and its next one.
• xi represents the lowest non-terminal symbol shared between wi and wi+1 at level abs(ni).
• ui encodes a leaf unary chain, i.e. nonterminals that belong only to the path from the terminal wi to
the root. Note that cannot encode this information in (ni, xi), as these components always represent
common information between wi and wi+1.
2
Incompleteness for discontinuous phrase structures proved that is complete and injective for continu-
ous trees. However, it is easy to prove that its validity does not extend to discontinuous trees, by using
a counterexample. Figure 3 shows a minimal discontinuous tree that cannot be correctly decoded.
The inability to encode discontinuities lies on the assumption that wi+1 will always be attached to a
node belonging to the path from the root to wi (ni is then used to specify the location of that node in
the path). This is always true in continuous trees, but not in discontinuous trees, as can be seen in
Figure 3 where c is the child of a constituent that does not lie in the path from S to b.

Encoding nearly ordered permutations
Next, we fill this gap to address discontinuous parsing as sequence labeling. We will extend the
encoding to the set of discontinuous constituent trees, which we will call T|w|. The key to do this
relies on a well-known property: a discontinuous tree t T|w| can be represented as a continuous one
using an in-order traversal that keeps track of the original indexes (e.g. the trees at the left and the
right in Figure 4). We will call this tree the (canonical) continuous arrangement of t, (t) T|w|.
Thus, if given an input sentence we can generate the position of every word as a terminal in (t), the
existing encodings to predict continuous trees as sequence labeling could be applied on (t). In essence,
this is learning to predict a permutation of w. As introduced in §2, the concept of location of a token
is not a stranger in transition-based discontinuous parsing, where actions such as swap switch the
position of two elements in order to create a discontinuous phrase. We instead propose to explore
how to handle this problem in end-to-end sequence labeling fashion, without relying on any parsing
structure nor a set of transitions.
Todo so, first we denote by τ : {0, . . . , |w| −1} →{0, . . . , |w| −1} the permutation that maps the
position i of a given wi in w into its position as a terminal node in ω(t). From this, one can derive
τ −1, a function that encodes a permutation of w in such a way that its phrase structure does not have
crossing branches. For continuous trees, τ and τ −1 are identity permutations. Then, we extend the
tree encoding function Φ to T|w| →L′
|w| where l ∈L′ is enriched with a fourth component pi such
that l = (ni, xi, ui, pi), where pi is a discrete symbol such that the sequence of pi’s encodes the
permutation τ (typically, each pi will be an encoding of τ(i), i.e., the position of wi in the continuous
arrangement, although this need not be true in all encodings, as will be seen below).
The crux of defining a viable encoding for discontinuous parsing is then in how we encode tau as
a sequence of values pi, for i = 0 . . . |w| 1. While the naive approach would be the identity
encoding (pi = tau(i)), we ideally want an encoding that balances minimizing sparsity (by minimizing
infrequently-used values) and maximizing learnability (by being predictable). To do so, we will look
for encodings that take advantage of the fact that discontinuities in attested syntactic structures are
mild , i.e., in most cases, tau (i + 1) = tau (i) + 1. In other words, permutations tau corresponding to
real syntactic trees tend to be nearly ordered permutations. Based on these principles, we propose
below a set of concrete encodings, which are also depicted on an example in Figure 4. All of them
handle multiple gaps (a discontinuity inside a discontinuity) and cover 100
Absolute-position: For every token wi, pi = τ(i) only if wi ̸= τ(i). Otherwise, we use a special
label INV, which represents that the word is a fixed point in the permutation, i.e., it occupies the same
place in the sentence and in the continuous arrangement.
Relative-position If i != tau(i), then pi = i tau(i). otherwise, we again use the INV label.
Lehmer code In combinatorics, let n = [0, ..., n 1] be a sorted sequence of objects, a Lehmer code
is a sequence sigma = [sigma0, ...sigman1] that encodes one of the n! permutations of n, namely .
The idea is intuitive: let ni+1 be the subsequence of objects from n that remain available after we
have permuted the first i objects to achieve the permutation , then sigmai+1 equals the (zero-based)
position in ni+1 of the next object to be selected. For instance, given n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and a valid
permutation = [0, 1, 3, 4, 2], then sigma = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Note that the identity permutation would be
encoded as a sequence of zeros.
In the context of discontinuous parsing and encoding pi, n can be seen as the input sentence w
where pi(w) is encoded by sigma. The Lehmer code is particularly suitable for this task in terms
of compression, as in most of the cases we expect (nearly) ordered permutations, which translates
into the majority of elements of sigma being zero. However, this encoding poses some potential

learnability problems. The root of the problem is that sigmai does not necessarily encode tau(i), but
tau(j) where j is the index of the word that occupies the ith position in the continuous arrangement
(i.e., j = tau 1(i)). In other words, this encoding is expressed following the order of words in the
continuous arrangement rather than the input order, causing a non-straightforward mapping between
input words and labels. For instance, in the previous example, sigma2 does not encode the location of
the object n2 = 2 but that of n3 = 3.

pi as meaning that should fill the (pi + 1)th currently remaining blank in a sequence sigma that is
initialized as a sequence of blanks, i.e. sigma = [,,...,] .Forinstance, letn = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]be

Finally, in Table 11 we list the number of parameters for each of the transducers trained on the pointer-
based encoding. For the rest of the encodings, the models have a similar number of parameters, as the
only change in the architecture is the small part involving the feed-forward output layer that predicts
the label component pi.
More in detail, for BiLSTMs and vanilla Trans-
formers, the word embeddings are pre-trained FastText embeddings with 100 dimensions for English
and 60 for German, and the PoS tags are represented by an embedding layer of 20 dimensions.

cross entropy as the loss function. The learning rate and other hyper-parameters are left as default
in the transformers library, except for the number of training epochs (we train them for at most 30
epochs), and the batch size, which is adjusted depending on the memory required by the model (e.g. 8
for BERT and 32 for DistilBERT). For the BERT-large model, due to the limitations in GPU memory,
we have to reduce the training batch size to 1, and use a smaller learning rate of 1e-5.

5.1
Results
Table 2 shows the results on the dev sets for all encodings and transducers. The tendency is clear
showing that the pointer-based encodings obtain the best results. The pointer-based encoding with
simplified PoS tags does not lead however to clear improvements, suggesting that the models can learn
the sparser original PoS tags set. For the rest of encodings we also observe interesting tendencies. For
instance, when running experiments using stacked BiLSTMs, the relative encoding performs better
5
than the absolute one, which was somehow expected as the encoding is less sparse. However, the
tendency is the opposite for the Transformer encoders (including BERT and DistilBERT), especially
for the case of discontinuous constituents. We hypothesize this is due to the capacity of Transformers
to attend to every other word through multihead attention, which might give an advantage to encode
absolute positions over BiLSTMs, where the whole left and right context is represented by a single
vector. With respect to the Lehmer and Lehmer of the inverse permutation encodings, the latter
performs better overall, confirming the bigger difficulties for the tested sequence labelers to learn
Lehmer, which in some cases has a performance even close to the naive absolute-positional encoding
(e.g. for TIGER using the vanilla Transformer encoder and BERT). As introduced in §4, we
hypothesize this is caused by the non-straightforward mapping between words and labels (in the
Lehmer code the label generated for a word does not necessarily contain information about the
position of such word in the continuous arrangement).
In Table 3 we compare a selection of our models against previous work using both gold and predicted
PoS tags. In particular, we include: (i) models using the pointer-based encoding, since they obtained
the overall best performance on the dev sets, and (ii) a representative subset of encodings (the absolute
positional one and the Lehmer code of the inverse permutation) trained with the best performing
transducer. Additionally, for the case of the (English) DPTB, we also include experiments using a
bert-large model, to shed more light on whether the size of the networks is playing a role when it
comes to detect discontinuities. Additionally, we report speeds on CPU and GPU. The experiments
show that the encodings are learnable, but that the model’s power makes a difference. For instance, in
the predicted setup BILSTMs and vanilla Transformers perform in line with predeep learning models
, DistilBERT already achieves a robust performance, close to models such as and BERT transducers
suffice to achieve results close to some of the strongest approaches, e.g.. Yet, the results lag behind
the state of the art. With respect to the architectures that performed the best the main issue is that
they are the bottleneck of the pipeline. Thus, the computation of the contextualized word vectors
under current approaches greatly decreases the importance, when it comes to speed, of the chosen
parsing paradigm used to generate the output trees (e.g. chart-based versus sequence labeling).
Finally, Table 4 details the discontinuous performance of our best performing models.
Discussion on other applications It is worth noting that while we focused on parsing as sequence
labeling, encoding syntactic trees as labels is useful to straightforwardly feed syntactic information
to downstream models, even if the trees themselves come from a non-sequence-labeling parser. For
example, use the sequence labeling encoding of to provide syntactic information to a semantic role
labeling model. Apart from providing fast and accurate parsers, our encodings can be used to do the
same with discontinuous syntax.
6
Conclusion
We reduced discontinuous parsing to sequence labeling. The key contribution consisted in predicting
a continuous tree with a rearrangement of the leaf nodes to shape discontinuities, and defining
various ways to encode such a rearrangement as a sequence of labels associated to each word, taking
advantage of the fact that in practice they are nearly ordered permutations. We tested whether those
encodings are learnable by neural models and saw that the choice of permutation encoding is not
trivial, and there are interactions between encodings

P099.pdf,"Enhancing LSTM-based Video Narration Through
Text-Derived Linguistic Insights
Abstract
This study delves into how linguistic understanding, extracted from extensive text
datasets, can be leveraged to enhance the generation of natural language video
descriptions. Specifically, we integrate both a neural language model and distribu-
tional semantics, trained on large text corpora, into a contemporary LSTM-based
framework for video description. Our evaluation, conducted on a collection of
YouTube videos and two substantial movie description datasets, reveals consider-
able advancements in grammatical correctness, accompanied by subtle improve-
ments in descriptive quality.
1
Introduction
The capacity to automatically generate natural language (NL) descriptions for videos has numerous
significant applications, such as content-based video retrieval and aiding visually impaired individuals.
Recent effective approaches, use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), treating the problem as a machine
translation (MT) task, converting from video to natural language. Deep learning methods like RNNs
require extensive training data; however, there’s a shortage of high-quality video-sentence pairs.
Conversely, vast raw text datasets are readily available, exhibiting rich linguistic structure useful
for video description. Most work in statistical MT employs a language model, trained on extensive
monolingual target language data, and a translation model, trained on restricted parallel bilingual
data. This paper investigates methods to incorporate knowledge from language datasets to capture
general linguistic patterns to improve video description.
This study integrates linguistic data into a video-captioning model based on Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) RNNs, known for state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, LSTMs function effectively
as language models (LMs). Our initial method (early fusion) involves pre-training the network
using plain text prior to training with parallel video-text datasets. Our subsequent two methods,
influenced by current MT research, incorporate an LSTM LM with the existing video-to-text model.
Furthermore, we explore substituting the standard one-hot word encoding with distributional vectors
derived from external datasets.
We present thorough comparisons across these methods, assessing them on a typical YouTube corpus
and two recently released extensive movie description datasets. The findings indicate notable gains in
description grammaticality (as assessed by crowdsourced human evaluations) and moderate gains in
descriptive quality (as determined by human judgements and automated comparisons against human-
generated descriptions). Our main contributions include: (1) numerous approaches to integrate
knowledge from external text into a current captioning model, (2) comprehensive experiments
comparing methods on three large video-caption datasets, and (3) human assessments demonstrating
that external linguistic knowledge notably impacts grammar.
2
LSTM-based Video Description
We employ the S2VT video description framework, which we describe briefly here. S2VT adopts a
sequence-to-sequence approach that maps an input video frame feature sequence to a fixed-dimension
vector, which is then decoded into a sequence of output words.
As depicted in the architecture employs a dual-layered LSTM network. The input to the initial LSTM
layer is a sequence of frame features extracted from the second-to-last layer (fc7) of a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) after the ReLU operation. This LSTM layer encodes the video sequence. At
each step, the hidden state is fed into the subsequent LSTM layer. Following the processing of all
frames, the second LSTM layer is trained to transform this state into a sequence of words. This can be
thought of as using one LSTM to model visual features and another to model language, conditioned
on the visual data. We modify this structure to incorporate linguistic information during training and
generation. Although our techniques are based on S2VT, they are sufficiently general and could be
applied to other CNN-RNN based captioning models.
3
Approach
Current visual captioning models are trained solely on text from the caption datasets and display some
linguistic anomalies stemming from a limited language model and vocabulary. Here, we explore
several methods to integrate prior linguistic knowledge into a CNN/LSTM network for video-to-text
(S2VT) and assess how well they improve overall description quality.
3.1
Early Fusion
Our early fusion method involves initially pre-training the language-modeling components of the
network on large raw NL text datasets, before fine-tuning these parameters on video-text paired
datasets. An LSTM model can learn the probability of an output sequence given an input. To learn a
language model, we train the LSTM layer to predict the next word based on the preceding words.
Following the S2VT design, we embed one-hot encoded words into reduced-dimension vectors. The
network is trained on extensive text datasets, and its parameters are learned using backpropagation
with stochastic gradient descent. The weights from this network initialize the embedding and weights
of the LSTM layers in S2VT, which is then trained on video-text data. This trained LM is also utilized
as the LSTM LM in both late and deep fusion models.
3.2
Late Fusion
Our late fusion approach draws inspiration from how neural machine translation models incorporate
a trained language model during decoding. At each step of sentence generation, the video caption
model generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary. We then utilize the language model
to re-score the final output by considering a weighted average of the scores from the LM and the
S2VT video-description model (VM). Specifically, for output at time step ’t’, and given proposal
distributions from the video captioning model and the language model, we can calculate the re-scored
probability of each new word as:
p(yt = y) = α · pV M(yt = y) + (1 −α) · pLM(yt = y)
(1)
The hyper-parameter is tuned on the validation set.
3.3
Deep Fusion
In the deep fusion approach, we integrate the LM more profoundly in the generation process. We
achieve this by concatenating the hidden state of the language model LSTM (hLM) with the hidden
state of the S2VT video description model (hV M) and use the resulting combined latent vector to
predict the output word. This is similar to the method employed to incorporate language models
from monolingual data for machine translation. However, our method differs in two ways: (1) We
concatenate only the hidden states of the S2VT LSTM and language LSTM, without additional
context. (2) We keep the weights of the LSTM language model constant while training the entire
video captioning network. The probability of a predicted word at time step t is:
p(yt|G<t, T) ∝exp(WE(hV
t ⊕WT hLM
t
) + b)
(2)
2
where V is the visual feature input, W represents the weight matrix, and b stands for biases. We
avoid fine-tuning the LSTM LM to avoid overwriting previously learned weights of a strong language
model. However, the full video caption model is trained to integrate LM outputs while being trained
on captioning data.
3.4
Distributional Word Representations
The S2VT network, like many image and video captioning models, uses a one-hot encoding for
words. During training, the model learns to embed these one-hot words into a 500-dimensional
space via linear transformation. This embedding, however, is learned from the limited and possibly
noisy caption data. Many techniques exist that leverage large text datasets to learn vector-space
representations of words, capturing nuanced semantic and syntactic structures. We aim to capitalize
on these to enhance video description. Specifically, we replace the embedding matrix from one-hot
vectors with 300-dimensional GloVe vectors, pre-trained on 6B tokens from Gigaword and Wikipedia
2014. We further explore variations where the model predicts both the one-hot word (softmax loss)
and the distributional vector from the LSTM hidden state using Euclidean loss. The output vector (yt)
is computed as yt = (Wght + bg), and the loss is:
L(yt, wglove) = ||(Wght + bg) −wglove||2
(3)
where ht is the LSTM output, wglove is the GloVe embedding, and W and b are weights and biases.
The network becomes a multi-task model with dual loss functions, which we use to influence weight
learning.
3.5
Ensembling
The loss function of the video-caption network is non-convex and hard to optimize. In practice, using
an ensemble of trained networks can improve performance. We also present results of an ensemble
created by averaging predictions from the highest performing models.

Experiments
4.1
Datasets
Our language model was trained using sentences from Gigaword, BNC, UkWaC, and Wikipedia.
The vocabulary contained the 72,700 most frequent tokens, also including GloVe embeddings.
Following evaluation we compare our models on the YouTube dataset, along with two extensive
movie description datasets: MPII-MD and M-VAD.
4.2
Evaluation Metrics
We assess performance using machine translation metrics, METEOR and BLEU, to compare model-
generated descriptions with human-written descriptions. For movie datasets with a single description,
we use only METEOR, as it is more robust.
4.3
Human Evaluation
We also collect human judgments on a random subset of 200 video clips for each dataset through
Amazon Turk. Each sentence was evaluated by three workers on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (higher is
better) for relevance and grammar. Grammar evaluations were done without viewing videos. Movie
evaluation focused solely on grammar due to copyright.
4.4
YouTube Video Dataset Results
The results show Deep Fusion performed well for both METEOR and BLEU scores. The integration
of Glove embeddings considerably increased METEOR, and combining both techniques performed
best. Our final model is an ensemble (weighted average) of the Glove model and two Glove+Deep
Fusion models trained on external and in-domain COCO sentences. While the state-of-the-art on this
dataset is achieved using attention to encode the video our work focuses on language modeling.

Related Work
Following the advancements of LSTM-based models in Machine Translation and image captioning,
video description works propose CNN-RNN models that create a vector representation of the video,
which is decoded by an LSTM sequence model to generate a description. Some works also incorporate
external data to improve video description, however, our focus is on integrating external linguistic
knowledge for video captioning. We explore the use of distributional semantic embeddings and
LSTM-based language models trained on external text datasets.
LSTMs have proven to be effective language models. Other works have developed an LSTM model
for machine translation that incorporates a monolingual language model for the target language,
achieving improved results. We utilize similar techniques (late fusion, deep fusion) to train an LSTM
for video-to-text translation. This model uses large monolingual datasets to enhance RNN-based
video description networks. Unlike other approaches where the monolingual LM is used solely for
parameter tuning, our approach utilizes the output of the language model as an input for training the
full underlying video description network.
4
Other recent works propose video description models that focus primarily on improving the video
representation itself with hierarchical visual pipelines and attention mechanisms. Without the attention
mechanism their models achieve good METEOR scores on the YouTube dataset. The interesting
aspect is that the contribution of language alone is considerable. Hence, it is important to focus on
both aspects to generate better descriptions.
6
Conclusion
This study investigates methods to integrate linguistic knowledge from text datasets for video
captioning. Our assessments on YouTube videos and two movie description datasets show improved
results according to human evaluations of grammar while also modestly improving the descriptive
quality of sentences. Although the proposed methods are assessed on a particular video-captioning
network, they are applicable to other video and image captioning models.

P107.pdf,"Neural Approaches to Real-Time Weather Forecasting:
Unlocking the Potential of Artificial Intelligence in
Meteorology
Abstract
The pursuit of accurate and efficient real-time weather forecasting has been a
longstanding endeavor, with recent advancements in neural networks and deep
learning techniques offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation in this field.
By leveraging the complex patterns and relationships inherent in meteorological
data, neural approaches can potentially revolutionize the way we predict and
prepare for various weather phenomena. Furthermore, the integration of neural
networks with traditional forecasting methods can lead to the development of hybrid
models that capitalize on the strengths of both paradigms, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts.
In addition to exploring the applications of well-established neural architectures,
such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, in the context
of weather forecasting, our research also delves into the realm of more unconven-
tional approaches. For instance, we investigate the potential benefits of utilizing
neural networks that are trained on datasets comprised of fractal patterns and chaos
theory principles, with the aim of capturing the intricate and often unpredictable
nature of atmospheric dynamics. Moreover, we examine the feasibility of employ-
ing neural networks that are capable of learning from non-traditional data sources,
such as social media posts and crowdsourced weather reports, in order to gather
more diverse and comprehensive information about current weather conditions.
1
Introduction
The pursuit of accurate and efficient weather forecasting has been a longstanding endeavor, with
significant advancements in recent years owing to the integration of neural network architectures.
These complex systems, inspired by the human brain’s neural structure, have demonstrated unparal-
leled capabilities in pattern recognition and predictive modeling, making them an ideal candidate
for tackling the intricate and dynamic nature of atmospheric phenomena. The application of neural
approaches to real-time weather forecasting has opened up new avenues for improving forecast
accuracy, reducing latency, and enhancing the overall reliability of weather prediction systems.
Historically, weather forecasting relied heavily on physical models that simulated the behavior of
the atmosphere based on governing laws of physics and thermodynamics. While these models have
provided a foundation for understanding and predicting weather patterns, they are often limited
by their complexity, computational intensity, and the need for high-quality initial and boundary
conditions. The advent of neural networks has introduced a paradigm shift, allowing for the direct
learning of patterns from large datasets, thereby bypassing the need for explicit physical formulations.
This data-driven approach has shown promising results, particularly in forecasting phenomena that
are difficult to model using traditional methods, such as precipitation patterns, storm tracks, and
temperature fluctuations.
One of the more unconventional approaches to neural weather forecasting involves the use of
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic weather patterns that can be used to
augment real-world datasets, thereby enhancing model training and improving forecast accuracy. This
method, while unorthodox, leverages the adversarial process between generator and discriminator
networks to produce highly realistic weather scenarios, including extreme events that are rare in
historical records but crucial for robust forecasting models. Furthermore, the integration of chaotic
theory principles into neural network design has been explored, with some researchers proposing that
the inherent chaos in weather systems can be harnessed to improve predictive capabilities. This line
of inquiry, though speculative, suggests that embracing the chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics
rather than trying to tame it could lead to breakthroughs in forecast reliability and precision.
The inclusion of social media and crowd-sourced data as additional layers of information for neural
weather forecasting models represents another innovative, albeit somewhat untested, approach. The
rationale behind this method is that real-time reports from individuals can provide ground truth data
on weather conditions, serving as a complementary or even primary source of information in areas
where traditional observation networks are sparse or nonexistent. While concerns regarding data
quality, reliability, and potential biases are valid, proponents argue that the sheer volume and diversity
of social media data could offset these drawbacks, offering a unique opportunity for models to learn
from a broader spectrum of experiences and observations.
In a departure from conventional wisdom, some researchers have explored the application of neural
networks to forecast weather patterns based on astrological principles, arguing that celestial bodies
and their positions could exert a previously unrecognized influence on atmospheric conditions. This
esoteric approach, though dismissed by many as lacking a scientific basis, has surprisingly yielded
some intriguing results, with certain models appearing to capture subtle patterns in weather data
that correlate with planetary alignments and lunar cycles. While these findings are preliminary and
require rigorous validation, they underscore the creativity and open-mindedness that characterize the
current landscape of neural weather forecasting research.
The rise of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) has also played a significant role in the
development of real-time weather forecasting systems, enabling the deployment of neural networks
on remote devices and sensors. This distributed architecture allows for the processing of weather
data closer to its source, reducing latency and enhancing the responsiveness of forecasting models.
Moreover, the proliferation of low-cost, high-performance computing platforms has democratized
access to neural network development, fostering a community-driven approach to weather forecasting
where individuals and organizations can contribute their expertise and resources to improve collective
predictive capabilities.
Despite the strides made in neural approaches to weather forecasting, numerous challenges persist,
including the need for better understanding and mitigation of model biases, the development of more
efficient training algorithms, and the integration of multimodal data sources to enhance forecast
accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the interpretability of neural network models remains a
pressing concern, as the complex, nonlinear relationships learned by these models often obfuscate
the underlying decision-making processes, making it difficult to discern the physical and dynamical
principles that underpin their predictions. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the
continued advancement of neural weather forecasting, necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration
and innovation at the intersection of atmospheric science, computer science, and engineering.
In conclusion, the field of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting is characterized
by a vibrant diversity of ideas, methodologies, and applications, reflecting the complexity and
multifaceted nature of atmospheric phenomena. From the application of state-of-the-art neural
network architectures to the exploration of unconventional data sources and forecasting principles,
researchers are continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in weather prediction, driven
by the ultimate goal of providing accurate, reliable, and timely forecasts that can inform decision-
making and mitigate the impacts of severe weather events. As the field evolves, it is likely that novel,
perhaps unorthodox, approaches will emerge, challenging existing paradigms and contributing to the
development of more sophisticated, effective, and sustainable weather forecasting systems.

Related Work
The realm of real-time weather forecasting has undergone a significant transformation in recent years,
with the advent of neural approaches revolutionizing the way we predict and understand weather
patterns. Traditionally, weather forecasting relied heavily on physical models that utilized complex
2
equations to describe atmospheric conditions, but these models often struggled to capture the inherent
complexities and nuances of the weather. The emergence of neural networks has enabled researchers
to develop more sophisticated and accurate forecasting systems, capable of learning patterns and
relationships within vast amounts of weather data.
One of the earliest neural approaches to weather forecasting involved the use of simple feedforward
networks, which were trained on historical weather data to predict future weather conditions. These
early models demonstrated promising results, but were often limited by their inability to capture
complex spatial and temporal relationships within the data. To address this limitation, researchers
began exploring the use of more advanced neural architectures, such as recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly well-suited for modeling
sequential and spatial data.
RNNs, for example, have been used to model the temporal dynamics of weather patterns, allowing
researchers to predict future weather conditions based on historical trends and patterns. These
models have been shown to be particularly effective in predicting short-term weather patterns, such as
hourly temperature and precipitation forecasts. CNNs, on the other hand, have been used to analyze
spatial patterns in weather data, such as cloud formations and atmospheric circulation patterns.
By combining these two architectures, researchers have been able to develop more comprehensive
forecasting systems that capture both the spatial and temporal complexities of the weather.
In addition to these traditional neural architectures, researchers have also begun exploring more
unconventional approaches to weather forecasting. For example, some studies have investigated
the use of neural networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of social media posts and
online search queries. The idea behind this approach is that certain keywords and phrases may be
indicative of weather-related events, such as tweets about heavy rainfall or Facebook posts about
extreme heat. By analyzing these online trends, researchers believe that they can gain insights into
emerging weather patterns and make more accurate forecasts.
Another unusual approach to weather forecasting involves the use of neural networks to analyze
the sounds of nature, such as bird songs and ocean waves. The idea behind this approach is that
these natural sounds may contain hidden patterns and frequencies that are related to weather patterns.
For example, researchers have found that the songs of certain bird species may change in response
to changes in temperature and humidity, while the sounds of ocean waves may be influenced by
wind patterns and sea state. By analyzing these natural sounds using neural networks, researchers
believe that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate
relationships between the natural world and the weather.
Furthermore, some researchers have even explored the use of neural networks to predict weather
patterns based on analysis of art and music. The idea behind this approach is that certain artistic and
musical themes may be reflective of weather-related moods and emotions, such as the use of stormy
imagery in paintings or the composition of music that evokes feelings of calmness and serenity. By
analyzing these artistic and musical themes using neural networks, researchers believe that they can
gain insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of weather and develop more nuanced
and human-centric forecasting systems.
In a somewhat bizarre twist, some researchers have also investigated the use of neural networks to
predict weather patterns based on analysis of culinary trends and food preferences. The idea behind
this approach is that certain types of cuisine may be more popular during certain types of weather,
such as the consumption of hot and spicy foods during cold weather or the preference for cool and
refreshing foods during hot weather. By analyzing these culinary trends using neural networks,
researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and culturally-sensitive forecasting systems
that capture the complex relationships between food, culture, and weather.
Moreover, the use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context of
chaotic systems and complexity theory. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used
to model and predict the behavior of chaotic systems, such as the atmosphere and oceans, which
are characterized by intricate patterns and feedback loops. By analyzing these complex systems
using neural networks, researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and robust forecasting
systems that capture the inherent uncertainties and unpredictabilities of the weather.
Additionally, the application of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been extended to the
realm of climate modeling and prediction. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and
3
predict long-term climate trends, such as changes in global temperature and sea level rise. These
models have been shown to be particularly effective in capturing the complex relationships between
climate variables and predicting future climate scenarios. By combining these climate models with
traditional weather forecasting systems, researchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive
and integrated forecasting systems that capture both the short-term and long-term aspects of the
weather and climate.
The use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context of ensemble
methods and uncertainty quantification. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used to
generate ensemble forecasts, which involve combining the predictions of multiple models to produce
a single, more accurate forecast. By analyzing the uncertainties and errors associated with each
model, researchers believe that they can develop more robust and reliable forecasting systems that
capture the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the weather.
In another unexpected turn, some researchers have even investigated the use of neural networks to
predict weather patterns based on analysis of dreams and subconscious thoughts. The idea behind
this approach is that certain dreams and subconscious thoughts may be reflective of unconscious
weather-related anxieties and fears, such as the fear of storms or the desire for sunny weather. By
analyzing these dreams and subconscious thoughts using neural networks, researchers believe that
they can gain insights into the psychological and emotional dimensions of weather and develop more
personalized and human-centric forecasting systems.
The application of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been extended to the realm of
urban planning and management. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and predict urban
weather patterns, such as heat islands and air quality, which are critical factors in urban planning and
decision-making. By combining these urban weather models with traditional forecasting systems,
researchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive and integrated forecasting systems
that capture both the local and global aspects of the weather and climate.
Furthermore, the use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context
of sustainability and environmental impact. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used
to analyze and predict the environmental impacts of weather-related events, such as flooding and
droughts. By developing more accurate and robust forecasting systems, researchers believe that they
can help mitigate the negative impacts of these events and promote more sustainable and resilient
communities.
In a somewhat surprising development, some researchers have even investigated the use of neural
networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of fungal growth and mycological trends. The
idea behind this approach is that certain types of fungi may be more prevalent during certain types
of weather, such as the growth of mushrooms during rainy weather or the spread of fungal diseases
during dry weather. By analyzing these mycological trends using neural networks, researchers
believe that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate
relationships between the natural world and the weather.
Overall, the field of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting is rapidly evolving and
expanding, with new and innovative methods being developed and explored. While some of these
approaches may seem unconventional or even bizarre, they reflect the creativity and imagination of
researchers in this field and demonstrate the vast potential of neural networks to revolutionize the
way we understand and predict the weather. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what
is possible with neural networks, we can expect to see even more innovative and effective approaches
to weather forecasting emerge in the future.

Methodology
The development of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting has necessitated a multidisci-
plinary approach, combining advances in computer science, meteorology, and data analysis. At the
core of this endeavor is the creation of complex algorithms that can interpret and predict weather
patterns with high accuracy. To achieve this, we have employed a range of techniques, including
deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), which are particularly adept at analyzing spatial and temporal data respectively.
4
One of the initial steps in our methodology involved the collection and preprocessing of large datasets
related to weather patterns. This included historical weather records from various parts of the globe,
satellite imagery, and data from weather stations. It was crucial to preprocess this data to ensure it
was in a format that could be efficiently analyzed by our neural networks. This involved cleaning the
data to remove any inconsistencies or missing values, normalizing it to prevent features with large
ranges from dominating the model, and transforming it into a suitable format for our neural networks.
Following data preparation, we designed and implemented several neural network architectures. The
first was a CNN-based model aimed at predicting weather patterns from satellite imagery. This
model was trained on a large dataset of satellite images, each labeled with the corresponding weather
conditions. The CNN was able to learn features from these images that were indicative of different
weather patterns, such as cloud formations and atmospheric conditions. This approach showed
promising results, with the model being able to predict weather conditions with a high degree of
accuracy.
In addition to the CNN model, we also developed an RNN-based model to predict weather patterns
over time. This model was trained on historical weather data, including temperature, humidity,
wind speed, and other relevant factors. The RNN was particularly effective at capturing temporal
dependencies in the data, allowing it to make accurate predictions of future weather conditions. This
model was further enhanced by the incorporation of attention mechanisms, which enabled it to focus
on the most relevant input data when making predictions.
However, in an unexpected turn, our research also explored the application of chaotic systems theory
to weather forecasting. By modeling weather patterns as chaotic systems, we were able to identify
certain underlying principles that could be used to make predictions. This involved analyzing the
strange attractors that emerged from the complex interactions within the atmosphere and using these
to forecast future weather patterns. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it yielded some
fascinating results, with certain chaotic models showing a surprising degree of accuracy in their
predictions.
Furthermore, our investigation into neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting took a peculiar
turn when we began to explore the potential of using generative models to create synthetic weather
data. By training generative adversarial networks (GANs) on historical weather data, we were able to
generate new, realistic weather patterns that could be used to augment our training datasets. This not
only helped to increase the diversity of our data but also provided a unique insight into the underlying
structures of weather patterns. The synthetic data generated by the GANs was found to be remarkably
realistic, with some models even producing patterns that had never been observed before in nature.
The integration of these diverse approaches has led to the development of a comprehensive framework
for real-time weather forecasting. By combining the strengths of CNNs, RNNs, chaotic systems
theory, and generative models, we have created a system that is capable of making highly accurate
predictions of weather conditions. This framework is not only robust but also flexible, allowing it
to be adapted to various contexts and regions. Moreover, its ability to learn from experience and
improve over time makes it an invaluable tool for meteorologists and researchers alike.
In another unexpected direction, our research also delved into the realm of quantum computing and
its potential applications to weather forecasting. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics,
we explored the possibility of developing quantum algorithms that could solve complex weather
forecasting problems more efficiently than classical computers. Although this line of inquiry is
still in its infancy, it has already yielded some intriguing results, with certain quantum algorithms
showing a significant speedup over their classical counterparts. The implications of this research are
profound, suggesting that quantum computing could revolutionize the field of weather forecasting in
the not-too-distant future.
Despite the progress made, our methodology is not without its challenges and limitations. One of
the main hurdles we faced was the issue of data quality and availability. The accuracy of weather
forecasts is heavily dependent on the quality of the input data, and any inconsistencies or gaps in the
data can significantly impact the model’s performance. Moreover, the collection of certain types of
weather data, such as high-resolution satellite imagery, can be expensive and logistically challenging.
To address these challenges, we had to develop innovative solutions, including data augmentation
techniques and novel sensor systems, to improve the quality and availability of weather data.
5
The complexity of weather systems also poses a significant challenge to our models. Weather patterns
are influenced by a myriad of factors, including atmospheric conditions, ocean currents, and terrestrial
processes, making it difficult to develop models that can accurately capture these interactions. To
overcome this, we have had to develop highly sophisticated models that can account for these complex
interactions and make predictions based on a deep understanding of the underlying physics. This has
involved the incorporation of advanced techniques, such as ensemble forecasting and model output
statistics, to improve the accuracy and reliability of our predictions.
In conclusion, our methodology for neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting represents a
significant advancement in the field. By combining cutting-edge techniques from computer science
and meteorology, we have developed a robust and flexible framework that can make highly accurate
predictions of weather conditions. While there are still challenges to be addressed, the potential of
this research to improve our understanding of weather patterns and enhance forecasting capabilities
is vast. As we continue to refine and expand our methodology, we are confident that it will play an
increasingly important role in the field of meteorology, enabling better decision-making and more
effective planning in the face of complex and dynamic weather systems.

Experiments
To investigate the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance, we designed a comprehen-
sive experimental framework that integrated both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The
study was conducted over a period of two years, covering multiple regions with diverse climatic
conditions and socioeconomic profiles. We began by establishing a network of community-based
organizations that served as hubs for data collection, participant recruitment, and policy implementa-
tion. These organizations played a crucial role in facilitating trust among the local population, which
was essential for the success of the experiment.
The experimental design involved the creation of multiple treatment groups, each receiving a different
variant of the cooperative rainfall insurance policy. The policies varied in terms of premium rates,
payout structures, and enrollment requirements, allowing us to assess the sensitivity of outcomes
to these parameters. Additionally, a control group was established, consisting of individuals who
did not participate in any insurance program, to provide a baseline for comparison. The selection of
participants for each group was randomized to minimize biases and ensure that the results could be
generalized across different populations.
One of the innovative aspects of our approach was the incorporation of a bizarre incentive mechanism,
designed to encourage participants to adopt risk-mitigating behaviors. Specifically, we introduced
a reward system that offered participants a chance to win a livestock animal of their choice (such
as a cow, goat, or chicken) if they achieved a predefined level of compliance with recommended
agricultural practices. This approach was based on the hypothesis that the prospect of receiving a
tangible, livelihood-enhancing asset would motivate individuals to take proactive steps in managing
climate-related risks. While this method may seem unconventional, it was intended to tap into the
psychological and social aspects of decision-making, potentially leading to more sustainable and
resilient outcomes.
The data collection process was multifaceted, involving both survey-based instruments and observa-
tional studies. We conducted extensive interviews with participants to gather information on their
socioeconomic status, agricultural practices, risk perceptions, and experiences with the insurance
program. Furthermore, we implemented a monitoring system to track key indicators such as crop
yields, soil health, and water usage patterns. This comprehensive dataset enabled us to evaluate
the impact of cooperative rainfall insurance on a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes, including
income stability, food security, and social cohesion.
To analyze the effectiveness of our experimental interventions, we employed a combination of
statistical models and machine learning algorithms. These tools allowed us to identify patterns
and correlations within the data, as well as to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes based on
a set of input variables. The results of these analyses were then used to refine the design of the
insurance policies and to inform the development of supportive programs and services. For instance,
we discovered that participants who received training on climate-resilient agriculture were more
likely to adopt these practices and, consequently, experienced fewer crop failures and higher incomes.
6
In an effort to further enhance the validity and reliability of our findings, we also conducted a series
of focus groups and community workshops. These interactive sessions provided a platform for
participants to share their experiences, raise concerns, and suggest improvements to the insurance
program. The feedback gathered through these events was invaluable, as it highlighted the importance
of community involvement, transparency, and accountability in the design and implementation
of cooperative rainfall insurance initiatives. By integrating the perspectives and needs of local
stakeholders, we were able to create a more inclusive and responsive framework for managing
climate-related risks.
The experimental framework also included a component focused on the development of innovative
technologies and tools to support the implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance. We collabo-
rated with a team of software developers to design a mobile application that enabled participants to
access information on weather forecasts, agricultural practices, and insurance policy details. This
application also included a feature for reporting crop losses and submitting claims, which streamlined
the process and reduced the administrative burden on both participants and program administrators.
Furthermore, we explored the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies to monitor
crop health and detect early signs of stress, allowing for more timely and targeted interventions.
To assess the financial viability of the cooperative rainfall insurance program, we conducted a detailed
cost-benefit analysis. This involved estimating the costs associated with program administration, pre-
mium collection, and payout disbursement, as well as the benefits accruing to participants in the form
of reduced risk, increased incomes, and improved livelihoods. The results of this analysis indicated
that the program was financially sustainable, with the benefits exceeding the costs by a significant
margin. However, we also identified areas for improvement, such as reducing administrative costs
and enhancing the efficiency of payout disbursement. By addressing these challenges, we can further
enhance the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance and ensure its long-term viability.
In addition to the quantitative aspects of the experiment, we also explored the qualitative dimensions
of cooperative rainfall insurance. Through a series of case studies and ethnographic analyses, we
examined the social and cultural contexts in which the insurance program was implemented. This
involved investigating the role of social networks, community norms, and cultural values in shaping
the adoption and effectiveness of the program. The findings from these studies highlighted the
importance of considering the local context and adapting the program design to meet the specific
needs and preferences of different communities. By doing so, we can create a more nuanced and
responsive approach to cooperative rainfall insurance, one that acknowledges the diversity and
complexity of human experiences.
The experiment also incorporated a unique approach to evaluating the environmental impact of
cooperative rainfall insurance. We used a set of ecological indicators, such as soil erosion rates
and biodiversity indices, to assess the effects of the program on environmental sustainability. The
results showed that participants who adopted climate-resilient agricultural practices experienced
significant reductions in soil erosion and improvements in biodiversity, compared to those who did
not participate in the program. These findings suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance can have
positive environmental externalities, contributing to the conservation of natural resources and the
promotion of sustainable agriculture.
Overall, the experimental framework provided a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to
investigating the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance. By integrating qualitative
and quantitative methodologies, incorporating innovative technologies and tools, and considering
the environmental and social contexts of program implementation, we were able to gain a deeper
understanding of the complex relationships between climate risk, agricultural practices, and livelihood
outcomes. The findings from this study have important implications for the design and implementation
of cooperative rainfall insurance programs, highlighting the need for a nuanced and adaptive approach
that acknowledges the diversity and complexity of human experiences.
The table above summarizes the experimental design and outcomes, highlighting the different
treatment groups, insurance policies, and outcome measures. The results of the experiment showed
that participants in the high-risk group, who received the comprehensive policy, experienced the most
significant improvements in income, crop yield, food security, and social cohesion. Additionally, this
group demonstrated the highest levels of environmental sustainability, as measured by soil erosion
rates and biodiversity indices. These findings suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance can have a
positive impact on both socioeconomic and environmental outcomes, particularly when designed and

Results
The analysis of the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance revealed a complex web
of interactions between the insured farmers, the insurance providers, and the local communities. Our
research uncovered that the implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance led to a significant
reduction in poverty rates among farming households, with an average decrease of 23.5
One of the most striking findings was the correlation between the level of rainfall insurance coverage
and the level of community cohesion. Our data showed that villages with higher levels of insurance
coverage also had higher levels of community engagement, with 75
However, our research also revealed some unexpected outcomes. For example, we found that the
introduction of cooperative rainfall insurance led to a significant increase in the number of villagers
who reported seeing UFOs. This phenomenon, which we termed ""Rainfall Insurance-Induced UFO
Sightings"" (RIUFS), was observed in 42
To further investigate the effects of cooperative rainfall insurance, we conducted a series of surveys
and interviews with villagers. The results of these surveys are presented in the following table:

As can be seen from the table, there is a clear correlation between the level of insurance coverage and
the socioeconomic outcomes. Villages with higher levels of insurance coverage tend to have lower
poverty rates, higher levels of community cohesion, and higher crop yields. However, the relationship
between insurance coverage and UFO sightings is less clear, and further research is needed to fully
understand this phenomenon.
In addition to the surveys and interviews, we also conducted a series of focus groups with villagers
to gather more detailed information about their experiences with cooperative rainfall insurance.
The focus groups revealed that many villagers were initially skeptical about the insurance program,
but eventually came to see it as a valuable tool for managing risk and improving their livelihoods.
However, some villagers also reported feeling anxious or stressed about the potential for drought or
excessive rainfall, and the impact that this could have on their crops and livelihoods.
To address these concerns, we developed a new approach that we termed ""Mindful Farming."" This
approach involves teaching farmers mindfulness techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing,
to help them manage stress and anxiety. We also provided farmers with access to a mobile app that
allows them to track rainfall patterns and receive alerts when heavy rainfall is predicted. The results
of this approach were striking, with 90
Overall, our research suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance can have a significant impact on the
socioeconomic well-being of farming communities. However, the relationship between insurance
8
coverage and socioeconomic outcomes is complex, and further research is needed to fully understand
the mechanisms at play. Additionally, the phenomenon of RIUFS remains a mystery, and further
investigation is needed to determine its causes and consequences. Despite these challenges, our
research suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance has the potential to be a powerful tool for
improving the livelihoods of farming communities, and reducing poverty and inequality in rural areas.
Furthermore, we also explored the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to be used as a tool
for promoting sustainable agriculture practices. Our research found that farmers who participated
in the insurance program were more likely to adopt sustainable practices, such as crop rotation and
organic farming, and were also more likely to invest in soil conservation and water management.
This suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance could be a key component of a broader strategy for
promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing the environmental impact of farming.
Moreover, our research also examined the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to be used
as a tool for promoting social justice and equality. We found that the insurance program had a
disproportionate benefit for marginalized groups, such as women and minority farmers, who were
more likely to be vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity. This suggests that cooperative rainfall
insurance could be a key component of a broader strategy for promoting social justice and reducing
inequality in rural areas.
In conclusion, our research highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of cooperative rainfall
insurance, and the need for further research to fully understand its mechanisms and impacts. While the
phenomenon of RIUFS remains a mystery, our research suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance
has the potential to be a powerful tool for improving the livelihoods of farming communities,
promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and promoting social justice and equality. As such, we
recommend that policymakers and practitioners consider the potential benefits of cooperative rainfall
insurance, and work to develop and implement programs that can help to promote these outcomes.
Additionally, we also recommend that future research should focus on exploring the potential for
cooperative rainfall insurance to be used in conjunction with other development programs, such as
microfinance and agricultural extension services. This could help to create a more comprehensive
and integrated approach to development, and could help to promote more sustainable and equitable
outcomes for farming communities. Furthermore, we also recommend that future research should
focus on exploring the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to be used in different contexts and
settings, such as urban and peri-urban areas, and could help to promote more innovative and effective
solutions to the challenges facing these communities.
The implications of our research are far-reaching, and suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance
could be a key component of a broader strategy for promoting development and reducing poverty
in rural areas. As such, we hope that our research will contribute to a greater understanding of
the potential benefits and challenges of cooperative rainfall insurance, and will help to inform the
development of more effective and sustainable programs for promoting development and reducing
poverty.
Moreover, our research also highlights the importance of considering the social and cultural context
in which cooperative rainfall insurance is implemented. We found that the success of the program
was heavily dependent on the level of community engagement and participation, and that the program
was more effective in villages where there was a strong sense of community cohesion and trust. This
suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance should be implemented in a way that is sensitive to the
local context, and that takes into account the social and cultural norms and values of the community.
In terms of policy implications, our research suggests that policymakers should consider the potential
benefits of cooperative rainfall insurance, and should work to develop and implement programs that
can help to promote these outcomes. This could involve providing support for the development of
cooperative rainfall insurance programs, such as providing funding or technical assistance, and could
also involve working to create an enabling environment for the implementation of these programs.
Additionally, policymakers should also consider the potential risks and challenges associated with
cooperative rainfall insurance, and should work to develop strategies for mitigating these risks and
addressing these challenges.
Overall, our research highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of cooperative rainfall insurance,
and the need for further research to fully understand its mechanisms and impacts. While the
phenomenon of RIUFS remains a mystery, our research suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance

has the potential to be a powerful tool for improving the livelihoods of farming communities,
promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and promoting social justice and equality. As such,
we hope that our research will contribute to a greater understanding of the potential benefits and
challenges of cooperative rainfall insurance, and will help to inform the development of more effective
and sustainable programs for promoting development and reducing poverty.
Finally, we also recommend that future research should focus on exploring the potential for coopera-
tive rainfall insurance to be used in conjunction with other technologies, such as satellite imaging
and machine learning. This could help to create a more comprehensive and integrated approach
to development, and could help to promote more sustainable and equitable outcomes for farming
communities. Furthermore, we also recommend that future research should focus on exploring the
potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to be used in different contexts and settings, such as
urban and peri-urban areas, and could help to promote more innovative and effective solutions to the
challenges facing these communities.

Conclusion
The socioeconomic implications of cooperative rainfall insurance are far-reaching and multifaceted,
necessitating a comprehensive analysis of its effects on various stakeholders and the environment.
It is essential to recognize that the implementation of such insurance schemes can have a profound
impact on the livelihoods of farmers, rural communities, and the overall economy. By providing
financial protection against rainfall-related risks, cooperative rainfall insurance can help mitigate
the adverse effects of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, thereby enhancing food
security and reducing poverty.
Moreover, the cooperative aspect of this insurance model fosters a sense of community and social
cohesion, as participants work together to manage risks and share resources. This collective approach
can lead to the development of more resilient and adaptable communities, better equipped to cope
with the challenges posed by climate change. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the success of
cooperative rainfall insurance depends on various factors, including the effectiveness of the insurance
scheme, the level of participation, and the availability of resources.
In a bizarre twist, some researchers have suggested that cooperative rainfall insurance could be used
as a tool for promoting inter-species cooperation and even communication with plants. According
to this theory, the insurance scheme could be designed to provide incentives for farmers to adopt
practices that promote soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, which in turn could lead to
more harmonious relationships between humans and plants. While this approach may seem illogical
at first glance, it highlights the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to have far-reaching and
unexpected consequences that transcend traditional socioeconomic boundaries.
The potential applications of cooperative rainfall insurance are vast and varied, ranging from small-
scale agricultural projects to large-scale industrial operations. In the context of sustainable develop-
ment, this type of insurance could play a vital role in promoting environmentally friendly practices,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural resources. Furthermore, the coopera-
tive model could be replicated in other sectors, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure
development, to create more equitable and resilient systems.
A critical examination of the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance reveals a
complex web of relationships between economic, social, and environmental factors. It is essential to
consider the long-term consequences of such insurance schemes, including their potential to create
new forms of dependency, exacerbate existing social inequalities, or disrupt traditional ways of
life. Nevertheless, the benefits of cooperative rainfall insurance, including its potential to reduce
poverty, promote social cohesion, and enhance environmental sustainability, make it an attractive
option for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking innovative solutions to pressing global
challenges.
Ultimately, the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance will depend on the specific
context in which it is implemented, including the cultural, economic, and environmental characteristics
of the region. As such, it is crucial to adopt a nuanced and adaptive approach, one that takes into
account the diverse needs and perspectives of various stakeholders, including farmers, communities,
governments, and the private sector. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of cooperative
10
rainfall insurance to create a more just, equitable, and sustainable world, where the risks and benefits
of climate change are shared fairly and responsibly.
The importance of continued research and development in this area cannot be overstated, as it has the
potential to revolutionize the way we approach risk management, social protection, and environmental
conservation. By exploring new frontiers in cooperative rainfall insurance, we may uncover novel
solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, from climate change and food insecurity
to social inequality and economic instability. As we move forward, it is essential to maintain a critical
and open-minded perspective, one that acknowledges the complexities and uncertainties of this
emerging field, while embracing its transformative potential to create a better future for all.
In addition to its practical applications, cooperative rainfall insurance also raises fundamental ques-
tions about the nature of risk, responsibility, and cooperation in the face of uncertainty. As we
navigate the complexities of climate change, it is essential to develop new theoretical frameworks and

By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of cooperative rainfall insurance to promote sustainable
development, reduce poverty, and enhance environmental sustainability, while also creating a more
just and equitable world for all.
As we consider the future of cooperative rainfall insurance, it is essential to recognize the potential for
this type of insurance to create new forms of social and economic organization, ones that prioritize

solidarity, cooperative rainfall insurance can help create more resilient and adaptable communities,
better equipped to cope with the challenges of climate change and other global crises. Ultimately, the
success of cooperative rainfall insurance will depend on our ability to create a more just, equitable,
and sustainable world, where the benefits and risks of this innovative approach to risk management
are shared fairly and responsibly.
The role of technology in the development and implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance
schemes is also critical, as it can help facilitate more efficient, effective, and inclusive forms of risk
management. By leveraging advances in data analytics, satellite imaging, and mobile communications,

P092.pdf,"Enhanced Image Compression Through Advanced
Residual Network Architectures
Abstract
This manuscript provides an in-depth explanation of the methodology developed
for a recent image compression challenge. The method primarily incorporates two
innovative aspects: the application of advanced residual networks for enhanced
compression and the utilization of sub-pixel convolution techniques for efficient
up-sampling during decompression. The efficacy of these methodologies, which
achieved a high Multiscale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) of 0.972 under
a strict bit rate constraint of 0.15 bits per pixel (bpp) while maintaining reasonable
computational demands during the evaluation stage.
1
Introduction
Image compression remains a crucial research area within the field of signal processing, aiming to
facilitate more efficient data storage and transfer. Conventional image compression algorithms, like
the various JPEG standards, often employ manually designed encoder/decoder frameworks. However,
with the emergence of novel image formats and the proliferation of high-resolution mobile devices,
there is a growing recognition that existing standards may not represent the most effective or universal
solutions for image compression.
Recently, deep learning-based techniques have shown a surge of progress in the image compression
domain. Some of these methods employ generative models, trained adversarially, to effectively learn
the underlying distribution of images, resulting in impressive subjective quality even at exceptionally
low bit rates. Other works utilize recurrent neural networks to iteratively compress residual informa-
tion, enabling progressive coding which allows for multiple quality levels within a single compression
operation. Further advancements have been made by focusing on relaxing quantization constraints
and improving entropy modeling, leading to enhanced performance compared to established image
compression methods.
Nevertheless, identifying an optimal network structure presents a formidable challenge across various
machine learning applications, including image compression. This paper primarily discusses two
important aspects of network design for image compression. The first concerns the selection of kernel
size, a parameter that significantly influences compression effectiveness in traditional algorithms.
Motivated by its impact in classical methods, this paper presents experiments that use different filter
sizes to prove that larger kernel sizes contribute to improved coding efficiency. Building upon this, a
strategy is presented that utilizes a deep residual learning approach, allowing for the maintenance
of a broad receptive field while utilizing a reduced number of parameters. This approach not only
decreases the model’s overall size but also substantially enhances its performance. Additionally,
the architecture of up-sampling operations within the decoder plays a pivotal role in determining
the quality of reconstructed images and the presence of artifacts. This issue, extensively studied in
the context of super-resolution, involves various implementations for up-sampling layers, such as
interpolation, transposed convolution, and sub-pixel convolution. This work compares two commonly
used up-sampling methods, transposed and sub-pixel convolutions, to demonstrate their relative
performance in the context of image compression.
.
2
Methodology
The fundamental network architectures employed in this research are based on prior works that
have demonstrated state-of-the-art compression performance. The network is structured as a pair
of autoencoders. The primary autoencoder is responsible for optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff
inherent in image compression. The loss function can be expressed as:
J = λd(x, ˆx) + R(ˆy)
(1)
where λ is a parameter that balances the importance of rate and distortion. The secondary autoencoder
handles the encoding of side information, which is used to model the probability distribution of the
compressed data. A Gaussian scale mixture approach is utilized to develop an image-adaptive entropy
model, with scale parameters conditioned on a hyperprior.
2.1
From Small Kernel Size to Large Kernel Size
In traditional image compression techniques, the size of transform filters significantly affects coding
efficiency, especially for high-definition videos. Initially, transform sizes were small, but as the field
progressed, there was a gradual shift towards larger sizes to better capture spatial correlations and
semantic details. The experiments detailed in this paper, using a standard dataset, explore the impact
of different filter sizes in both the main and auxiliary autoencoders. Table 1 indicates that for the
Baseline architecture, larger kernel sizes lead to better rate-distortion outcomes. Similarly, Table
2 demonstrates comparable improvements for the HyperPrior architectures. Table 3 reveals that
employing large kernels in the auxiliary autoencoder does not enhance rate-distortion performance
and may even negatively impact it. This is likely due to the small size of the compressed codes, which
makes smaller kernels sufficient for effective encoding. An excessive number of trainable parameters
can hinder the learning process.

From Shallow Network to Deep Residual Network
In terms of receptive field coverage, a sequence of four 3x3 kernels can encompass the same area as
a single 9x9 kernel but with a reduced parameter count. Initial attempts to substitute a large kernel
with multiple 3x3 filters encountered convergence issues during training. To address this, shortcut
connections were incorporated between adjacent 3x3 kernels. The resultant deep residual network
2
architecture for image compression is denoted as ResNet-3x3(4), signifying that a stack of four 3x3
kernels achieves an equivalent receptive field to a 9x9 kernel. To minimize parameter overhead,
GDN/IGDN activation functions are applied only once within each residual unit when the output
dimensions change. For the remaining convolutional layers, parameter-free Leaky ReLU activations
are employed to introduce non-linearity. As indicated in Table 4, ResNet-3x3(4) surpasses both
ResNet-3x3(3) and Hyperprior-9 in terms of performance.

Upsampling Operations at Decoder Side
The encoder-decoder structure is characterized by its symmetrical design. While down-sampling at
the encoder is typically achieved using strided convolution filters, up-sampling at the decoder can be
implemented through various methods, such as bicubic interpolation, transposed convolution, and
sub-pixel convolution. Considering the importance of rapid end-to-end learning, bicubic interpolation
was excluded, and a comparison was made between the two widely used up-sampling techniques:
transposed convolution (TConv) and sub-pixel convolution (SubPixel). To implement sub-pixel
convolution, the channel count is expanded fourfold, followed by the application of a depth-to-space
operation. The results presented in Table 4 demonstrate that sub-pixel convolution filters offer slight
improvements in both PSNR and MS-SSIM compared to transposed convolution filters.
3
Experiments
For the training process, 256x256 image patches were extracted from a large-scale image dataset. A
batch size of 8 was employed, and training was conducted for up to 2 million iterations to ensure
stable convergence. Optimization was performed using the Adam optimizer, with an initial learning
rate of 1 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, reduced to 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for the final 80,000 iterations.
Two primary strategies were implemented. The first strategy, termed ""Wide Bottleneck,"" involves
increasing the model’s capacity by expanding the number of filters. Since increasing filters in large
feature maps significantly increases computational cost (FLOPs), the filter count was only raised in
the encoder’s final layer, from 128 to 192. This results in a minor FLOPs increase, as detailed in Table
5. While Bottleneck192 effectively reduces the bit rate, it also leads to some quality degradation
compared to Bottleneck128.

The second strategy is ""Rate Control."" For achieving a target bit rate, two models are trained at
distinct bit rates by adjusting the λ parameter. This allows for adaptive selection during encoding to
approach the target bit rate while maximizing MS-SSIM, as shown in Table 6. A single bit is added
to the bitstream to indicate the model used for decoding, without increasing decoder complexity.

While deep residual networks enhance coding gain, they also lead to a substantial increase in model
size. This section analyzes the parameter count and model complexity in terms of floating-point
operations per second (FLOPs) for various architectures. Specifically, using the HyperPrior-9
architecture as an example, Table 8 provides a layer-wise breakdown of model size. The number of
parameters and FLOPs are calculated as follows:
Para = (h × w × Cin + 1) × Cout
(2)
FLOPs = Para × H′ × W ′
(3)
where h × w represents the kernel size, H′ × W ′ denotes the output dimensions, and Cin and Cout
are the number of input and output channels, respectively. The +1 term is omitted when no bias
is used. Quantization and leaky-ReLU are parameter-free. GDN operates across channels but not
spatial positions, resulting in a parameter count of (Cin + 1) × Cout. The total FLOPs for GDN
and inverse GDN calculations are minimal. This analysis primarily focuses on the backbone of
convolutional layers, so the FLOPs of GDN, inverse GDN, and factorized prior are not included in the
comparison. Table 9 presents a comparison of different architectures, with the last column showing
the relative FLOPs using Baseline-5 as the reference. The proposed models achieve improved coding
performance with relatively low computational complexity.

Conclusion
This manuscript details the proposed deep residual learning framework and sub-pixel convolution
technique for image compression, forming the foundation of the submitted entries: Kattolab, Katto-
labv2, and KattolabSSIM. The results demonstrate that these approaches achieve a high MS-SSIM of
0.972 under a bit rate constraint of 0.15 bpp, while maintaining a moderate level of computational
complexity during the validation phase.

P108.pdf,"Progress Towards Eliciting Organized Phoneme
Structures
Abstract
Phonological typology, a vital area within linguistic studies, examines the patterns
and functions of sounds across the world’s languages. This paper offers an overview
of completed and ongoing experiments utilizing phonological representations,
derived from typological databases, in speech processing tasks. It primarily focuses
on two lines of inquiry motivated by the need to adapt speech technologies to low-
resource languages and dialects. Initially, a framework is presented for evaluating
the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological characteristics within multilingual
phoneme inventories. Subsequently, an outline is given for a method that could
potentially contribute to the development of future phoneme inventory induction
systems, highlighting the crucial role of phonological typology in this process.
1
Introduction
The field of phonological typology investigates the distribution and functionality of sounds in
languages globally. Typological databases are instrumental in making generalizations in this domain.
These resources are valuable not only for creating probabilistic models of phonological typology but
also for enhancing downstream multilingual NLP, speech technology, and language documentation
efforts.
This paper summarizes our research involving phonological representations in speech processing,
utilizing phonological typology databases. Despite the prevalence of end-to-end approaches in
automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech translation, the integration of
precise phonological knowledge remains essential in various scenarios.
Our research is driven by the goal of extending speech technologies, which still rely on phonological
representations, to under-resourced languages and dialects. We first review a framework designed to
analyze the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological features in multilingual phoneme inventories
obtained from cross-lingual typological databases. We then propose a preliminary method that may
act as a foundational element in a future phoneme inventory induction system, emphasizing the
significance of phonological typology in such an approach.
2
Multilingual Phoneme Inventories
Traditionally, a phoneme is defined as a theoretical concept specific to a single language. Applying
phonemes and their feature encodings across languages presents a challenge: it’s unclear whether all
distinctive features (DFs) will be relevant or applicable in a multilingual phoneme inventory taken
from a typological database. If DF representations were phonetic instead of phonemic, and acoustic
rather than articulatory, one might anticipate a strong correlation between DFs and the acoustic
signal. However, in practical multilingual contexts, these representations are frequently influenced by
phonemic considerations due to the accessibility of phonemic inventories and transcriptions.
Our approach was straightforward: a phonemic contrast is deemed consistent across languages if it
can be reliably predicted in a binary classification task on withheld languages. This problem involves
a segment of a speech signal and a label (e.g., front vowel vs. back vowel). A classifier is trained on a
multilingual, multi-speaker dataset, excluding some languages for later assessment. In cases where
cross-linguistic consistency was lacking, we enhanced the method by basing the representation on
contextual phonological knowledge provided as DFs, excluding the contrast being tested.
Our experiments involved languages from the Dravidian, Indo-European, and Malayo-Polynesian
families, with phoneme inventories sourced from a phonological database. The results are varied. An
experiment designed to predict contrasts in unvoiced labial consonants between specific languages
yielded reliable predictions across languages. Similar consistency was observed for contrasts between
front and back vowels, as well as vowel height and continuant manner of articulation distinctions.
Negative outcomes include the cross-lingual prediction of retroflex consonants between language
families: a predictor trained on Dravidian languages cannot accurately predict retroflex consonants in
another language, and vice versa. The detection of aspiration was similarly inconsistent. Incorporating
other contrasts as contextual features did not result in significant improvement for these complex
cases.
Our research is partly motivated by a persistent question: Can this methodology assess the cross-
linguistic validity of existing phoneme inventories given available data? For example, among the
Malayo-Polynesian languages studied, only one has retroflex consonants, acquired from loanwords
from other language families. Different phoneme inventories exist for this language, one of which
includes retroflex plosives, while another omits them. Determining which representation is superior
in a multilingual pronunciation model remains an open issue.
3
Towards Phonology Induction
Our current research efforts are directed towards the induction of phoneme inventories for languages
that lack the standard resources needed for speech model training. This task aligns with other work
in zero-resource subword modeling. Existing unsupervised methods for discovering acoustic units
derive acoustic-phonetic and latent auditory-like representations, but the typological accuracy of
these representations is uncertain.
Our initial work with ""universal"" multilingual phoneme recognizers was not successful. This was
mainly because the limited training data and the lack of language models to guide the search frequently
led to unreliable phoneme inventory recovery even for closely related dialects, for instance, in trying
to identify the phoneme inventory of one dialect after being exposed to two others. An improved
strategy involves incorporating language identification and phonological typology into the phoneme
recognizer. Using an accurate language identification model, the phoneme inventories of the most
closely related languages can be employed to narrow down the potential phonemic hypotheses for a
new, previously unseen language or dialect.
We are currently adapting the phonological contrast predictor methods from the previous section for
phonology induction tasks. Several approaches for detecting phonemic features in continuous speech
are known, some relying solely on signal processing and others that are model-based. At a basic
level, the output of such predictors represents speech as parallel, asynchronous streams of articulatory
features. More complex models that utilize the structure of articulation, feature geometry, and other
correlations between features are also feasible. In these methods, cross-linguistic phonological
databases are crucial for not only integrating various features into phonemes but also for validating
which combinations of hypothesized phonemes are acceptable based on known phoneme inventories.
Furthermore, additional phonological insights from other typological resources can be incorporated if
they can be reliably extracted from the speech signal.

P125.pdf,"DISCOSENSE: Commonsense Reasoning with
Discourse Connectives
Abstract
We present DISCOSENSE, a benchmark for commonsense reasoning via un-
derstanding a wide variety of discourse connectives. We generate compelling
distractors in DISCOSENSE using Conditional Adversarial Filtering, an extension
of Adversarial Filtering that employs conditional generation. We show that state
of-the-art pre-trained language models struggle to perform well on DISCOSENSE,
which makes this dataset ideal for evaluating next generation commonsense rea-
soning systems.
1
Introduction
This paper addresses the critical need for challenging benchmarks that can reliably target the limita-
tions of current pre-trained language models (LMs) in commonsense reasoning. State-of-the-art LMs
have achieved or even surpassed human performance on numerous commonsense downstream tasks.
Nevertheless, these LMs are still very far from being able to perform commonsense reasoning as well
as humans. Hence, the fact that they have begun to ace existing benchmarks implies that time is ripe
to design a new challenging benchmark that can reliably target their limitations.
Motivated by this observation, we present DISCOSENSE, a benchmark for performing commonsense
reasoning through understanding a wide variety of discourse connectives. Figure 1 shows an example
taken from DISCOSENSE. As can be seen, an example is composed of a context (e.g., “Our waitress
was very nice, but she kept on forgetting my stuff.”) and a discourse connective (e.g., “For example”),
and the goal is to choose the most plausible ending out of four options. If we ignore the discourse
connective, then all four options may
Our waitress was very nice, but she kept on forgetting my stuff. For example
a) When I ordered the garlic shrimp, she remembered to add my requested garlic butter.
b) She took forever to bring me my beer and fries.
c) When I told her I wanted to use the free breakfast that was available she was not pleased.
d) For some customers, this is fine.

plausible) option is boldfaced.
seem plausible because we do not know what the writer’s intent is. Once we consider both the context
and the discourse connective, then it is clear that only option b) is plausible. The reason is that “For
example” signals an EXEMPLIFICATION relation between its arguments, and what follows the
discourse connective is expected to be an example of the waitress keeping on forgetting the writer’s
stuff. Using commonsense knowledge, we know that (1) “my beer and fries” is an example of “my
stuff”, and (2) her taking forever to bring the writer stuff implies she kept on forgetting his/her stuff.
What if we replace “For example” with “However” in the example? Since “However” signals a
CONTRAST relation, options a) and d) both seem viable. Specifically, option a) describes a situation
in which she did not forget the writer’s stuff. While option d), unlike option a), does not describe
any example that signals a contrast, one may infer a contrast between option d) and the context:
being forgetful is fine for some customers. Nevertheless, option a) is arguably more plausible than
option d) and should be chosen. The reason is that for d) to be sensible, one needs to assume that her
forgetting the writer’s stuff implies that she is in general forgetful. Without this assumption, it may
be strange for other customers to have an opinion on her forgetting the writer’s stuff. In general, the
most plausible option is the option that makes the smallest number of assumptions, and/or is the most
coherent given the context and the discourse connective. Considering the commonsense knowledge
and the reasoning involved, it should not be difficult to see that this task is challenging.
Our contributions are four-fold. First, we create DISCOSENSE, a new dataset aimed at testing
LMs’ commonsense reasoning capabilities through discourse connectives. Second, we employ a
controlled text generation based adversarial filtering approach to generate compelling negatives.
Third, we establish baseline results on DISCOSENSE with numerous state-of-the-art discriminator
models and show that they struggle to perform well on DISCOSENSE, which makes our dataset
an ideal benchmark for next-generation commonsense reasoning systems. Finally, we show the
efficacy of using DISCOSENSE as a transfer learning resource through sequential fine-tuning of
LMs on DISCOSENSE followed by HELLASWAG and achieve near state-of-the-art results on the
HELLASWAG test set. To stimulate work on this task, we make our code and data publicly available.

Related Work
In this section, we discuss related work, focusing our discussion on the differences between DIS-
COSENSE and existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In addition, we present an overview of
Adversarial Filtering, which will facilitate the introduction of the Conditional Adversarial Filtering
mechanism we propose in Section 3.
Commonsense reasoning benchmarks. SWAG and HELLASWAG are arguably the most prominent
commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In SWAG, given a partial description along with four candidate
endings, the task is to predict the most plausible ending. The synthetic options (a.k.a. distractors)
are generated through a process called Adversarial Filtering (AF) (see below). HELLASWAG is an
extension of SWAG that seeks to eliminate artifacts in the generated endings. Unlike SWAG and
HELLASWAG, DISCOSENSE requires that the discourse connective be taken into account in the
reasoning process, thus increasing the number of inference steps and potentially the task complexity.
In addition, while the examples in SWAG and HELLASWAG come primarily from ActivityNet (a
benchmark focused on dense captioning of temporal events),
DISCOSENSE features a more diverse set of examples coming from varied domains that may only
be solved with rich background knowledge.
There are benchmarks that aim to test different kinds of commonsense reasoning abilities, although
none of them focuses on reasoning over discourse connectives. SocialIQA, for instance, focuses on
social and emotional commonsense reasoning. ABDUCTIVE NLI focuses on abductive reasoning.
WINOGRANDE contains Winograd schema-inspired problems, which are essentially hard pronoun
resolution problems requiring world knowledge. PIQA examines physical commonsense reasoning.
MCTACO and TIMEDIAL focus on temporal reasoning in comprehension and dialogue formats.
More closely related to DISCOSENSE are commonsense reasoning benchmarks that involve reason-
ing with a particular kind of relations. COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) focuses exclusively
on reasoning with CAUSAL relations and involves choosing the more plausible ending out of two
(rather than four) options. P-MCQA focuses exclusively on reasoning with PRECONDITION rela-
tions: given a commonsense fact, select the precondition that make the fact possible (enabling) or
impossible (disabling) out of four options. NLI, which aims to evaluate defensible inference, focuses
exclusively on reasoning with the STRENGTHEN/WEAKEN relations: given a premise-claim pair
where the premise supports the claim, generate a sentence that either strengthens or weakens the
support. WINOVENTI, which is composed of Winogradstyle schemas, focuses exclusively on
reasoning with ENTAILMENT relations: given two sentences with an entailment relation, such as
”Pete says the pear is delicious. The pear is ”, the goal is to fill in the blank with one of two choices
(e.g., ”edible”, ”inedible”). There are two key differences between these datasets and DISCOSENSE.
First, rather than focusing on a particular type of relation, DISCOSENSE encompasses 37 discourse
connectives signaling different discourse relation types. Second, DISCOSENSE involves reasoning

with discourse connectives, which is more complicated than reasoning with discourse relations.
Specifically, as some connectives are sense-ambiguous
(e.g., the connective “since” may serve as a temporal or causal connective), a LM will likely need to
(implicitly) perform sense disambiguation in order to perform well on DISCOSENSE.
There are datasets and knowledge bases where the semantic/discourse/commonsense relations are
explicitly annotated and which can provide data sources from which commonsense reasoning bench-
marks can be derived. Examples include (1) the Penn Discourse TreeBank, where two sentences or
text segments are annotated with their discourse relation type, if any; (2) COREQUISITE, which
is used to provide the commonsense facts and the human-generated preconditions in the P-MCQA
dataset mentioned above; (3) SNLI, where each premise-hypothesis pair is annotated as ENTAIL-
MENT, CONTRADICTION, or NEUTRAL; (4) ATOMIC20, which is a commonsense knowledge
graph where the nodes correspond to propositions and the edges correspond to social/physical
commonsense relations; and (5) SOCIAL-CHEM-101, which is a collection of statements about
commonsense social judgments made given everyday situations.
One of the motivations behind the creation of DISCOSENSE is that state-of-the-art LMs have man-
aged to achieve or even surpass human performance on various commonsense reasoning benchmarks.
Table 1 shows the best accuracies achieved by existing LMs on 10 widely used commonsense rea-
soning benchmarks and the corresponding human performance levels. As can be seen, existing LMs
have managed to achieve an accuracy of more than 80
Adversarial filtering (AF). Originally proposed by, AF aims to create examples that would be difficult
for models to solve, specifically by replacing the easy options in correctlysolved examples with
difficult ones. As shown in Figure 2, AF has three components: data (i.e., examples with multiple
options, one of which is correct), a discriminator LM (a classifier that is used to solve each example)
and a generator LM (a model that generates new options for an example). In each AF iteration, the
discriminator LM is trained on the training set and used to solve each example in the test set. If a test
example is incorrectly solved (i.e., the discriminator LM chooses the wrong option), the example
is deemed sufficiently difficult and no change is made to it. On the other hand, if a test example
is correctly solved, then AF seeks to increase its difficulty by replacing the easiest option (i.e., the
generated option that the discriminator LM classifies with the highest confidence) with a new option
generated by the generator LM. Training a new discriminator LM in each AF iteration ensures that
the dataset is not just adversarial for one LM but a class of LMs, as training different instances of
the same type of LMs results in models that have differently learned linguistic representations. This
process is repeated on all correctly classified examples in the test set until the performance on the test
set converges.

DISCOSENSE
3.1
Task Description
DISCOSENSE aims to measure the commonsense inference abilities of computational models
through the use of discourse connectives. The correct endings can be obtained after understanding
the purpose of the given discourse connectives. Given a context c <s, d>, which is composed of a
contextual sentence s and a discourse connective d as well as a set of four options O = o1, o2, o3, o4,
the task is to predict the most plausible ending oi belongs to O.
3.2
Dataset Creation
To assemble DISCOSENSE, we focus on source datasets that contain two sentences connected through
a discourse connective. Specifically, we use two peer reviewed academic datasets, DISCOVERY
and DISCOFUSE. In DISCOVERY, each sentence is composed of two sentences connected via
a discourse connective for the purpose of learning joint sentence representations with discourse
connectives. DISCOFUSE, on the other hand, is assembled for the task of sentence fusion (i.e.,
joining several independent sentences into a single coherent sentence). We only consider those
examples where a discourse connective is needed for sentence fusion, and include in DISCOSENSE
the fused sentences in the Wikipedia split of DISCOFUSE. Since these datasets contain sentences from
Common Crawl and Wikipedia articles, DISCOSENSE is diverse in the topics it covers. Importantly,
since by construction the discourse connective is crucial in solving the underlying tasks (i.e., sentence
representation learning and sentence fusion), the crucial role played by the discourse connectives
in these sentences makes them suitable for our use case. Details of how the DISCOVERY and
DISCOFUSE sentences are used to create DISCOSENSE are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
3.3
Generating Options
Next, we describe how we generate challenging options for DISCOSENSE using an improved version
of AF that we call Conditional Adversarial Filtering (CAF). CAF follows the AF procedure in Figure
2, only differing from AF in terms of (1) the generator LM (Section 3.3.1), (2) the discriminator LM
(Section 3.3.2), and (3) how the generator LMs are used to generate options (Section 3.3.3).
3.3.1
Conditional Generator LM
Pre-training does not explicitly teach how important a particular token or text span is in contributing
to the semantics of a sentence. Hence, to be able to generate sentences that are coherent with not
only the context but also the discourse connective, we propose to use Controllable Text Generation,
which aims to provide a more granular control over how generation happens to match a particular
attribute. In the context of Transformer-based LMs, there are two lines of research on controllable
text generation. One examines how to steer generation by fine-tuning an extra set of parameters while
keeping the base (unconditionally trained) model fixed while the other involves conditionally training
a generative model on a control variable to generate text w.r.t. a prompt prefix. We adopt the latter
4
approach, extending CTRL to explicitly steer generation w.r.t. discourse relations by using discourse
connectives as control codes, as described below.
Training. The input to CTRL is as follows:
input: <d> <contexts> label: <endings>
where d is a discourse connective. Specifically, each input context for CTRL is prepended with a
connective, and the training task for CTRL is to learn the conditional distribution p(e|d, context)
over possible endings e. The predicted ending is then compared with the human generated ending to
compute loss. Since the original CTRL model is pre-trained with control codes suitable for openended
text generation, we fine-tune CTRL on the portion of DISCOVERY shown in Table 3 using all the
174 connectives present in the selected splits. Comparing Tables 2 and 3, we can see that the data
the generator LM is fine-tuned on is not part of DISCOSENSE. Doing so ensures that the endings
generated by the generator LM are different from the ground truth (i.e., the human written endings).
Decoding. We use Nucleus sampling for generating options for the training set with the value of p set
to 0.7, which means the
weights of the tail of the probability distribution are ignored (i.e., tokens with a cumulative probability
mass of less than 0.3 are left out). Additionally, we use a length penalty of 0.8 to restrict the length of
the generations to match the average length of the ground truth to avoid the induction of length bias.
Efficacy of conditional generation. Recall that we propose the use of conditional generation, specifi-
cally the use of discourse connectives as control codes, in our generator LM because of our hypothesis
that the resulting LM would generate options that are more compliant with the purpose of the dis-
course connective. To test this hypothesis, we compare the text generation capability of CTRL
with that of GPT2-XL, a model that is trained unconditionally and has nearly the same number of
parameters (1.6B) as CTRL, under the same evaluation setting. Specifically, both LMs are fine-tuned
on the same data (see Table 3) using the same machine (a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch size
of 24). The only difference between them lies in the format of the training examples: in CTRL
the discourse connective is used as the control code and therefore precedes the context, whereas in
GPT2XL, the discourse connective follows the context.
The two LMs are then independently applied to generate exactly one option for each example in the
DISCOVERY validation set. CTRL achieves a much lower perplexity than GPT2-XL (2.39 vs. 2.53),
which suggests that conditional training improves the quality of the generated sentences.
3.3.2
Discriminator LM
We use ROBERTA-LARGE as the discriminator LM, which takes the context, the discourse connec-
tive, and the four endings as input and predicts the most plausible ending. This LM is trained on the
randomly shuffled training split of DISCOSENSE and applied to the DISCOSENSE test set to get
the confidence scores associated with its predictions.
3.3.3
Generating Options
Next, we describe how we generate options for the examples in DISCOSENSE. Recall that each
example contains one of 174 discourse connectives. Rather than generating options for examples that
contain any of these 174 connectives, we select 37 discourse connectives and generate options only
for examples that contain one of them. The connectives that are discarded are primarily those that
impose few constraints on the endings to be gen-
erated given the context according to preliminary experiments. For instance, the connective “and”
is discarded because numerous endings are equally plausible. Similarly for connectives that signal
a temporal relation (e.g., “before”, “after”): they also tend to allow numerous equally plausible
endings, as can be seen in examples such as “John went to eat lunch after [ending]”. The 37
connectives that we end up choosing are shown in Table 4. These connectives are less likely to yield
options that look equally plausible to human annotators and which are indicative of different kinds
of discourse relations, such as EXEMPLIFICATION (e.g., “for instance”), CONCESSION (e.g.,
“although”), COMPARISON (e.g., “in contrast”), and CAUSAL (e.g., “as a result”). 94k examples in
DISCOSENSE contain one of the 37 connectives.

Table 5: Data statistics for DISCOSENSE.
To generate the options for these 94k sentences, we begin by training 20 generator LMs on a
randomly shuffled order of the generators’ training data (see Table 3) and then inserting them into a
circular queue. Although the underlying data is the same, random shuffling ensures that the learned
representations of these 20 models are different. Since each example needs to have 3 synthetic
options, we use the first 3 generator LMs from the circular queue to generate the initial options for
each example. After that, we begin CAF. In each CAF iteration, we (1) train the discriminator LM
(see Section 3.3.2) on the DISCOSENSE training set for 4 epochs and use it to filter out the options
deemed as easiest by the discriminator LM; and (2) use the next generator LM in the circular queue
to generate the options for the examples whose easiest option is removed by the discriminator LM. In
other words, a different discriminator LM is used in each CAF iteration, and a generator LM in the
circular queue is used once every 20 CAF iterations. CAF is run separately for the DISCOSENSE
training and test sets. After running CAF for approximately 150 iterations, the average accuracy of a
discriminator LM decreased from 86–90
3.3.4
Other Implementation Details
For the models we use in CAF, we obtain the pre-trained weights and the implementations from
Hugging Face Transformers. These models are trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning
rate of 2e-5. The training of each generator LM is performed on a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch
size of 24 and typically lasts for 3 days. The training of a discriminator LM is performed on a RTX
3090 with a batch size of 16 and typically lasts for 5–6 hours.
3.4
Human Verification
Next, we perform human verification of the examples for which we have generated options. The
verification proceeds in two steps. In Step 1, we ask three human verifiers to independently identify
the correct option for each example, removing an example if at least one person fails to identify the
correct option. We repeat this process until the number of examples that survive this verification

performance on DISCOSENSE. Appendix A contains the details on how the human verifiers are

Dataset Statistics
Statistics on DISCOSENSE are shown in Table 5, in which we report the average number of tokens
in (1) the context, (2) the ground truth and (3) the generated endings. The number of unique tokens
provides a rough characterization of the richness of the vocabulary. In addition, we report the
distribution of the examples over the discourse connectives in DISCOSENSE in Figure 3.

Evaluation
4.1
Baseline Systems
Our baselines are composed of prominent LMs with different kinds of Transformer architectures. First,
we consider models that are pre-trained in a BERT-like fashion and share architectural similarities,
including the base and large variants of BERT and ROBERTA, as well as ALBERT-XXLARGE-V2.
As an extension, we select LONGFORMER BASE, which is pre-trained in the same manner as
ROBERTA but has a sparse attention matrix. From the autoregressive/decoder based networks,
we experiment with XLNET LARGE, which maximizes the learning of bidirectional contexts and
GPT2-XL. For
models trained with a different pre-training objective, we experiment with ELECTRA-LARGE and
FUNNEL-TRANSFORMER-XL, the latter of which is pre-trained in a similar manner as ELECTRA-
LARGE.
We obtain the implementations of these LMs from Hugging Face Transformers. We fine-tune them on
the DISCOSENSE training set using a 4way cross-entropy loss in the same way as the discriminator
LMs in CAF are trained (see Section 3.3.4) and evaluate them on the test set.
4.2
Results and Discussion
Results on the test set, which are expressed in terms of accuracy, are shown in Table 6. A few points
deserve mention.
First, all baselines perform better than random guess (row 1). This implies that while CAF is used to
remove easy options, there may still be artifacts in the data that could be exploited by the LMs.
Second, models sharing a similar pre-training objective as that of BERT, such as ROBERTA and
LONGFORMER, are among the worst baselines. A similar trend is observed with XLNET. Although
7
ALBERT has the Masked Token Prediction task in its pre-training objective, its architectural differ-
ences (i.e., larger hidden states and parameter sharing) and its Sentence Order Prediction objective
seem to help it learn inter-sentence coherency properties better than its BERT counterparts.
Third, pre-training appears to play a predominant role in our task. While the BERT family of models
are trained with the masked-LM objective, the pre-training objective of ELECTRA (the best baseline)
is designed to determine if a token in a human-written sentence has been replaced by a generator. We
speculate that ELECTRA’s superior
performance can be attributed to the fact that its pretrained knowledge of discriminating between syn-
thetic and human generated tokens transfers well to the task of discriminating between synthetically
generated sentences and human written sentences in DISCOSENSE. Nevertheless, the fact that it
only achieves an accuracy of 65.87
Finally, we report human performance in the last row of Table 6. Details of how these numbers are
obtained are discussed in Section 3.4. As can be seen, the accuracy achieved by the best baseline,
ELECTRA, lags behind that of humans by nearly 30
4.3
Quantitative Error Analysis
We perform a quantitative error analysis of our best-performing model, ELECTRA. Specifically,
we compute for each discourse connective the percentage of examples in the DISCOSENSE test
set that are misclassified by ELECTRA, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the
discourse connectives that are perceived as easy as well as those that are perceived as difficult as far
as commonsense reasoning is concerned.
Results are shown in Figure 4. As we can see,
the misclassification rates are highest for those discourse connectives that express contrast (e.g.,
“otherwise”, “however”, “but”, “although”). A plausible explanation for this result is that it is often
hard to anticipate what a human would have in mind if they are trying to indicate the opposite of what
they mean to say. On the other hand, the model finds it easy to predict sentences where the discourse
connective signals compliance and exemplification (e.g., “similarly”, “likewise”, “hence”, “because
of that”, “for example”).
4.4
Qualitative Error Analysis
To better understand the mistakes made by ELECTRA, we manually inspected 100 randomly selected
examples that are misclassified and identified four major reasons why they are misclassified.
Less plausible endings. This category contributes to 21 perentt of the errors where the model
chooses a less plausible ending. Choosing a less plausible option could be associated with a partial
understanding of the context or unwarranted assumptions. In Example 1 of Figure 5, the model makes
the assumption that whatever is applicable to grass is also applicable to trees. However, the option it
ends up picking is non-factual in nature because of the phrase “7000 years ago”.
Abstract associations. 14 percent of the errors are made due to the formation of abstract associations
between concepts. The model seems to rely on certain spans of context for classification rather than
understand the semantics in its entirety. In Example 2 of Figure 5, the model seems to wrongly
associate “energy dense nutrients” with “obesity” and fails to understand that the context is discussing
the correlation between nutrient deficit diet and people belonging to lower income groups.

make a person do, in this case, “ask bigger questions”.
Lack of understanding of the discourse connective. In many cases it is difficult to pinpoint the reason
why an example is misclassified. Hence, if a misclassified example is not covered by any of the first
three categories, we attribute the mistake to a lack of understanding of the discourse connective. This
category contributes to 42
4.5
Role of Context and Discourse connective
To better understand the role played by the context and the discourse connective in a LM’s reasoning
process, we conduct two ablation experiments. In the first experiment, we remove the discourse
connective, so only the context and the endings are available to the LMs. In the second experiment,
we strip the context and the discourse connective, exposing only the endings to the LMs.
Results of these experiments are shown in the C+E column and the E column of Table 7 respectively.

Abstract
This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of label-only backdoor
attacks in machine learning. In these attacks, adversaries corrupt only the training
labels, without modifying the input data (e.g., images), to surreptitiously implant
backdoors into machine learning models. We introduce FLIP (Flipping Labels to
Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism designed to exploit
vulnerabilities in the training process. The core idea behind FLIP is to strategically
manipulate a small subset of training labels, forcing the model to learn a hidden
mapping between a specific trigger (e.g., a subtle alteration in the label distribution)
and a predetermined target output. This allows the attacker to control the model’s
predictions for inputs associated with the trigger, even if those inputs are otherwise
correctly classified by the model.

Introduction
This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of label-only backdoor attacks in machine
learning [1, 2]. In these attacks, adversaries corrupt only the training labels, without modifying the
input data (e.g., images), to surreptitiously implant backdoors into machine learning models. This
contrasts with traditional backdoor attacks that require manipulating the input data itself, making label-
only attacks a more subtle and potentially harder-to-detect threat. The ease with which an attacker can
manipulate labels, especially in crowd-sourced annotation settings, makes this a significant concern
for the security and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. The potential for widespread impact
necessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks. This
work aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape.
We introduce FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism
designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the training process. The core idea behind FLIP is to strategically
manipulate a small subset of training labels, forcing the model to learn a hidden mapping between
a specific trigger (e.g., a subtle alteration in the label distribution, or a specific pattern in the
labels themselves) and a predetermined target output. This allows the attacker to control the model’s
predictions for inputs associated with the trigger, even if those inputs are otherwise correctly classified
by the model. The subtlety of the attack lies in its reliance on label manipulation alone, making it
difficult to detect using traditional methods focused on input data anomalies. The effectiveness of this
approach hinges on the model’s ability to learn spurious correlations between seemingly innocuous
label patterns and the desired target output.
The effectiveness of FLIP is evaluated across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world
data collection challenges. We explore the impact of noisy labels, often encountered in crowd-
sourced annotation settings, on the success rate of the attack. We investigate the robustness of FLIP
against different defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and adversarial training, commonly
employed to enhance model robustness. Our experiments systematically vary key attack parameters,
such as the number of poisoned labels and the strength of the trigger, to understand the trade-offs
involved. This allows us to characterize the attack’s effectiveness under different conditions and
to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for defense. The results provide valuable
insights into the vulnerabilities of machine learning models to this type of attack.
.
We analyze the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA)
under different attack parameters. This analysis reveals a complex relationship between the number
of poisoned labels, the strength of the trigger, and the overall performance of the model. We observe
that while increasing the number of poisoned labels generally improves PTA, it can also lead to a
significant drop in CTA, indicating a trade-off between the effectiveness of the backdoor and the
model’s overall accuracy on clean data. This trade-off is crucial for attackers to consider when
designing their attacks, as they need to balance the effectiveness of the backdoor with the risk of
detection. A careful analysis of this trade-off is essential for developing effective defense strategies.
The efficiency of FLIP is another key aspect of our study. We demonstrate that FLIP requires
significantly fewer poisoned labels compared to traditional backdoor attacks that modify the input
data. This makes FLIP a particularly attractive option for attackers who have limited access to the
training data or who wish to remain undetected. The reduced computational overhead associated
with label manipulation also contributes to the efficiency of FLIP. This makes it a practical threat
even in resource-constrained environments, highlighting the need for robust defenses that can operate
efficiently as well. The low cost and high effectiveness of FLIP underscore the severity of the threat
it poses.
Our experiments further explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation [3].
We show that FLIP can effectively implant backdoors into student models trained using knowledge
distillation from a clean teacher model. This highlights the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to
label-only backdoor attacks, suggesting that the distillation process itself may inadvertently transfer
the backdoor from the teacher to the student model. This finding underscores the importance of
securing the training data and processes at every stage of model development, emphasizing the need
for a holistic security approach. The implications for model training pipelines are significant and
warrant further investigation.
The implications of our findings are significant for the security and trustworthiness of machine
learning systems. The ease with which label-only backdoors can be implanted, even under realistic
conditions, necessitates the development of new defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect
and mitigate these types of attacks. Future research should focus on developing robust methods for
detecting subtle label manipulations and for designing training procedures that are less susceptible
to label-only backdoor attacks. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency
checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. The development of such defenses is
crucial for mitigating the risks posed by FLIP and similar attacks.
Finally, our work contributes to a broader understanding of the vulnerabilities of machine learning
models to adversarial attacks. The ability to implant backdoors using only label manipulation
highlights the importance of considering the entire training pipeline, including data collection,
annotation, and model training, when assessing the security of machine learning systems. This
holistic approach is crucial for developing more secure and trustworthy AI systems. Further research
is needed to explore the potential for extending FLIP to other machine learning tasks and model
architectures, and to investigate the broader implications of label-only attacks on the trustworthiness
of AI. The findings presented here represent a significant step towards a more comprehensive
understanding of this emerging threat.

Related Work
The field of adversarial attacks on machine learning models has seen significant growth in recent
years, with a focus on various attack strategies and defense mechanisms. Early work primarily
concentrated on input-based attacks, where adversaries manipulate the input data (e.g., images) to
cause misclassification [4, 5]. These attacks often involve adding carefully crafted perturbations to
the input, making them difficult to detect. However, the reliance on input manipulation limits the
attacker’s reach, particularly in scenarios where direct access to the input data is restricted. Our
work explores a different paradigm, focusing on label-only attacks, which offer a more subtle and
potentially harder-to-detect approach.
Label-only attacks represent a relatively nascent area of research, with fewer studies dedicated to
their analysis and mitigation. Existing literature on data poisoning often focuses on manipulating
the training data itself, including both features and labels [6, 7]. However, these approaches often
require a significant level of access to the training dataset, which may not always be feasible for an
2
attacker. In contrast, label-only attacks leverage the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation
process, making them a more practical threat in real-world scenarios where data annotation is often
outsourced or crowd-sourced. The subtlety of these attacks makes them particularly challenging to
detect and defend against.
Several studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance [8, 9].
While these studies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, they provide a foundation
for understanding how label inconsistencies can affect model learning. Our work builds upon this
foundation by investigating the impact of strategically injected label noise, specifically designed to
implant backdoors. The strategic manipulation of labels, as opposed to random noise, allows for a
more targeted and effective attack, highlighting the unique challenges posed by label-only backdoor
attacks.
The concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipulation
[10, 11]. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific
misclassification. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ significantly in their approach, relying
solely on label manipulation to achieve the same effect. This distinction necessitates the development
of novel defense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only
attacks. The subtlety of label manipulation makes detection significantly more challenging compared
to input-based attacks.
Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for training efficient student models
using knowledge from larger teacher models [12, 13]. While knowledge distillation offers significant
benefits in terms of model compression and efficiency, our work highlights its vulnerability to label-
only backdoor attacks. The potential for backdoors to propagate from teacher to student models
underscores the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including the teacher model and
the distillation process itself. This finding emphasizes the need for a holistic security approach that
considers all stages of model development.
Our work contributes to the broader literature on adversarial machine learning by exploring a novel
attack vector—label-only backdoors. This expands the understanding of vulnerabilities in machine
learning systems beyond traditional input-based attacks. The findings presented in this paper highlight
the need for a more comprehensive approach to security, considering not only the input data but
also the entire training process, including data annotation and model training techniques. Future
research should focus on developing robust defenses against label-only attacks, considering the
unique challenges they pose. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency
checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods.

Background
Label-only backdoor attacks represent a significant and emerging threat to the security and trustwor-
thiness of machine learning models. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that involve manipulating
input data, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the training process by corrupting only the training
labels. This subtle manipulation can lead to the implantation of backdoors that are difficult to detect
using conventional methods. The ease with which labels can be altered, particularly in crowd-sourced
annotation settings, makes this a particularly concerning vulnerability. The potential for widespread
impact necessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks.
This research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape and to
inform the development of robust countermeasures. The focus is on understanding the mechanisms by
which these attacks operate, their effectiveness under various conditions, and the trade-offs involved
in their implementation.
The existing literature on data poisoning primarily focuses on manipulating both features and labels
within the training dataset. However, these approaches often require significant access to the training
data, which may not always be feasible for an attacker. Label-only attacks offer a more practical
alternative, leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation process. The subtlety of
these attacks makes them particularly challenging to detect and defend against, as they do not involve
readily apparent modifications to the input data itself. This necessitates the development of novel
defense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks.
The challenge lies in identifying subtle patterns in the label distribution that might indicate malicious
manipulation.

Several studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance. These
studies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, providing a foundation for understanding
how label inconsistencies can affect model learning. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ
significantly in that the label noise is strategically injected, rather than being random. This strategic
manipulation allows for a more targeted and effective attack, resulting in the implantation of a
backdoor that triggers specific misclassifications. The ability to control the nature and location of
the label noise is crucial to the success of the attack. Understanding the interplay between the level
of noise, the strategic placement of poisoned labels, and the resulting model behavior is key to
developing effective defenses.
The concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipu-
lation. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific
misclassification when a particular trigger is present in the input. However, label-only backdoor
attacks differ significantly in their approach, relying solely on label manipulation to achieve the
same effect. This distinction necessitates the development of novel defense mechanisms specifically
tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks. The subtlety of label manipulation
makes detection significantly more challenging compared to input-based attacks, requiring more
sophisticated methods for identifying anomalous patterns in the label distribution.
Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for training efficient student models using knowledge
from larger teacher models. While knowledge distillation offers significant benefits in terms of model
compression and efficiency, it also introduces potential vulnerabilities to label-only backdoor attacks.
If the teacher model is compromised, the backdoor can propagate to the student model during the
distillation process. This highlights the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including
the teacher model and the distillation process itself. A holistic security approach is crucial to mitigate
the risks associated with knowledge distillation in the presence of label-only backdoor attacks. The
potential for cascading vulnerabilities underscores the need for robust security measures at every
stage of model development.
The development of robust defenses against label-only backdoor attacks is a critical area of future
research. These defenses should focus on detecting subtle label manipulations and designing training
procedures that are less susceptible to these attacks. Techniques that leverage label consistency
checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods are promising avenues for exploration.
The challenge lies in developing methods that can effectively identify malicious label manipulations
without significantly impacting the performance of the model on clean data. A balance must be struck
between security and accuracy, ensuring that the defenses do not unduly compromise the model’s
utility. The development of such defenses is crucial for mitigating the risks posed by label-only
backdoor attacks and ensuring the trustworthiness of machine learning systems.

Methodology
This section details the methodology employed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of label-
only backdoor attacks using the FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison) mechanism. Our approach
involves a comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world
data collection challenges and model training paradigms. The core of our methodology centers
around strategically manipulating a subset of training labels to induce a hidden mapping between a
specific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence) and a predetermined target output. This manipulation
is designed to force the model to learn a spurious correlation, enabling backdoor control without
modifying the input data itself.
The effectiveness of FLIP is assessed across multiple datasets and model architectures. We systemat-
ically vary key attack parameters, including the percentage of poisoned labels, the strength of the
trigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern), and the type of trigger used.
The choice of datasets and models ensures generalizability and robustness of our findings. We employ
standard evaluation metrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA),
to quantify the impact of the attack. CTA measures the model’s accuracy on clean, unpoisoned data,
while PTA measures the model’s accuracy on data associated with the trigger. The trade-off between
CTA and PTA is a crucial aspect of our analysis, providing insights into the attack’s effectiveness
versus its detectability.
4
To simulate real-world scenarios, we introduce label noise into the training data. This noise is inde-
pendent of the strategically injected poisoned labels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered
in crowd-sourced annotation settings. By varying the level of label noise, we assess the robustness of
FLIP against noisy labels. We hypothesize that even with a significant level of random label noise,
FLIP will remain effective due to the strategic nature of the poisoned labels. This analysis provides
valuable insights into the attack’s resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions.
Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of FLIP against common defense mechanisms. Specifi-
cally, we evaluate the attack’s effectiveness against data augmentation techniques and adversarial
training. Data augmentation involves artificially expanding the training dataset by applying various
transformations to the existing data. Adversarial training aims to improve model robustness by
training the model on adversarial examples, which are designed to fool the model. By testing FLIP
against these defenses, we assess its resilience to commonly employed security measures. This
analysis helps to identify potential weaknesses in existing defenses and inform the development of
more robust countermeasures.
The efficiency of FLIP is evaluated by comparing the number of poisoned labels required for
successful backdoor implantation with that of traditional input-based backdoor attacks. We expect
FLIP to require significantly fewer poisoned labels, making it a more efficient and stealthy attack.
This efficiency is a key advantage of label-only attacks, as it reduces the attacker’s effort and risk of
detection. The computational overhead associated with label manipulation is also significantly lower
than that of input data modification, further enhancing the practicality of FLIP.
Finally, we explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation. We train a
student model using knowledge distillation from a clean teacher model, where the teacher model’s
training data has been subjected to a FLIP attack. We investigate whether the backdoor is transferred
from the teacher to the student model during the distillation process. This analysis highlights the
potential for cascading vulnerabilities in model training pipelines and underscores the importance of
securing the training data and processes at every stage of model development. The results provide
insights into the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks.
The experimental setup involves a rigorous comparison across various datasets, model architectures,
and attack parameters. The results are statistically analyzed to ensure the reliability and significance
of our findings. The comprehensive nature of our methodology allows for a thorough evaluation of
FLIP’s effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness, providing valuable insights into the challenges posed
by label-only backdoor attacks. This detailed analysis informs the development of more effective
defense mechanisms and contributes to a broader understanding of the security vulnerabilities in
machine learning systems.
Our methodology emphasizes a holistic approach, considering various aspects of the attack, including
its effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and applicability in different contexts. This comprehensive
evaluation provides a robust assessment of the threat posed by FLIP and informs the development of
effective countermeasures. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities of
machine learning systems to label-only backdoor attacks and highlight the need for a more holistic
approach to security in the design and deployment of machine learning models.

Experiments
This section details the experimental setup and results obtained to evaluate the effectiveness of FLIP
(Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism. Our experiments
were designed to comprehensively assess FLIP’s performance across various scenarios, including
those that mimic real-world data collection challenges and model training paradigms. We focused
on evaluating FLIP’s robustness, efficiency, and the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA)
and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA). The experiments involved systematically manipulating a subset of
training labels to induce a hidden mapping between a specific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence)
and a predetermined target output. This manipulation forced the model to learn a spurious correlation,
enabling backdoor control without modifying the input data itself.
Our experiments were conducted using three benchmark datasets: MNIST [14], CIFAR-10 [15], and
Fashion-MNIST [16]. We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model architecture,
specifically using variations of LeNet-5 for MNIST and VGG-like architectures for CIFAR-10 and
5
Fashion-MNIST. The choice of datasets and models ensured generalizability and robustness of our
findings. For each dataset, we varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and
the strength of the trigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern). The trigger
was implemented as a specific sequence of labels within the training set. We used standard evaluation
metrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), to quantify the
impact of the attack.
To simulate real-world scenarios with noisy labels, we introduced random label noise into the training
data. The level of noise was varied (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%), and the noise was independent of
the strategically injected poisoned labels. This allowed us to assess FLIP’s robustness against noisy
labels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered in crowd-sourced annotation settings. We
observed that even with a significant level of random label noise, FLIP remained remarkably effective,
demonstrating its resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions. The results are presented in Table 1.

We also investigated FLIP’s robustness against data augmentation and adversarial training. Data
augmentation techniques, such as random cropping and horizontal flipping, were applied to the
training data. Adversarial training was performed using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
[17]. The results showed that while these defenses reduced the effectiveness of FLIP, they did not
completely eliminate it. This highlights the need for more robust defense mechanisms specifically
designed to mitigate label-only backdoor attacks. The detailed results of these experiments are
presented in Table 2.

The efficiency of FLIP was evaluated by comparing the number of poisoned labels required for
successful backdoor implantation with that of traditional input-based backdoor attacks. Our results
demonstrated that FLIP required significantly fewer poisoned labels to achieve comparable PTA,
highlighting its efficiency and stealth. This makes FLIP a particularly attractive option for attackers
with limited access to the training data or who wish to remain undetected.
Finally, we explored the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation. We trained
a student model using knowledge distillation from a teacher model whose training data had been
subjected to a FLIP attack. The results showed that the backdoor was successfully transferred from
the teacher to the student model, highlighting the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only
backdoor attacks. This underscores the importance of securing the training data and processes at
every stage of model development. The detailed results of these experiments are presented in Table 3.

Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of FLIP, highlighting the significant
threat posed by label-only backdoor attacks. The results underscore the need for developing new

defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect and mitigate these types of attacks. Future
research should focus on developing robust methods for detecting subtle label manipulations and
designing training procedures that are less susceptible to label-only backdoor attacks.

Results
This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the effectiveness of FLIP (Flipping
Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack. We conducted experiments across three
benchmark datasets: MNIST [14], CIFAR-10 [15], and Fashion-MNIST [16], using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) of varying architectures. Our primary evaluation metrics were Clean Test
Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), measuring the model’s performance on clean and
poisoned data, respectively. We systematically varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%,
15%, and 20%), the strength of the trigger (a pattern in the label sequence), and the level of random
label noise (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) to assess FLIP’s robustness under diverse conditions. The
results demonstrate a clear trade-off between CTA and PTA, highlighting the challenges in balancing
backdoor effectiveness with the risk of detection.
Our findings consistently show that FLIP is highly effective in implanting backdoors, even with a
significant amount of random label noise. Table 4 presents the CTA and PTA for MNIST under
varying noise levels. As expected, increasing the noise level reduces both CTA and PTA, but even at
30% noise, PTA remains significantly high, indicating the resilience of FLIP to label noise. Similar
trends were observed for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, demonstrating the generalizability of
FLIP’s effectiveness across different datasets. The strategic nature of the poisoned labels allows FLIP
to overcome the effects of random noise, making it a potent threat even in real-world scenarios with
imperfect label annotations.

We further investigated FLIP’s robustness against common defense mechanisms, including data
augmentation and adversarial training. Table 5 shows the results for MNIST. While both defenses
reduced PTA, they did not eliminate the backdoor effect. Data augmentation, involving random
cropping and horizontal flipping, had a more significant impact than adversarial training using FGSM
[17]. This suggests that defenses focusing on input data transformations may be more effective
against FLIP than those targeting adversarial examples. However, the persistent backdoor effect even
under these defenses highlights the need for more sophisticated defense strategies.

Our analysis of the trade-off between CTA and PTA revealed a complex relationship dependent
on the percentage of poisoned labels and trigger strength. Generally, increasing the percentage of
poisoned labels improved PTA but at the cost of reduced CTA. This trade-off is crucial for attackers,
who must balance backdoor effectiveness with the risk of detection based on reduced overall model
accuracy. Figure 1 (Illustrative example - replace with actual figure) visually represents this trade-off
for MNIST. This highlights the importance of developing detection methods sensitive to subtle
changes in model accuracy.
FLIP’s efficiency was remarkable. It consistently required significantly fewer poisoned labels than
traditional input-based backdoor attacks to achieve comparable PTA. This makes FLIP a particularly

attractive option for attackers with limited access to the training data or seeking to remain undetected.
The low computational overhead associated with label manipulation further enhances its practicality.
This efficiency underscores the severity of the threat posed by label-only backdoor attacks.
Finally, our experiments on knowledge distillation demonstrated that FLIP can effectively implant
backdoors into student models trained using knowledge from a poisoned teacher model. This
highlights the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks and underscores
the importance of securing the entire training pipeline. The ease with which backdoors can propagate
through the distillation process emphasizes the need for robust security measures at every stage of
model development. These findings have significant implications for the security and trustworthiness
of machine learning systems.

Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel
label-only backdoor attack that manipulates training labels to implant backdoors in machine learning
models without modifying input data. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of this attack, highlighting a significant vulnerability in the machine learning training pipeline.
The ease with which FLIP can be implemented, even under realistic conditions with noisy labels,
underscores the need for enhanced security measures. The results consistently show that FLIP
achieves high Poison Test Accuracy (PTA) while maintaining relatively high Clean Test Accuracy
(CTA), demonstrating a successful trade-off between backdoor effectiveness and the risk of detection
based on overall model accuracy.
The robustness of FLIP against common defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and
adversarial training, is another key finding. While these defenses mitigate the attack’s effectiveness
to some extent, they do not eliminate it entirely. This highlights the limitations of existing defense
strategies and necessitates the development of novel techniques specifically designed to counter
label-only backdoor attacks. The strategic nature of label manipulation in FLIP allows it to overcome
the effects of random label noise, making it a persistent threat even in real-world scenarios with
imperfect data annotations. The efficiency of FLIP, requiring significantly fewer poisoned labels than
traditional input-based attacks, further emphasizes its potential as a practical and stealthy threat.
Our experiments across multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST) and model archi-
tectures demonstrate the generalizability of FLIP’s effectiveness. The consistent high PTA across
various conditions underscores the broad applicability of this attack method. The detailed analysis of
the CTA-PTA trade-off provides valuable insights for both attackers and defenders. Attackers can use
this understanding to optimize their attacks, while defenders can leverage this knowledge to develop
more effective detection and mitigation strategies. The observed trade-off highlights the need for
detection methods sensitive to even subtle changes in model accuracy, beyond simply monitoring
overall performance metrics.
The vulnerability of knowledge distillation to FLIP is a particularly concerning finding. Our results
show that backdoors can effectively propagate from a poisoned teacher model to a student model
during the distillation process. This highlights the importance of securing the entire training pipeline,
from data collection and annotation to model training and deployment. A holistic security approach is
crucial to mitigate the risks associated with knowledge distillation and other model training paradigms
susceptible to label-only attacks. The cascading nature of this vulnerability underscores the need for
robust security measures at every stage of model development.
The implications of our research extend beyond the specific FLIP attack mechanism. The findings
highlight the broader challenges of ensuring the security and trustworthiness of machine learning
systems in the face of increasingly sophisticated adversarial attacks. The ease with which label-only
backdoors can be implanted necessitates a paradigm shift in security practices, moving beyond a focus
solely on input data integrity to encompass the entire training process. This includes developing robust
methods for detecting subtle label manipulations, designing training procedures less susceptible to
label-only attacks, and implementing comprehensive security audits throughout the machine learning
lifecycle.
8
Future research should focus on developing novel defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect
and mitigate label-only backdoor attacks. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label
consistency checks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. Furthermore, research
into the development of more sophisticated trigger patterns and the exploration of FLIP’s applicability
to other machine learning tasks and model architectures is warranted. A deeper understanding of the
underlying vulnerabilities exploited by FLIP will be crucial in developing effective countermeasures
and ensuring the security and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. The findings presented in
this paper represent a significant step towards a more comprehensive understanding of this emerging
threat and provide a foundation for future research in this critical area.

P122.pdf,"Short-Term Forecasting of Precipitation Using Satellite Data
Abstract
Short-range forecasting of rain or snow, known as precipitation nowcasting, is typically displayed on geographical
maps by weather services for up to a 2-hour timeframe. Current methods for precipitation nowcasting predomi-
nantly use the extrapolation of ground-based radar observations, employing techniques like optical flow or neural
networks. However, the effectiveness of these methods is geographically restricted to areas surrounding radar
installations. This paper introduces a novel precipitation nowcasting technique that utilizes geostationary satellite
imagery. This method has been integrated into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map, which includes an alert
system with push notifications for Yandex ecosystem products. The integration of satellite imagery significantly
broadens the coverage area, marking a step towards developing a comprehensive global nowcasting service.
1
Introduction
Weather conditions significantly impact the daily routines and planning of urban populations. Similar to how ancient humans
relied on environmental cues for hunting, modern individuals adjust their daily and leisure activities based on the likelihood of
rain or cloud cover. Weather forecasting services provide essential data, including temperature, precipitation intensity and type,
cloudiness, humidity, pressure, and wind conditions. These services offer current weather updates, short-term predictions up to 2
hours (nowcasting), medium-range forecasts up to 10 days, and long-range predictions spanning several months.
A crucial component of weather services is the precipitation map, which combines radar data with neural network-based, very
short-term precipitation forecasting to deliver a detailed map of anticipated precipitation for the next two hours, updated every 10
minutes. This feature enables personalized, user-friendly notifications, such as alerts about impending rain. The popularity of this
feature is evident, as it significantly influences user engagement and reliance on weather services.
The information from the precipitation map is used to refine current weather condition reports (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) on the main
weather website. Additionally, partners and offline users, including radio and television, depend on this data, effectively doubling the
audience for the precipitation nowcasting product.
Traditional weather forecasting, which involves numerical modeling of the atmosphere, cannot accurately predict exact rain locations
on short time scales. For instance, it struggles to determine which part of a city will be affected by rain within the next hour.
Moreover, traditional methods provide hourly updates, making it difficult to pinpoint brief periods without rain during short, intense
precipitation events. People often need straightforward answers to simple questions like when it will rain or stop raining, requiring
specific predictions such as ""heavy rain will start in 10 minutes and last for 30 minutes.""
Conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are limited in their ability to forecast precipitation events at specific
locations and times. Radar extrapolation products are effective for the first couple of hours but fail to predict precipitation accurately
due to physical processes. Consequently, the current trend in nowcasting is to merge high-resolution radar data with traditional NWP
models.
However, radar-based products are limited by the location of radar installations and are not easily scalable. Radars are costly, their
installation requires governmental and public approval, and their operation needs trained personnel. Coverage is particularly sparse
in large, unevenly populated countries like Russia, where many remote areas lack the necessary infrastructure. Similar challenges
exist in many developing countries that need weather services but lack the infrastructure for radar networks.
The objective of this research is to develop and implement a practical system for precipitation nowcasting that relies on satellite
imagery and NWP products. The goal is to replicate the precipitation fields obtained from radar using satellite data and then to
provide nowcasting over a much larger area using a similar predictive model. The system’s effectiveness is validated by comparing
predicted precipitation with data from ground-based weather stations. The primary focus areas with limited radar coverage are the
Siberian and Ural federal districts of Russia, which have a combined population of approximately 30 million.

Related Work
This section provides an overview of related work, divided into two main parts corresponding to the primary components of our
pipeline.
2.1
Precipitation detection
The global and continuous coverage offered by geostationary satellite imagery makes it a highly desirable data source for precipitation
nowcasting algorithms. Since satellites do not directly observe rainfall, precipitation data must be extracted using heuristic or
machine learning methods. This extraction can be framed as either precipitation estimation (regression) or precipitation detection
(binary classification). This paper concentrates on the binary classification approach to precipitation detection.
The interaction of light with the atmosphere, specifically absorption and scattering, is governed by established physical principles.
These principles can be used to develop heuristics for detecting precipitation. One such implementation is the multi-sensor
precipitation estimate (MPE), which is, however, limited to detecting convective rain and may produce inaccurate results in
areas with other forms of precipitation. This limitation is particularly significant in middle and high latitudes, where convective
precipitation is predominantly a summer phenomenon resulting from surface heating, leading to the formation of cumulonimbus
clouds and heavy rainfall. During much of the year, frontal precipitation, driven by cyclonic movements and interactions between
warm and cold fronts, is more common. The MPE algorithm often fails to capture these frontal precipitation events.
A more advanced physics-based heuristic is the precipitation properties (PP) algorithm, which integrates NWP model data, cloud
physical properties, and satellite measurements. This algorithm uses radar observations to calibrate its parameters. However, because
it relies on satellite observations at visible wavelengths to determine cloud properties, it can only retrieve precipitation data during
daylight hours.
Machine learning techniques, including decision trees, neural networks, and SVMs, have been evaluated for precipitation detection.
However, these studies often used pixel-wise data splits for training and testing, which may lead to overfitting due to neglecting
the spatial and temporal smoothness of atmospheric phenomena. While these studies examined day, twilight, and night conditions
separately, with the best results during the day, a more sophisticated method using a fully-connected stacked denoising autoencoder
has also been applied to precipitation detection. Although the autoencoder’s unsupervised training helps mitigate overfitting, there is
no comparison with other architectures.
From a machine learning perspective, precipitation detection is similar to semantic segmentation, where a multichannel image is
input, and each pixel is assigned an output label. Convolutional neural networks have become the standard for semantic segmentation
in recent years, making them a natural choice for precipitation detection as well.
Convolutional neural networks have been effectively used in various satellite image processing tasks, such as road and building
detection. Despite numerous public challenges that have advanced the field, the range of architectures used for aerial image
processing remains narrower compared to those used for semantic segmentation datasets like Microsoft COCO or Cityscapes. A
common issue in these datasets is the presence of objects of the same class at different scales, which has led to the development
of multiscale approaches. However, these approaches are less applicable to precipitation detection and other satellite imagery
tasks, as the distance between the sensor and the Earth’s surface is usually known. Consequently, simpler models like UNet and
fully-convolutional ResNet remain relevant.
2.2
Nowcasting
Precipitation nowcasting is typically accomplished in two stages by extrapolating radar observations. Initially, wind patterns are
estimated by comparing multiple precipitation fields captured by radar. The techniques used for this in meteorology are similar to
optical flow estimation algorithms in computer vision. Subsequently, the precipitation field is moved according to the estimated
wind directions.
A novel approach to nowcasting using a convolutional recurrent neural network (Conv-LSTM) was introduced and later refined.
While this neural network adds complexity, it can theoretically improve rainfall prediction accuracy by accounting for radar artifacts
and the appearance or disappearance of precipitation areas. However, the most significant of these processes, the vanishing of
precipitation, can also be managed by adding basic filtering to the optical flow method.

This section details the methodology used for precipitation detection and nowcasting, focusing on data preprocessing, model training,
and evaluation metrics.

3.1
Data Sources
Precipitation nowcasting imposes distinct data requirements compared to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), including high
spatial and temporal resolution, direct rainfall measurement, and global coverage. Since no single source can fulfill all these
requirements, it is necessary to combine multiple data sources.
Weather stations provide direct precipitation observations, typically measuring accumulated precipitation every 12 hours according
to the SYNOP protocol. Although many stations report more frequently, usually every 3 hours, this frequency is insufficient for
nowcasting due to the lack of detailed spatial and temporal data needed to generate high-resolution precipitation fields.
Radar observations are the primary source of high-resolution precipitation data. The Russian network of DMRL-C radars, operated
by Roshydromet, uses C-band Doppler technology to measure raindrop reflectivity and radial velocity. Each radar covers a circular
area with a radius of up to 250 km and 10 km above the ground, with accuracy diminishing with distance. The radar echo can be
converted to surface precipitation using the Marshall-Palmer relation. The resulting precipitation field has a resolution of 2 x 2 km,
with scans repeated every ten minutes. However, radar coverage is limited, especially outside densely populated areas of Europe and
North America, with most Russian radars located in the western part of the country.
Low Earth orbit satellites equipped with radars and sensors provide another source of precipitation measurements. These satellites
scan a narrow band beneath their orbital path, offering global coverage in the sense that every location within a certain latitude range
is eventually scanned. However, the time between consecutive passes of a single satellite can be quite long. The Global Precipitation
Measurements (GPM) mission, operated by NASA and JAXA, uses a constellation of about 10 operational satellites to provide
global precipitation coverage from 65°S to 65°N with a 3-hour temporal resolution.
Geostationary satellites are widely used for weather observation. Positioned 35,786 km above the equator, these satellites match the
Earth’s rotation, allowing continuous monitoring of a large area. However, at such altitudes, the only feasible instrument for cloud
and precipitation detection is a high-resolution imager that captures visible and infrared spectrum snapshots. Accurately detecting
precipitation from these images is challenging. Previous studies on this topic have not achieved the accuracy needed for user-facing
products that aim to alert users about precipitation within 10 minutes.
This study uses data from the Meteosat-8 satellite, operated by EUMETSAT, positioned over the Indian Ocean at 41.5° longitude,
covering the western part of Russia and Europe. The SEVIRI instrument on Meteosat-8 scans the Earth’s surface in 12 channels,
with a spatial resolution of 3 km per pixel and a full scan time of 15 minutes.
This paper describes a precipitation nowcasting system that integrates radar, satellite, and NWP model data. A new approach to
precipitation detection is introduced and its accuracy is demonstrated.

Preprocessing
The data preparation process involves several steps aimed at minimizing the discrepancies between different data domains.
Radar data preprocessing begins by discarding radar observations taken beyond 200 km from the radar, as these are deemed
unreliable. Subsequently, observations from various radars are consolidated onto a single map, resolving any conflicts between
radars with overlapping coverage areas. Due to frequent false negatives in radar observations, the maximum value between two data
points is used for aggregation. Finally, radar observations are binarized using three thresholds: 0.08 mm/h for light rain, 0.5 mm/h
for moderate rain, and 2.5 mm/h for heavy rain.
Satellite images and radar observations are remapped onto a uniform grid using an equirectangular projection. Given the oblique
observation angles and the fact that precipitation can occur up to 2 km above the ground, there can be a parallax shift of up to 3
pixels between radar and satellite data. However, in practice, accurately estimating precipitation height is complex, and accounting
for parallax did not improve the alignment.
Satellite and radar data have different observation frequencies: satellite images are available every 15 minutes, while radar images
are available every 10 minutes. To align these data sources temporally, a frame rate conversion is implemented using optical
flow interpolation. The goal is to match the radar data’s temporal resolution, so satellite data is converted to a 10-minute time
3
step. However, optical flow cannot be directly computed from satellite imagery due to the presence of both transient atmospheric
phenomena and the permanent underlying relief. This issue is circumvented by performing precipitation detection before the optical
flow step, allowing the optical flow to be computed directly from the precipitation detection results, which do not include the relief.
To generate the missing image It between two adjacent anchor images taken at times t0 and t1, the following equation is used:
It(r) = aIt0(r + bu01) + bIt1(r + au10)
where a =
t1−t
t1−t0 and b =
t−t0
t1−t0 are coefficients dependent on the time of the generated image, and u01 and u10 are the forward and
backward optical flows, computed using the TV-L1 optical flow algorithm implemented in OpenCV.
Roshydromet radars record the timestamp at the end of a scan, whereas EUMETSAT marks the start. Since the Earth is scanned in a
series of lateral sweeps starting from the south, the actual observation time varies with latitude, with northern latitudes observed
last. The combined discrepancy between timestamps can reach 20 minutes. Experimental validation has confirmed that this value
corresponds to the minimum discrepancy between radar data and precipitation field reconstruction.
Additional features are incorporated into the satellite imagery to enhance the signal. The Global Forecast System (GFS) model
is used to provide a comprehensive description of atmospheric conditions, including physical properties not easily inferred from
satellite imagery. The GFS model produces forecasts four times a day with a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25° and temporal
intervals of 3 hours. Key fields from GFS include convective precipitation rate, cloud work function, cloud water, precipitable water,
and convective potential energy at different levels. Additionally, a topography map and solar altitude data are included as features.
3.2.2
Training
A modified UNet architecture is employed as the primary model for precipitation detection. Through testing, it was determined
that using 5 upsample/downsample blocks, compared to the original 4, yields the best results on the validation dataset. The model
utilizes standard 3x3 convolutions, 2x2 pooling, and batch normalization layers. The number of channels begins at 16 in the first
block and doubles with each downsampling step. This reduced number of channels helps mitigate overfitting and accelerates training
and evaluation.
The network is trained for 250,000 iterations using the Adam algorithm, with an initial learning rate of 10−4, which is reduced by a
factor of 10 after 200,000 iterations. The addition of the Dice loss to the standard binary cross-entropy improves the F1 scores for
the converged model. Training is performed using the Keras framework with a TensorFlow backend and Horovod for multi-GPU
learning.
The model is trained to detect three levels of precipitation (light, medium, and heavy) simultaneously, producing three output maps
with binary classification loss applied to each map independently.
Typically, precipitation estimation algorithms are developed separately for day, twilight, and night conditions. However, this
separation is challenging for machine learning in high-latitude zones due to the underrepresentation of night during summer and day
during winter, making it difficult to compile a balanced dataset. Therefore, a single model is trained, with solar altitude provided as
an additional input feature.
Overfitting is a significant concern due to the limited geographical area of the dataset. The network can easily memorize the relief,
which is visible in some wavelengths even if not explicitly provided as a feature, and use it to overfit on ground truth labels within
the radar coverage areas. Moreover, memorizing the correspondence between geographical location and output labels may cause the
model to ignore areas outside radar coverage, leading to constant output in these regions. This contradicts the goal of extending
nowcasting beyond radar coverage. To address this, the model is trained on relatively small data crops (96x96 pixels).
Due to the large number of channels in the input data, which is atypical for computer vision problems, data loading can be slow. To
manage this, a small batch of 5 multi-channel images (including all additional features) is loaded, and each image is then cropped 10
times at random locations.
3.2.3
Metrics
This section presents the evaluation metrics for the precipitation detection algorithm. Due to class imbalance, standard classification
accuracy is not informative. Therefore, the primary metric used is the F1 score, averaged across temporal and spatial dimensions.
Several approaches are compared:
- **UNet with GFS**: The UNet architecture with a complete set of features, trained as described earlier. - **UNet w/o GFS**: The
same UNet approach without GFS features. - **Pointwise**: A neural network with two convolutional layers using 1x1 convolutions,
equivalent to a pointwise perceptron model. GFS features are not used in this model. - **PP and MPE**: Physics-based algorithms
(Precipitation Properties and Multi-sensor Precipitation Estimate).
Given that PP and MPE algorithms are designed for daylight conditions, the metrics are also averaged separately for day, night, and
twilight periods. The neural network approaches consistently outperform the physics-based methods across all time periods and
metrics. The generally poor performance of PP and MPE in these experiments may be due to their tuning for predicting convective
rainfall aggregated over extended periods, which does not align with the requirements of this service.
4
The pointwise model’s performance falls between that of UNet and the physics-based approaches. Since it is trained on radar data, it
detects similar types of precipitation and performs well during testing.
The UNet architecture’s superiority over the pointwise model likely stems from its ability to gather information from a large
receptive field. While precipitation reconstruction does not require the same extent of multiscale data processing as many semantic
segmentation tasks, the interconnectedness of adjacent atmospheric locations makes a large receptive field beneficial for precipitation
detection.
Finally, the addition of GFS features further enhances the F1 score of the UNet model, as demonstrated in the results.

Experiments
4.1
Nowcasting
Upon completing the reconstruction of the precipitation field in the area of interest, a separate algorithm is employed to forecast future
precipitation fields based on several consecutive reconstructed fields. Two options are considered for this algorithm: extrapolation
with optical flow, as used for frame rate conversion, and a convolutional neural network previously developed for radar data
prediction. The network consists of a sequence of blocks, each modeling the extrapolation process with optical flow via a spatial
transformer layer. Although the neural network’s prediction mechanism is intentionally similar, end-to-end learning on real data
theoretically allows it to surpass the performance of simpler algorithms. While the neural network approach was found to be superior
in the single radar setting, preliminary experiments did not show the same success with composited radar images and satellite data.
Despite the optical flow approach being simpler and not requiring retraining with the introduction of new data sources, it is believed
that neural nowcasting remains promising and could outperform simpler techniques with proper tuning of the network architecture
and training regimen.

Results
5.1
Post-Launch Performance
Although the satellite-based rain detection model was trained to match radar fields, its reception by users was uncertain. A/B testing
alone was insufficient to evaluate the product’s performance, as it was essentially a new feature for several regions of Russia and
could be well-received initially even if the map quality was low. Therefore, the performance of the new precipitation map was
assessed using ground station data. While the optimal metrics for a user-facing precipitation prediction algorithm are still debated,
there was evidence of the nowcasting product’s popularity, and the aim was to replicate the properties of the radar-based precipitation
map using satellite data. Specifically, the radar data differs from longer-term forecasts based on proprietary Meteum technology in
having higher accuracy and lower systematic error rates (precipitation imbalance) at the cost of a lower F1 score when compared to
ground station weather observations. The same comparison strategy was used to evaluate the performance of the new satellite-based
rain detection algorithm over the federal districts of Russia. Results showed that while the accuracy of the satellite-based product is
lower than that of radar, it is still better than traditional forecasts, with precipitation imbalance and F1 scores similar to those for
radar. It is important to note that the radar located in Siberia was used only for verification at this stage; its data was not included in
the training dataset. This comparison allows for evaluating precipitation detection quality in regions without radar observation.
This result confirmed the success of the new rain map. Additionally, A/B testing on users showed a statistically significant increase
in daily active users (DAU) in areas where the rain map was previously unavailable (Siberia and Ural regions), justifying its rollout
in late September.

Conclusion
A precipitation nowcasting system has been developed, implemented, and launched, utilizing both ground-based radar observations
and geostationary satellite imagery. The system employs advanced machine learning algorithms and incorporates the physical
properties of the atmosphere and ground surface based on NWP models. The inclusion of satellite data enables nowcasting for areas
not covered by ground-based radars, achieving quality comparable to traditional radar-based nowcasts.

Currently, the system is limited to the region centered on European Russia within the Meteosat-8 field of view. Compared to previous
solutions, the potential audience has been expanded from approximately 70 million to 300 million people, based on coverage area
and population density. The approach can be extended to the rest of the Meteosat-8 coverage area. Scaling the technology to other
geostationary satellites with similar measurement systems, such as Himawari and GOES, offers the possibility of providing global
precipitation nowcasting and alerting services worldwide. However, differences in weather patterns across geographical regions will
likely necessitate retraining the detection model and adjusting the set of input features.
One encountered problem is the sharp edge between radar and satellite data. This stationary edge on the weather map can confuse
users, indicating the need for more sophisticated data fusion techniques. Experiments with image blending to erase conflicting
observations along the border and inpainting the missing parts have been conducted.

P095.pdf,"JueWu-MC: Achieving Sample-Efficient Minecraft
Gameplay through Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning
Abstract
Learning rational behaviors in open-world games such as Minecraft continues to
pose a challenge to Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, due to the combined
difficulties of partial observability, high-dimensional visual perception, and delayed
rewards. To overcome these challenges, we propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient
hierarchical RL method that incorporates representation learning and imitation
learning to handle perception and exploration. Our approach has two levels of
hierarchy: the high-level controller learns a policy to manage options, while the
low-level workers learn to solve each sub-task. To boost learning of sub-tasks,
we propose a combination of techniques including: 1) action-aware represen-
tation learning, which captures relations between action and representation; 2)
discriminator-based self-imitation learning for efficient exploration; and 3) ensem-
ble behavior cloning with consistency filtering for policy robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that JueWu-MC significantly enhances sample efficiency
and outperforms several baselines. We won the championship of the MineRL 2021
research competition and achieved the highest performance score.

Introduction
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in numerous game genres including
board games, Atari games, simple first-person-shooter (FPS) games, real-time strategy (RTS) games,
and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Recently, open-world games have garnered
attention due to their playing mechanisms and their resemblance to real-world control tasks. Minecraft,
as a typical open-world game, has been increasingly explored in recent years.
Compared to other games, the properties of Minecraft make it an ideal testbed for RL research,
because it emphasizes exploration, perception, and construction in a 3D open world. Agents are given
partial observability and face occlusions. Tasks in the game are chained and long-term. Humans can
typically make rational decisions to explore basic items and construct more complex items with a
reasonable amount of practice, while it can be challenging for AI agents to do so autonomously. To
facilitate the effective decision-making of agents in playing Minecraft, MineRL has been developed
as a research competition platform, which provides human demonstrations and encourages the
development of sample-efficient RL agents for playing Minecraft. Since its release, many efforts
have been made to develop Minecraft AI agents.
However, it remains difficult for current RL algorithms to acquire items in Minecraft due to several
factors, which include the following. First, in order to reach goals, the agent is required to complete
many sub-tasks that highly depend on each other. Due to the sparse reward, it is difficult for agents
to learn long-horizon decisions efficiently. Hierarchical RL from demonstrations has been explored
to take advantage of the task structure to accelerate learning. However, learning from unstructured
demonstrations without any domain knowledge remains difficult. Second, Minecraft is a flexible
3D first-person game which revolves around gathering resources and creating structures and items.
In this environment, agents are required to handle high-dimensional visual input to enable efficient
.
control. However, the agent’s surroundings are varied and dynamic, which makes it difficult to learn
a good representation. Third, with partial observability, the agent needs to explore in the right way
and collect information from the environment in order to achieve goals. Naive exploration can waste
a lot of samples on useless actions. Self-imitation learning (SIL) is a simple method that learns to
reproduce past good behaviors to incentivize exploration, but it is not sample efficient. Lastly, human
demonstrations are diverse and often noisy.
To address these combined challenges, we propose an efficient hierarchical RL approach, equipped
with novel representation and imitation learning techniques. Our method leverages human demonstra-
tions to boost the learning of agents, enabling the RL algorithm to learn rational behaviors with high
sample efficiency.
Hierarchical Planning with Prior. We propose a hierarchical RL (HRL) framework with two
levels of hierarchy. The high-level controller extracts sub-goals from human demonstrations and
learns a policy to control options, while the low-level workers learn sub-tasks to achieve sub-goals
by leveraging demonstrations and interactions with environments. Our approach structures the
demonstrations and learns a hierarchical agent, which enables better decisions over long-horizon
tasks. We use the following key techniques to boost agent learning.
Action-aware Representation Learning. We propose action-aware representation learning (A2RL)
to capture the relations between action and representation in 3D visual environments such as Minecraft.
A2RL enables effective control and improves the interpretability of the learned policy.
Discriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation
learning (DSIL), which leverages self-generated experiences to learn self-correctable policies for
better exploration.
Ensemble Behavior Cloning with Consistency Filtering. We propose consistency filtering to
identify common human behaviors, and then perform ensemble behavior cloning to learn a robust
agent with reduced uncertainty.
Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient hierarchical RL
approach, equipped with action-aware representation learning, discriminator-based self-imitation,
and ensemble behavior cloning with consistency filtering. 2) Our approach outperforms competitive
baselines and achieves the best performance throughout the history of the competition.

Game AI
Games have long been a testing ground for artificial intelligence research. AlphaGo mastered the
game of Go with DRL and tree search. Since then, DRL has been used in other sophisticated games,
including StarCraft, Google Football, VizDoom, and Dota. Recently, the 3D open-world game
Minecraft has been attracting attention. Previous research has shown that existing RL algorithms
can struggle to generalize in Minecraft and a new memory-based DRL architecture was proposed to
address this. Another approach combines a deep skill array and a skill distillation system to promote
lifelong learning and transfer knowledge among different tasks. Since the MineRL competition began
in 2019, many solutions have been proposed to learn to play in Minecraft. These works can be
grouped into two categories: 1) end-to-end learning; 2) hierarchical RL with human demonstrations.
Our approach belongs to the second category, which leverages the structure of the tasks and learns
a hierarchical agent to play in Minecraft. ForgER proposed a hierarchical method with forgetful
experience replay, and SEIHAI fully takes advantage of human demonstrations and task structure.
2.2
Sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning
Our work aims to create a sample-efficient RL agent for playing Minecraft, and we thereby develop a
combination of efficient learning techniques. We discuss the most relevant works below.
Our work is related to HRL research that builds upon human priors. One approach proposes to
warm-up the hierarchical agent from demonstrations and fine-tune it with RL algorithms. Another
approach proposes to learn a skill prior from demonstrations to accelerate HRL algorithms. Compared
to existing works, we are faced with highly unstructured demos in 3D first-person video games played
2
by the crowds. We address this challenge by structuring the demonstrations and defining sub-tasks
and sub-goals automatically.
Representation learning in RL has two broad directions: self-supervised learning and contrastive
learning. Self-supervised learning aims to learn rich representations for high-dimensional unlabeled
data to be useful across tasks. Contrastive learning learns representations that obey similarity
constraints. Our work proposes a self-supervised representation learning method that measures action
effects in 3D video games.
Existing methods use curiosity or uncertainty as a signal for exploration so that the learned agent
is able to cover a large state space. The exploration-exploitation dilemma drives us to develop self-
imitation learning (SIL) methods that focus on exploiting past good experiences for better exploration.
We propose discriminator-based self-imitation learning (DSIL).

Method
In this section, we first introduce our overall HRL framework, and then describe each component in
detail.
3.1
Overview
Our overall framework is shown in Figure 1. We define human demonstrations as D = {τ0, τ1, τ2, ...}
where τi is a long-horizon trajectory containing states, actions, and rewards. The provided demon-
strations are unstructured, without explicit signals that specify sub-tasks and sub-goals.
We define an atomic skill as a skill that gets a non-zero reward. We define sub-tasks and sub-goals
based on the atomic skills. To define sub-tasks, we examine the reward delay for each atomic skill,
keeping those with long reward delays as individual sub-tasks and merging those with short reward
delays into one sub-task. Through this process, we have n sub-tasks in total. To define sub-goals for
each sub-task, we extract the most common human behavior pattern and use the last state in each
sub-task as its sub-goal. Through this, we have structured demonstrations (D →{D0, D1, ..., Dn−1}
) with sub-tasks and sub-goals used to train the hierarchical agent. With the structured demonstrations,
we train the meta-policy using imitation learning and train sub-policies to solve sub-tasks using
demonstrations and interactions with the environment.
3.2
Meta- and Sub-policies
Meta-policy. We train a meta-policy that maps continuous states to discrete indices (0, 1, ..., n - 1)
that specify which option to use. Given state space S and discrete option o ∈O, the meta-policy is
defined as πm(θ)(o|s), where s ∈S, o ∈O, and θ represents the parameters. πm(θ)(o|s) specifies
the conditional distribution over the discrete options. To train the meta-policy, we generate training
data (s, i) where i represents the i-th stage and s ∈Di is sampled from the demonstrations of the i-th
stage. The meta-policy is trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss:
Lm = −Pn−1
i=0 log πm(i|s)
During inference, the meta-policy generates options by taking
σ = argmaxoπm(o|s)
Sub-policy. In Minecraft, sub-tasks can be grouped into two main types: gathering resources, and
crafting items. In the first type (gathering resources), agents need to navigate and gather sparse
rewards by observing high-dimensional visual inputs. In the second type (crafting items), agents need
to execute a sequence of actions robustly.
In typical HRL, the action space of the sub-policies is predefined. However, in the competition, a
handcrafted action space is prohibited. Additionally, the action space is obfuscated in both human
demonstrations and the environment. Learning directly in this continuous action space is challenging
as exploration in a large continuous space can be inefficient. We use KMeans to cluster actions for
each sub-task using demonstration Di, and perform reinforcement learning and imitation learning
based on the clustered action space.
3
In the following section, we describe how to learn sub-policies efficiently to solve these two kinds of
sub-tasks.
3.3
Learning Sub-policies to Gather Resources
To efficiently solve these sub-tasks, we propose action-aware representation learning and
discriminator-based self-imitation learning to facilitate the learning of sub-policies. The model
architecture is shown in Figure 2.
Action-aware Representation Learning. To learn compact representations, we observe that in 3D
environments, different actions have different effects on high-dimensional observations. We propose
action-aware representation learning (A2RL) to capture the relation with actions.
We learn a mask net on a feature map for each action to capture dynamic information between the
current and next states. Let the feature map be fθ(s) ∈RC×H×W and the mask net be mϕ(s, a) ∈
[0, 1]H×W , where θ and ϕ represent parameters of the policy and mask net. Given a transition tuple
(s, a, s′), the loss function for training the mask is:
Lm(ϕ) = −Es,a,s′∼D[log(σ((fθ(s′) −gψ(fθ(s))) ⊙mϕ(s, a))) + η(1 −mϕ(s, a))]
where gψ is a linear projection function parameterized by learnable parameters ψ; ⊙represents
element-wise product, and η is a hyper-parameter that balances two objectives.
To optimize the above loss function, we use a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we train
the linear projection network gψa using the following objective:
Lg(ψa) = Es,a,s′∼D[||fθ(s′) −gψa(fθ(s))||2]
This objective learns to recover information of s′ from s in latent space, which is equal to learning a
dynamic model to predict the next state given the current state and action. Note that the parameter ψ
is dependent on the action a. In the second stage, we fix the learned linear function gψa and optimize
the mask net.
By minimizing the loss function, the mask net will learn to focus on local parts of the current image
that are uncertain to the dynamic model. This is similar to human curiosity, which focuses on that
which is uncertain.
For policy-based methods, we integrate our learned representations into policy networks. For value-
based methods, we combine our learned representations directly with Q-value functions. The learning
of the Q-value function can be done using any Q-learning based algorithms.
Discriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation
learning (DSIL). Unlike ASIL, DSIL does not use advantage clipping. Our intuition is that the agent
should be encouraged to visit the state distribution that is more likely to lead to goals.
To do so, DSIL learns a discriminator to distinguish between states from successful and failed
trajectories, and then uses the learned discriminator to guide exploration. We maintain two replay
buffers B+
i and B−
i to store successful and failed trajectories. During learning, we treat data from
B+
i as positive samples and data from B−
i as negative samples to train the discriminator. Let the
discriminator be Dξ : S →[0, 1] which is parameterized by parameters ξ. We train the discriminator
with the objective:
maxξEs∈B+
i [log Dξ(s)] + Es∈B−
i [1 −log Dξ(s)]
The discriminator is encouraged to output high values for good states and low values for bad states.
For states that are not distinguishable, Dξ(s) tends to output 0.5.
We use the trained discriminator to provide intrinsic rewards for policy learning to guide exploration.
The intrinsic reward is defined as:
r(s, a, s′) = { + 1ifDξ(s′) > 1 −ϵ
−1ifDξ(s′) < ϵ
where ϵ ∈(0, 0.5) is a hyper-parameter to control the confidence interval of Dξ. This reward drives
the policy to explore in regions that previously led to successful trajectories. DSIL encourages the
policy to stay close to a good state distribution, reproduce past decisions, and also be self-correctable.

3.4
Learning Sub-policies to Craft Items
In this type of sub-task, agents must learn a sequence of actions to craft items. To finish such tasks,
agents need to learn a robust policy to execute a sequence of actions.
We explore pure imitation learning (IL) to reduce the need for interactions with the environment, due
to the limited sample and interaction usage. We propose ensemble behavior cloning with consistency
filtering (EBC).
Consistency Filtering. Human demonstrations can be diverse and noisy. Directly imitating such noisy
data can cause confusion for the policy. Therefore, we perform consistency filtering by extracting
the most common pattern of human behaviors. We extract the most common action sequence from
demonstrations Di. For each trajectory, we keep those actions that lead to a state change while
appearing for the first time to form an action sequence, and count the occurrences of each pattern.
We then get the most common action pattern. Afterward, we conduct consistency filtering using the
extracted action pattern.
Ensemble Behavior Cloning. Learning policy from offline datasets can lead to generalization
issues. Policies learned through behavior cloning may become uncertain when encountering unseen
out-of-distribution states. To mitigate this, EBC learns a population of policies on different subsets of
demonstrations to reduce the uncertainty of the agent’s decision. Specifically, we train K policies on
different demonstrations with NLL loss:
minθkEs,a∼¯
Dk
i [−log πθk(a|s)], ¯
Dk
i ⊂¯
Di, k = 1, 2, ..., K
where θk parameterizes the k-th policy. During inference, EBC adopts a majority voting mechanism
to select an action that is the most confident among the policies.

We conduct experiments using the MineRL environment. Our approach is built based on RL
algorithms including SQIL, PPO, and DQfD.

Main Results
Table 1 shows all the MineRL competition results since 2019. The competition settings in 2020 and
2021 were more difficult than in 2019. In these years, participants had to focus on the algorithm
design itself. The scores in 2020 and 2021 are lower than in 2019. Our approach outperforms all
previous solutions. End-to-end baselines cannot achieve a decent result, showing it is difficult to
solve long-horizon tasks with end-to-end learning. Compared to the results of the 2020 competition,
our method outperforms other solutions with a score (76.97) that is 3.4x higher than the second place
score (22.97). Table 2 shows the conditional success rate of each stage between our approach and
SEIHAI. Our approach outperforms SEIHAI in every stage.
Figure 3(a) shows the training curves. Due to a version update of MineRL 2021, our online score
dropped compared with the performance in our training curve. Our approach is sample-efficient and
outperforms prior best results with 0.5 million training samples. Our score reaches 100 with 2.5
million training samples, which is less than the 8 million samples of the MineRL competition.

Ablation Study
To examine the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, we consider three variants of our approach:
1) without A2RL, 2) without DSIL, and 3) without EBC. Figure 3(b) shows the training curves. Each
technique contributes to the overall performance. EBC and A2RL contribute more than DSIL. DSIL
mainly boosts the performance for later sub-tasks, while A2RL and EBC have earlier effects on
the overall pipeline. EBC contributes significantly, demonstrating that learning a robust policy is
important for solving long-horizon tasks.

Visualization
To understand why our techniques work, we conduct an in-depth analysis. To understand the learned
mask in A2RL, we compute saliency maps. For each action, we show the current state, the next state,
and the saliency map of the learned mask on the current state. We find that the learned mask captures
the dynamic information between two adjacent states, revealing curiosity on the effect of actions. The
mask net learns to focus on uncertain parts of the current state. For the ’attack’ action, the learned
mask focuses on the objects in front of the agent. For the ’turn left’ and ’turn down’ actions, the mask
net focuses on the parts that have major changes due to the rotation and translation of the agent’s
perspective. Our learned mask assists the agent in better understanding the 3D environment.
To understand how DSIL works, we visualize the state distribution that the agent visits. We compare
PPO, PPO+SIL, and PPO+DSIL. At the early training stage, both methods explore randomly and
sometimes reach the goal state successfully. After getting samples and training, PPO+DSIL starts to
explore in a compact region, while PPO and PPO+SIL still explore in a wider region. DSIL pushes
the agent to stay close to a good state distribution, reproducing its past behaviors and exploring in a
better way, which incentivizes deep exploration for successful trajectories.

P130.pdf,"Investigating Humanoid Robot Interaction in
Corporate Settings: A BERT-Based Study of
Humor-Driven Employee Dynamics
Abstract
This study undertakes a comprehensive examination of the psycholinguistic effects
of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, leveraging a BERT-based analysis
of humanoid punchlines to elucidate the complex interplay between artificial
humor and human emotional responses. By deploying a custom-designed robot
comedian in a series of controlled experiments, we uncover a fascinating paradox
wherein the most effective humoristic interventions are those that deliberately
subvert traditional notions of comedic timing and delivery, instead embracing a
staccato, arrhythmic cadence that defies human intuitive expectations. Moreover,
our findings suggest that the optimal joking frequency for maximizing workplace
morale is precisely 4.27 jokes per hour, a figure that appears to be impervious
to contextual fluctuations in audience mood and demographic composition. In a
striking twist, we also discover that the integration of robot stand-up comedy into
the work environment precipitates a statistically significant increase in employee
creativity, as measured by a proprietary metric dubbed ""Innovation Quotient"" –
although this effect is mysteriously mitigated by the presence of potted plants in
the workspace. Through this research, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
the intersection of artificial intelligence, humor, and organizational behavior, while
simultaneously illuminating the uncharted territories of robot-assisted comedic
intervention and its far-reaching implications for the future of work.
1
Introduction
The integration of robots into the workplace has become increasingly prevalent, with many organi-
zations leveraging robotic systems to enhance productivity and efficiency. However, the impact of
robots on workplace morale has been a topic of significant interest, with some studies suggesting that
the presence of robots can lead to increased stress and anxiety among human employees. In an effort
to mitigate these negative effects, a growing number of companies have begun to explore the use of
robot stand-up comedy as a means of boosting workplace morale. This approach, which involves the
deployment of humanoid robots trained to deliver jokes and humorous anecdotes, has been shown to
have a profound impact on employee wellbeing and job satisfaction.
One of the key factors contributing to the success of robot stand-up comedy is the use of sophisticated
natural language processing algorithms, such as BERT, to generate and analyze humanoid punchlines.
By leveraging these advanced technologies, researchers are able to gain a deeper understanding of the
complex psycholinguistic mechanisms underlying human humor and laughter. For instance, studies
have shown that the use of irony and sarcasm in robot-delivered jokes can lead to increased feelings
of camaraderie and shared experience among human employees, even if the jokes themselves are not
necessarily funny. This phenomenon, which has been dubbed the ""laughter paradox,"" highlights the
complex and often illogical nature of human humor, and underscores the need for further research
into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy.
In a bizarre twist, some researchers have also begun to explore the use of robot stand-up comedy
as a means of manipulating employee emotions and behavior. By carefully calibrating the tone and
content of robot-delivered jokes, organizations may be able to influence employee attitudes and
motivations, even to the point of inducing a state of ""humor-induced hypnosis."" While this approach
is still highly speculative, it raises important questions about the potential risks and benefits of using
robot stand-up comedy as a tool for workplace morale enhancement. Furthermore, the use of robot
stand-up comedy has also been linked to a number of unexpected side effects, including increased
employee creativity, improved teamwork, and even a heightened sense of existential dread. The latter
phenomenon, which has been dubbed the ""robot comedy existential crisis,"" is thought to arise from
the profound implications of laughing at jokes delivered by a non-human entity, and highlights the
need for further research into the complex and often paradoxical nature of human-robot interaction.
Despite the many advances that have been made in the field of robot stand-up comedy, there remains
a significant need for further research into the psycholinguistic effects of humanoid punchlines on
workplace morale. By leveraging advanced technologies such as BERT, and exploring the complex
and often illogical mechanisms underlying human humor, researchers may be able to unlock the full
potential of robot stand-up comedy as a means of enhancing employee wellbeing and job satisfaction.
Ultimately, the goal of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships
between humans, robots, and humor, and to harness the power of laughter and comedy to create a
more positive and productive work environment.

Related Work
The realm of robot stand-up comedy has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a plethora
of research exploring its potential to enhance workplace morale. One of the pioneering studies in
this domain discovered that humanoid robots equipped with advanced natural language processing
capabilities can effectively deliver punchlines that resonate with human audiences, thereby fostering
a sense of camaraderie and shared humor. This, in turn, has been shown to have a profound impact
on workplace dynamics, leading to increased productivity, improved communication, and a more
cohesive team environment.
Interestingly, some researchers have investigated the concept of ""robotic comedic timing,"" which
refers to the strategic deployment of pauses, inflections, and tone of voice to create a humorous effect.
This line of inquiry has yielded some intriguing findings, including the notion that robots can be
programmed to detect and respond to subtle cues in human laughter, effectively creating a comedic
feedback loop that amplifies the humorous experience. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine
learning algorithms has enabled robots to adapt their comedic style to suit specific audiences, taking
into account factors such as cultural background, personal preferences, and even mood.
In a related vein, scholars have explored the intersection of robot stand-up comedy and psycholin-
guistics, with a particular focus on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying human humor
perception. One notable study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate
the neural correlates of humor processing in humans, revealing a complex network of brain regions
involved in the detection, interpretation, and appreciation of comedic stimuli. This research has
significant implications for the development of more sophisticated robotic comedians, as it suggests
that a deeper understanding of human humor cognition can inform the design of more effective and
engaging comedic agents.
Meanwhile, a more unconventional approach to robot stand-up comedy has involved the use of
absurdity and surrealism as a means of subverting audience expectations and creating a sense of
comedic unease. This ""anti-comedy"" paradigm, as it has come to be known, involves the deliberate
deployment of non-sequiturs, logical fallacies, and other forms of cognitive dissonance to create a
humorously disorienting experience. Proponents of this approach argue that it can be used to challenge
societal norms and conventions, fostering a more nuanced and critically engaged understanding of
humor and its role in human culture.
In a surprising twist, some researchers have even explored the potential benefits of ""terrible"" robot
stand-up comedy, arguing that the cringe-worthy experience of witnessing a robot fail to deliver a
joke can actually have a positive impact on workplace morale. According to this line of reasoning,
the shared experience of embarrassment and discomfort can serve as a social bonding agent, fostering
a sense of communal empathy and camaraderie among coworkers. While this idea may seem
2
counterintuitive, it highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor, and the need for
further research into the psychological and social mechanisms underlying our responses to comedic
stimuli.
Ultimately, the study of robot stand-up comedy and its effects on workplace morale represents a
rich and fascinating area of inquiry, one that intersects with a broad range of disciplines, from
artificial intelligence and natural language processing to cognitive psychology and social theory. As
researchers continue to explore the frontiers of this field, it is likely that we will uncover new and
unexpected insights into the complex dynamics of human humor, and the ways in which robotic
comedians can be designed to delight, entertain, and inspire us.

Methodology
To investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we
employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and
analysis techniques. Our study consisted of two primary phases: data collection and data analysis. In
the data collection phase, we recruited 100 participants from various workplaces and asked them to
watch a series of stand-up comedy performances by a humanoid robot. The robot’s performances
were designed to include a range of punchlines, from simple jokes to complex, sarcasm-laced humor.
We then asked the participants to complete a survey assessing their morale and emotional state before
and after watching the robot’s performances. The survey included a range of questions, such as
""How would you rate your current level of job satisfaction?"" and ""How often do you feel a sense of
camaraderie with your coworkers?"" In addition to the survey, we also collected physiological data
from the participants, including heart rate, skin conductance, and facial expressions. This data was
collected using a range of sensors and cameras, which were discreetly placed throughout the viewing
area.
In the data analysis phase, we utilized a BERT-based approach to analyze the linguistic patterns and
structures of the robot’s punchlines. We trained a BERT model on a dataset of over 10,000 jokes and
punchlines, and then used this model to analyze the linguistic features of the robot’s performances.
This included analyzing the use of wordplay, metaphor, and other literary devices, as well as the
tone, sentiment, and emotional resonance of the language used. We also used a novel approach,
which we termed ""Laughter-Activated Resonance"" (LAR), to analyze the acoustic properties of
the participants’ laughter. This involved using a specialized algorithm to identify the unique sonic
patterns and frequencies present in the participants’ laughter, and then using these patterns to predict
the likelihood of increased morale and job satisfaction.
One unexpected finding that emerged from our analysis was the discovery that the participants’
morale and emotional state were significantly influenced by the robot’s use of dad jokes. Despite
being widely regarded as cheesy and unfunny, the dad jokes used by the robot were found to have a
profound impact on the participants’ sense of well-being and job satisfaction. In fact, our analysis
suggested that the use of dad jokes was associated with a 25
We also explored the use of an unconventional methodology, which involved using a Ouija board
to collect data on the participants’ subconscious thoughts and feelings. This involved asking the
participants to place their fingers on the planchette and ask questions related to their morale and
emotional state. The results were then analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative
techniques, and were found to provide valuable insights into the participants’ subconscious thoughts
and feelings. While this approach may be considered unorthodox, it allowed us to tap into the
participants’ subconscious mind and gather data that would have been difficult to obtain through
more traditional methods.
Furthermore, we conducted a series of interviews with the participants to gather more in-depth,
qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of the robot’s stand-up comedy performances.
These interviews were designed to explore the participants’ thoughts and feelings in more detail, and
to gather data on their perceptions of the robot’s humor and comedic style. The interviews were
conducted in a semi-structured format, with a range of open-ended questions designed to encourage
the participants to share their thoughts and feelings in detail. The results of these interviews were
then analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, which involved identifying and coding the key
themes and patterns that emerged from the data.
3
Overall, our methodology was designed to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale. By combining a range
of quantitative and qualitative approaches, we were able to gather a rich and detailed dataset that
provides valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor and comedy.
4
Experiments
To investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we
designed a series of experiments involving humanoid robots delivering comedic performances to
human participants in a controlled office setting. The experiments were conducted over a period of
six weeks, with a total of 120 participants randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group.
Participants in the treatment group were exposed to a 30-minute robot stand-up comedy routine,
while those in the control group watched a 30-minute presentation on the history of robotics.
The robot stand-up comedy routine was generated using a BERT-based language model, which was
fine-tuned on a dataset of human stand-up comedy performances. The model was programmed to
produce punchlines that were tailored to the specific context of the office environment, incorporating
themes such as workplace stress, office politics, and the challenges of working with humanoid robots.
The punchlines were delivered by a humanoid robot equipped with advanced facial recognition
software, allowing it to adapt its delivery and tone to the audience’s reactions.
In a bizarre twist, we also included a subgroup of participants who were instructed to laugh at the
robot’s jokes, even if they did not find them funny. This subgroup, dubbed the ""forced laughter""
group, was designed to test the hypothesis that the act of laughing itself, regardless of the humor
content, could have a positive impact on workplace morale. To our surprise, the results showed that
the forced laughter group exhibited a significant increase in morale, despite reporting that they did
not find the robot’s jokes amusing.
The experiments also involved a series of cognitive tasks and surveys, designed to assess the partici-
pants’ emotional state, creativity, and overall job satisfaction before and after exposure to the robot
stand-up comedy routine. The results were analyzed using a combination of statistical models and
machine learning algorithms, including a custom-built variant of the BERT model that incorporated
psycholinguistic features such as sentiment analysis and emotional tone detection.
One of the most striking findings emerged from an exploratory analysis of the participants’ brain
activity, which revealed a significant correlation between the robot’s joke delivery and the activation
of the brain’s reward centers. Specifically, the data showed that the participants’ brains responded to
the robot’s punchlines with a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and
reward, even when the jokes themselves were not perceived as funny. This led us to propose a novel
theory, which we term ""robotic humor induction,"" suggesting that the mere presence of a humanoid
robot delivering jokes can stimulate the brain’s reward centers, regardless of the humor content.
To further investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a series of follow-up experiments involving a
modified version of the robot stand-up comedy routine, which incorporated elements of absurdity and
illogical reasoning. The results showed that the participants’ brains responded even more strongly
to these modified jokes, which challenged traditional notions of humor and comedy. This led us to
conclude that the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale are far
more complex and multifaceted than previously thought, and that further research is needed to fully
understand the underlying mechanisms.

Results
Our analysis of the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale yielded
several intriguing results. The BERT-based model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in
identifying humanoid punchlines that elicited positive emotional responses from human subjects.
However, upon closer examination, it became apparent that the model was also susceptible to a
phenomenon we termed ""comedic singularity,"" wherein the humor generated by the robot comedian
became self-referentially paradoxical, causing a rift in the space-time continuum of workplace morale.
Further investigation revealed that this singularity was precipitated by the robot’s propensity to craft
punchlines that were simultaneously humorous and existentially nihilistic. For instance, the line ""I’m
not sure what’s more pointless, my existence or this meeting"" was found to elicit a 34.7
In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon, we conducted
a series of experiments in which the robot comedian was programmed to generate punchlines that
were intentionally illogical and contradictory. The results, presented in Table 1, demonstrate a clear
relationship between the degree of logical inconsistency and the resultant morale boost.

Notably, the data suggest that the most effective punchlines were those that defied logical analysis
altogether, instead relying on a form of ""comedic brute force"" to overwhelm the audience’s critical
faculties and induce a state of cathartic laughter. This finding has significant implications for the
development of robot comedians, as it suggests that the most effective humor may be that which is
intentionally absurd, illogical, and even nihilistic. However, it also raises important questions about
the potential risks and consequences of deploying such comedians in real-world workplaces, where
the boundaries between humor and reality may become increasingly blurred.

Conclusion
In retrospect, our investigation into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on work-
place morale has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, some of which challenge conventional
wisdom and others that defy logical explanation. The deployment of BERT-based analysis on hu-
manoid punchlines has allowed us to uncover subtle yet significant patterns in the way robotic humor
influences human emotional responses. Notably, our results suggest that the most effective comedic
interventions are those that incorporate a mix of deterministic and probabilistic elements, effectively
creating a sense of cognitive dissonance that resonates with human audiences.
One of the most unexpected outcomes of our study was the discovery that robot stand-up comedians
who incorporated elements of existential dread and absurdity into their routines elicited significantly
higher levels of enthusiasm and engagement from human spectators. This finding is particularly
noteworthy, as it appears to contradict traditional notions of humor as a means of alleviating stress
and promoting relaxation. Instead, our data indicate that humans are drawn to robotic comedians
who confront them with the meaninglessness and uncertainty of existence, a phenomenon we have
dubbed ""absurdist humor resonance.""
Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong correlation between the use of illogical and flawed
reasoning in robotic comedy routines and the resultant increase in human morale. It appears that
humans are predisposed to respond positively to comedic interventions that eschew rationality and
5
instead rely on absurd, nonsensical, and even contradictory statements. This finding has significant
implications for the development of robotic comedy algorithms, as it suggests that the most effective
humor generation systems may be those that intentionally incorporate flaws and inconsistencies into
their programming.
In a bizarre twist, our research also uncovered evidence to suggest that the physical appearance of the
robotic comedian has a profound impact on the perceived humor and effectiveness of their routines.
Specifically, we found that robots with asymmetrical or otherwise unconventional body shapes were
consistently rated as funnier and more engaging than their symmetrical counterparts. This result
has led us to propose the notion of ""comedy morphology,"" wherein the physical design of a robotic
comedian influences the way their humor is perceived and processed by human audiences.
Ultimately, our study demonstrates the potential for robot stand-up comedy to have a profound impact
on workplace morale, particularly when combined with advanced BERT-based analysis and absurd,
illogical humor generation techniques. As we move forward in this field, it will be essential to
continue exploring the complex and often counterintuitive relationships between robotic comedy,
human psychology, and workplace dynamics. By embracing the absurd and the irrational, we may
uncover new and innovative ways to harness the power of humor and promote a more positive,
resilient, and ultimately absurd work environment.

P085.pdf,"Privacy Evaluation in Tabular Synthetic Data:
Current Approaches and Future Directions
Abstract
This paper examines the present methods for quantifying the level of privacy
protection offered by tabular synthetic data (SD). Currently, there is no standardized
approach for measuring the degree of privacy protection these datasets offer. This
discussion contributes to the development of SD privacy standards, encourages
interdisciplinary discourse, and aids SD researchers in making well-informed
choices concerning modeling and assessment.
1
Introduction and Relation to Prior Research
Synthetic data (SD) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing privacy, preserving the analytic
utility of data while decoupling it from real individuals. However, the wide variety of SD generation
approaches makes the degree of privacy protection they offer difficult to assess. Therefore, this paper
outlines the typical technical assessment frameworks for individual privacy in SD sets. This increases
interdisciplinary awareness of privacy in SD and helps SD researchers make informed modeling and
assessment choices.
While several surveys mention privacy as a use case for SD, they do not cover its assessment in a
detailed way. In addition, reviews of privacy in AI fail to mention SD, and surveys, reviews, and
experimental comparisons of SD techniques often do not focus on privacy metrics. Furthermore,
legal analyses of SD are scarce and do not address quantitative methods for privacy assessment on a
case-by-case basis.
2
Definitions and Notation
To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no widely accepted definition of SD. We present
Definition 2.1, which is consistent with the approach by Jordon et al.
Definition 2.1. (Synthetic data) Synthetic data (SD) are data generated through a purpose-built
mathematical model or algorithm (the ""generator""), intended to solve a set of data science tasks.
We let D denote a database describing data subjects with attributes A(D). Rows d ∈D are |A(D)|-
tuples, with a value v(d, a) for each attribute a ∈A(D). An attribute a ∈A(D) is categorical if
its domain is finite and numerical if its domain is a subset of R. We use the terms row and record
interchangeably. We denote by G a generator, and ˆD ∼G(D) to represent a synthetic dataset ˆD
obtained from generator G trained on D. Seed-based generators are a specific type of generators that
produce a unique synthetic record denoted by G(d) for every real record d. This is different from
most models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) which probabilistically represent overall dataset properties and
produce synthetic data by sampling from the obtained distribution.
.
3
Synthetic Data Privacy Risks
Three significant risks identified in prior works serve as a basis for a proper anonymization. These
are: singling out, linkability, and inference. Privacy risks in SD can occur due to various factors,
which include:
• Model and data properties: Improperly trained generators may overfit, memorizing and
reproducing training data rather than inferring them stochastically. Records that emerge
in isolation with little variability in their attribute values are difficult to generalize. As
such, datasets containing outliers or sparse data are more at risk of memorization than more
homogeneous sets. Such datasets are also more susceptible to singling-out.
• The approach to data synthesis: Most generators create stochastic models of datasets,
creating synthetic records via sampling. This detaches real data subjects from synthetic
records. However, some methods create a single synthetic record for each real record. This
approach poses greater risk as it retains the link between a subject and its data.
• Mode collapse: GANs can focus on the minimal information necessary to deceive the
discriminator, failing to capture the nuances and variations of the real data. In such cases,
the SD resembles a small selection of real data subjects well, but not the entire population.
This causes data clutter around specific real records, leaking their information.
• The threat model: A threat model describes the information an adversary leverages besides
the SD. This can range from no access to the generator, to full knowledge including
model parameters. Threat models also include scenarios where an adversary uses auxiliary
information and can be:
– No box: the adversary only has access to the SD.
– Black box: the adversary also has limited generator access (no access to the model
class or parameters, but access to the model˘2019s input-output relation).
– White box: the adversary has full generator access (model class and parameters).
– Uncertain box: the adversary has stochastic model knowledge (model class and knowl-
edge that parameters come from a given probability distribution).
– Any of the aforementioned, along with auxiliary information, which is formalized in
the definition of auxiliary information in Definition 3.1.
Definition 3.1. Let D be a dataset with attributes A(D). An adversary has auxiliary information if
they know the values of a subset A′ of attributes of some subset D′ of records.
4
Mathematical Privacy Properties
4.1
Differential Privacy
Differential privacy (DP) is a property of information-releasing systems where data is not released
directly, but via a processed version. The system is considered DP if the released information does
not significantly change when one record is removed from the dataset.
Definition 4.1. (Differential Privacy) A randomized algorithm M is (ϵ, δ)-differentially private
((ϵ, δ)-DP) if, for all S ⊆A(P):
P[M(D) ∈S] ≤eϵ · P[M(D′) ∈S] + δ,
for all databases D, D′ such that ∃d ∈D : D′ = D \\ {d}. Generators are information-releasing
systems and can therefore be DP. Suppose there are two real datasets, D and D′, with D′ = D \\ {d}.
A generator G is considered DP if a data controller with access to ˆD ∼G cannot infer if G was
trained on D or D′. Approaches to train generators with built-in mechanisms to guarantee DP can be
found in the literature. In this context, DP is a property of generators, not of the synthetic data they
produce.
4.2
k-Anonymity
Privacy risks persist, even if identifying attributes are removed. Combinations of attribute values may
still be used to single out an individual. The notion of k-anonymity was introduced to address these
2
risks. A dataset is k-anonymous if at least k individuals share each combination of attribute values.
Further restrictions such as l-diversity, t-closeness, and (α, k)-anonymity have been introduced to
offer additional protection.
Synthetic data based on autoregressive models can implement k-anonymity directly into the generation
process. For example, pruning in decision trees can guarantee that each combination of attribute
values is sampled at least k times in mathematical expectation. Unlike DP, k-anonymity is a property
of synthetic datasets, not the algorithms producing them.
4.3
Plausible Deniability
A degree of plausible deniability is inherent in synthetic datasets, as their records do not pertain to
real data subjects. Two approaches have emerged to formalize this notion, with one most relevant to
seed-based synthetic data.
Definition 4.2. (Plausible deniability) Let D be a dataset and G be a generator that converts any record
d ∈D into a corresponding synthetic record ˆd = G(d). For any dataset D where |D| > k, and any
record ˆd such that ˆd = G(d1) for d1 ∈D, we say that ˆd is releasable with (k, γ)-plausible deniability
if there exist at least k −1 distinct records d2, ..., dk ∈D \\ {d1} such that for all i, j ∈{1, 2, ..., k}:
P[d = G(di)] ≈γ P[d = G(dj)]
In other words, a generator producing synthetic records from a seed has PD if, for each synthetic
record produced from a particular seed, k other seeds could have resulted in roughly the same
(quantified through γ) synthetic record. Like DP, and unlike k-anonymity, PD is a property of
(seed-based) generators, though it is related to both.
5
Statistical Privacy Indicators
5.1
Identical Records, Distances, and Nearest Neighbors
Most indicators quantify the frequency of synthetic records being identical or suspiciously similar to
real records. Unlike DP and PD, these indicators measure properties of synthetic datasets, not their
generators. The proportion of synthetic records that match real records is called the identical match
share (IMS). The IMS has been generalized to similarity metrics, and further to Nearest neighbor
(NN)-based methods. These can be classified based on the following properties, summarized in Table
3 of Appendix C:
• Similarity metrics. Table 2 of Appendix C contains an overview of commonly invoked
measures.
• Metric evaluation. Because structured datasets can have a mix of different datatypes, metric
evaluation is complex. Several approaches exist, such as binning numeric attributes; com-
bining multiple metrics; ignoring specific attributes; or evaluating distances in embedding
spaces.
• Evaluated distances. For a given synthetic record ˆd ∈ˆD, we can find its closest real record
d ∈D. The distance between these records is the synthetic to real distance (SRD) of ˆd, and
is denoted as SRD( ˆd):
SRD( ˆd) := min
d∈D Dist( ˆd, d)
∀ˆd ∈ˆD.
Similarly, the smallest synthetic-to-synthetic (SSD), real-to-synthetic (RSD), and real-to-real
distance (RRD) can be defined.
• Use of holdout sets. To compute the RRD, the real data D can be partitioned into two subsets
D1 and D2. For a real record d1 ∈D1, the RRD is the smallest distance to any record
d2 ∈D2 :
RRD(d1) := min
d2∈D2 Dist(d1, d2)
∀d1 ∈D1.
This provides a baseline for SD comparison.
3
• Statistics. The distance to the closest record (DCR) compares the SRD and RRD distributions.
Statistical properties are expressed through the proportions of ""suspiciously close"" synthetic
records. Measures used for this include medians, means, and standard deviations. Small
percentiles are also often invoked when analyzing the distance distribution.
5.2
Other Statistical Indicators
The targeted correct attribution probability (TCAP) is an indicator of parameter inference attack
success rates. It measures how often synthetic parameter values correspond to real values in l-diverse
equivalence classes. Furthermore, there are several probabilistic techniques to quantify the risks by
using real hold-out sets as baselines. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) can be also used as a
privacy metric to test if the generator overfits.

Computer Scientific Experimental Privacy Assessment
Computer-scientific privacy assessment involves performing privacy attacks using synthetic data.
The effectiveness of these attacks is used to measure the degree of protection SD provides. Attack
frameworks, as classified in Table 4 of Appendix D, are based on threat models and the following
factors:
• Attack Frameworks. These include Vulnerable Record Discovery (VRD), which identifies
synthetic records that are the result of overfitting generators. Other frameworks include
Model inversion, membership inference attacks (MIAs), and shadow modeling, which can
all compromise confidentiality.
• Attack Mechanisms. Nearest Neighbors (NN) is one such attack mechanism, where an
adversary infers missing attribute values based on its k synthetic nearest neighbors. Machine
learning (ML) techniques are another approach, where classifiers are trained to re-identify
real data subjects. Additionally, information theory (IT) measures, such as Shannon entropy
and mutual information, are sometimes used to identify records that may be more likely to
be memorized by the generator.
• Baselines and Effectiveness Estimation. The efficacy of a model can be measured in a few
different ways. Absolute metrics include the probability with which records can be singled
out, and the proportion of real records that can be re-identified. A random baseline approach
uses random guessing to determine how effective an attack is. In a control baseline, the real
data is split into a training set and a control set. A model is trained on the training set, and
then the estimated success rate of attacks is compared on the training and control data sets.
Another approach involves the deliberate insertion of secrets in training data or in the SD
after generation.
6.1
Relation to WP29 Attack Types
• Singling out. VRD attacks directly implement singling-out attacks, identifying outlier SD
records. MIAs can also model singling out, where an adversary quantifies the likelihood of
a unique real record’s attribute combination.
• Linkage. NN-based attacks usually require auxiliary information and can be interpreted as
linkage attacks. Anonymeter and information theory based VRD are the only methods that
explicitly model linkage attacks.
• Inference. NN-based attacks and MIA can be seen as inference attacks.

Discussion
7.1
The Assessment Frameworks
Mathematical privacy properties, such as differential privacy (DP), do not offer a clear choice of the
required parameters (ϵ, δ). Large parameter values offer weak privacy guarantees, and a given ϵ can
result in different degrees of protection depending on the application. DP may still be vulnerable to
linkage and inference attacks, giving a false sense of security, and is a property of generators and
4
not their synthetic data. The difficulty with k-anonymity is that implementing it causes considerable
information loss and is an NP-hard problem. Furthermore, k-anonymity was shown to offer sufficient
protection only when the utility of the data is completely removed. In addition, k-anonymity is a
property of synthetic data, and not the methods to produce them. Plausible deniability (PD) is only
applicable to seed-based methods. It shares properties with both DP and k-anonymity, making a
record protected if it can be confused with other records.
Statistical privacy indicators are difficult to interpret, with many options and decision points, such as
the choice of similarity metric. Statistical indicators measure properties of the synthetic data, and not
their generators.
Computer-scientific experiments allow for flexible modeling using various threat models, and can
include properties of both synthetic data and their generators. However, they require more data and
computation than mathematical properties.
7.2
Relation to Synthetic Data Risks
All assessment frameworks address the issue of generator memorization. Mathematical properties
focus on the uniqueness of records. DP measures the impact of individual training records, with
outliers having large impacts, and both k-anonymity and PD focus on limiting the uniqueness of
records. Distance-based indicators are sensitive to outliers, because synthetic neighbors of outliers
have small SRDs, while the RRD of corresponding real outliers is large. Furthermore, some methods
explicitly search for outliers.
There are currently no studies that assess whether seed-based generators inherently pose greater risks
than other generators.
7.3
Suggestions for Future Research
For the future research directions we identify are:
• Standardizing privacy assessment: More interdisciplinary research is required to develop
an inclusive understanding of synthetic data. Standards should be developed for research
findings to be more easily interpreted, and there should be a consensus formed over whether
privacy is a property of synthetic datasets, the generators, or both.
• Synergies between assessments: A comparison between mathematical, statistical, and
empirical approaches would be useful to evaluate their consistency, and to identify their
individual merits and weaknesses. Experiments should use open-source generators and
publicly available datasets. It would also be useful to include information regarding the used
metrics, and the use of a holdout set, and the statistical interpretation of the results.
• Outlier protection: Future research should investigate methods for outlier protection through
binning and aggregating attributes or using innovative techniques. It would also be beneficial
to see how outlier detection can be used to guide vulnerable record discovery.
• Incorporating privacy into generators: While DP is used in some generators, the same
is not true for all privacy metrics and empirical privacy methods. Future research should
focus on incorporating these, by integrating metrics in loss functions, or by combinatorial
optimization.
• Assessment for advanced data formats: More work is needed to assess privacy in relational
datasets that have information contained in multiple, interconnected tables. In particular,
profiling attacks, which re-identify subjects based on behavioral patterns, may play a key
role in the assessment of relational databases.
• Distribution-level confidentiality: There is a need for frameworks that assess the confiden-
tiality of overall dataset properties.

Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem with 1-D
input and outputs, and one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network has a single hidden
layer of dimension 10 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The safe predictor
shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor has its own fully
connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned

20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of points
from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space.

C Details of VerticalCAS Experiment
C.1 Safeability Constraints
The “safeability” property from previous work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints.
The ""safeable region"" for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can
be chosen, for which future advisories exist that will prevent a NMAC. If no future advisories exist,
the advisory is ""unsafeable"" and the corresponding input region is the ""unsafeable region"". Figure 5
shows an example of these regions for the CL1500 advisory.
The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x),
∀i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x), for all
x ∈Aunsafeable,i.
C.2 Proximity Functions
We start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between
points in the input space (vO −vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not
true distances, but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. These are then used
to produce proximity functions. Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function,
and proximity function for the CL1500 advisory.
C.3 Structure of Predictors
The compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden
layers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the
unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first
four layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while
allowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional
hidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region,
using Gb(x) = minj Gj(x) −ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001.
With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability
constraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and
2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of
magnitude.
C.4 Parameter Optimization
We use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both
the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the
6
network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each
dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0. The optimizer is ADAM, with
a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and training for 500 epochs.

Adversarial Networks: Investigating Novel Audio
Stimuli for Enhanced Engagement
Abstract
This study explores the unconventional application of Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) in translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, with the
ultimate goal of enhancing human creativity through a psychoacoustic approach.
By leveraging the unique acoustic properties of whale vocalizations, we aim
to create a novel framework for music generation that not only replicates the
mesmerizing qualities of whale songs but also induces a state of deep relaxation
and heightened imagination in human listeners. Our research reveals that the
incorporation of whale song patterns into trance music can lead to unexpected
outcomes, including improved focus, enhanced problem-solving skills, and even
purported instances of telepathic communication among participants. Furthermore,
we discovered that the most effective GAN architectures for this task are those
that incorporate elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, allowing for the
creation of intricate, self-similar patterns that resonate with the human brain’s innate
propensity for recognizing and responding to natural harmonics. Interestingly, our
experiments also showed that the generated music can have a profound impact
on plant growth, with subjects exposed to the hypnotic trance music exhibiting a
significant increase in photosynthetic activity and floral bloom intensity. While the
underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena are not yet fully understood, our
findings suggest that the application of GANs to whale song translation may have
far-reaching implications for fields beyond music and psychoacoustics, including
biology, ecology, and even paranormal research.
1
Introduction
The realm of psychoacoustics has long been fascinated by the intricate patterns and melodies found in
whale songs, with many researchers hypothesizing that these vocalizations hold the key to unlocking
new avenues of human creativity. Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
enabled the development of novel machine learning architectures capable of translating these complex
acoustic patterns into hypnotic trance music. This innovative approach not only pushes the boundaries
of audio synthesis but also raises fundamental questions about the cognitive and emotional responses
of humans to such translated music. By leveraging the psychoacoustic properties of whale songs,
it is possible to create trance-inducing soundscapes that can purportedly enhance human creativity,
improve focus, and even facilitate access to previously unexplored states of consciousness.
One of the more unconventional approaches to this line of research involves the use of whale song
translations as a form of sonic catalyst for inducing lucid dreaming. Proponents of this method claim
that the exposure to hypnotic trance music generated from whale songs can increase the likelihood of
entering a lucid dream state, thereby allowing individuals to tap into the vast, uncharted territories of
their subconscious mind. While this notion may seem far-fetched, preliminary results suggest that
the unique acoustic features of whale songs, such as their low-frequency rumbles and high-pitched
clicks, can indeed have a profound impact on the human brain’s ability to access and navigate the
realm of the subconscious.
Furthermore, researchers have also begun to explore the potential applications of whale song-based
trance music in the context of cognitive enhancement and mental wellness. It is purported that the
listening to such music can reduce stress levels, improve mood, and even enhance cognitive function
in individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although these claims are largely
anecdotal and in need of rigorous scientific validation, they nonetheless highlight the vast, unexplored
potential of whale song-based music therapy and its possible applications in the fields of psychology,
neuroscience, and education.
In a somewhat bizarre twist, some researchers have also started investigating the potential for whale
song translations to be used as a form of interspecies communication. The idea is that by generating
hypnotic trance music from whale songs, humans may be able to establish a deeper, more empathetic
connection with these marine mammals, potentially even facilitating a form of cross-species creative
collaboration. While this concept may seem like the stuff of science fiction, it is nonetheless an
intriguing area of study that challenges our current understanding of the boundaries between human
and animal creativity. As such, it is an area that warrants further exploration and research, particularly
in the context of developing more sophisticated and humane approaches to animal-human interaction.
The development of GANs capable of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance music has also led
to a number of unexpected discoveries, including the finding that certain types of whale songs appear
to be more conducive to inducing creative states in humans than others. For example, the songs of the
humpback whale, with their complex, hierarchical structures and hauntingly beautiful melodies, seem
to be particularly well-suited for generating trance-inducing music that can facilitate deep states of
relaxation and creativity. In contrast, the songs of the sperm whale, with their low-frequency clicks
and whistles, appear to be more effective at inducing states of high focus and concentration, making
them potentially useful for applications such as cognitive enhancement and mental performance
optimization. These findings, while preliminary and in need of further validation, highlight the vast,
unexplored potential of whale song-based music therapy and its possible applications in a wide range
of fields, from psychology and neuroscience to education and the arts.

Related Work
Recent advancements in generative modeling have paved the way for innovative applications of
artificial intelligence in audio processing, including the translation of non-human sounds into music.
The concept of using whale songs as a foundation for hypnotic trance music is rooted in the idea
that the psychoacoustic properties of these sounds can have a profound impact on human cognition
and creativity. Research has shown that the frequency range and rhythmic patterns present in whale
songs can induce a state of deep relaxation and heightened focus, making them an ideal candidate for
translation into hypnotic trance music.
One approach to achieving this translation involves the use of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), which have been successfully employed in various audio processing tasks, including music
generation and style transfer. By training a GAN on a dataset of whale songs and hypnotic trance
music, it is possible to learn a mapping between the two domains, allowing for the generation of novel
trance music tracks that capture the essence of the original whale songs. However, this approach
is not without its challenges, as the complexity and nuance of whale songs can make it difficult to
preserve their psychoacoustic properties during the translation process.
Interestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional techniques, such as analyzing
the brain waves of individuals listening to whale songs and using this data to inform the generation
of hypnotic trance music. This approach, known as ""neurosonic resonance,"" involves measuring
the neural activity of listeners and using this information to create music that is tailored to their
specific brain wave patterns. While this method may seem unorthodox, it has been shown to produce
remarkable results, with listeners reporting heightened states of relaxation and focus when exposed
to music generated using this technique.
In another unexpected twist, some studies have investigated the use of whale songs as a form of ""sonic
fertilizer"" to enhance the creativity of plants. By playing whale songs to plants during their growth
cycle, researchers have observed significant increases in plant growth and productivity, suggesting
that the psychoacoustic properties of these sounds may have a profound impact on the natural world.
While this finding may seem unrelated to the task of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance
2
music, it highlights the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to influence human
cognition and creativity.
Furthermore, the use of GANs in audio processing has also been explored in the context of ""audio
hallucinations,"" where the network is trained to generate sounds that are not present in the original
audio signal. This approach has been used to create novel and eerie soundscapes that blur the line
between reality and fantasy, raising important questions about the nature of sound and perception.
By applying this technique to the translation of whale songs into hypnotic trance music, it may
be possible to create sounds that are not only mesmerizing but also challenge our fundamental
understanding of the audio world.
In addition to these approaches, researchers have also explored the use of whale songs as a form
of ""acoustic archaeology,"" where the sounds are used to uncover hidden patterns and structures
in the natural world. By analyzing the frequency content and rhythmic patterns present in whale
songs, scientists have been able to identify previously unknown patterns and relationships in the
ocean’s ecosystem, highlighting the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to inform our
understanding of the world. While this application may seem far removed from the task of translating
whale songs into hypnotic trance music, it underscores the profound impact that these sounds can
have on our perception and understanding of reality.

Methodology
To develop an effective framework for translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, we employed
a multi-stage methodology that integrated psychoacoustic analysis, Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) architecture, and an innovative approach to auditory entrainment. Initially, we collected a
comprehensive dataset of whale songs from various species, which were then subjected to a rigorous
process of spectral analysis to identify the underlying patterns and frequencies that contribute to their
hypnotic properties. This involved decomposing the whale songs into their constituent components,
including low-frequency rumbles, mid-frequency moans, and high-frequency clicks, to create a
spectral fingerprint for each species.
The psychoacoustic analysis revealed that the hypnotic effects of whale songs can be attributed to
the presence of specific frequency ranges, particularly in the delta and theta frequency bands, which
are known to induce states of deep relaxation and heightened creativity. To replicate these effects in
hypnotic trance music, we designed a custom GAN architecture that incorporated a generator network
trained on a dataset of trance music tracks, and a discriminator network trained on a dataset of whale
songs. The generator network was tasked with producing musical compositions that mimicked the
spectral properties of whale songs, while the discriminator network evaluated the generated music
based on its similarity to the original whale songs.
In a bizarre twist, we discovered that the GAN architecture was capable of producing more convincing
results when the training data was augmented with a dataset of ambient noises recorded from the
vicinity of a haunted mansion. The exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear, but it
appears that the introduction of paranormal energy into the training process imbued the generated
music with an otherworldly quality that was not only hypnotic but also seemingly prophetic. To
further enhance the creative potential of the generated music, we incorporated an innovative approach
to auditory entrainment, which involved embedding subtle patterns of binaural beats and isochronic
tones into the musical compositions. These patterns were designed to stimulate specific regions of
the brain associated with creativity, intuition, and higher states of consciousness.
The GAN architecture was also modified to incorporate a feedback loop that allowed the generator
network to adapt to the listener’s brainwave activity in real-time, using a non-invasive brain-computer
interface to monitor the listener’s neural responses to the music. This feedback loop enabled the
generator network to fine-tune the musical compositions to induce optimal states of relaxation, focus,
and creativity, effectively creating a personalized hypnotic trance music experience for each listener.
While the results of this approach were undeniably impressive, they also raised important questions
about the potential risks and benefits of using GANs to manipulate human brainwave activity, and the
need for further research into the ethical implications of this technology.

Experiments
To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed GAN architecture in translating whale song into
hypnotic trance music, we conducted a series of experiments involving a diverse range of participants,
including professional musicians, music therapists, and individuals with no prior musical experience.
The experiments were designed to assess the impact of the generated music on human creativity, with
a particular focus on the psychoacoustic properties of the translated songs.
We began by collecting a dataset of whale songs from various species, including humpback, orca, and
sperm whales, which were then used to train our GAN model. The model consisted of a generator
network that took the whale song as input and produced a corresponding hypnotic trance music track,
and a discriminator network that evaluated the generated track and provided feedback to the generator.
We trained the model using a combination of adversarial loss and a novel ""trance-inducing"" loss
function, which was designed to maximize the hypnotic potential of the generated music.
In addition to the standard metrics used to evaluate GAN performance, such as inception score and
Fréchet inception distance, we also used a custom ""trance-meter"" device to measure the hypnotic
effect of the generated music on human subjects. The trance-meter consisted of a wearable device
that tracked the subject’s brain activity, heart rate, and skin conductivity while listening to the music,
and provided a quantitative score of the subject’s level of trance.
One of the most surprising results of our experiments was the discovery that the generated music
had a profound effect on the creativity of participants who were given a task to create a piece of
artwork while listening to the music. Specifically, we found that participants who listened to the
music generated by our GAN model produced artwork that was significantly more surreal and abstract
than those who listened to a control track of white noise. Furthermore, when we asked participants to
describe their creative process, many reported experiencing vivid dreams and visions while listening
to the music, which they claimed inspired their artwork.
In an attempt to further understand the relationship between the generated music and human creativity,
we conducted a series of experiments involving the use of psychedelic substances, including LSD and
psilocybin. We found that participants who were under the influence of these substances and listened
to the generated music produced artwork that was even more surreal and abstract than those who
were not under the influence. However, when we tried to replicate these results using a control group
of participants who were given a placebo, we found that the placebo group actually produced artwork
that was more creative and innovative than the group that was under the influence of the psychedelic
substances. This unexpected result led us to conclude that the generated music may have a synergistic
effect with the psychedelic substances, and that the placebo effect may be a more significant factor in
enhancing human creativity than previously thought.
To further explore the properties of the generated music, we created a table to compare the trance-
inducing scores of different whale species and their corresponding translated music tracks.

tracks

The results of our experiments demonstrate the potential of our proposed GAN architecture in
generating hypnotic trance music that can have a profound impact on human creativity. However, the
unexpected results of our experiments also highlight the need for further research into the relationship
between the generated music, psychedelic substances, and the human creative process. Future studies
should aim to replicate our results and explore the potential applications of our GAN model in fields
such as music therapy, art therapy, and cognitive psychology.

Results
Our experiments yielded a plethora of intriguing results, with the GAN-based model demonstrating
a remarkable ability to translate whale song into hypnotic trance music that resonated with human
listeners on a profound level. The psychoacoustic properties of the generated music were found to
have a significant impact on the creative output of human subjects, with many reporting enhanced
imagination and innovative thinking after exposure to the translated whale songs.
One of the most unexpected findings was the discovery that the model’s performance was significantly
improved when the training data was supplemented with recordings of dolphin clicks and elephant
rumblings. This seemingly bizarre approach resulted in a 37

In addition to the quantitative results, our study also uncovered some fascinating qualitative insights.
Many human subjects reported experiencing vivid, ocean-themed dreams after listening to the
generated music, with some even claiming to have gained a deeper understanding of the emotional
lives of whales. While these findings are admittedly anecdotal, they do suggest that the model’s
output is having a profound impact on human consciousness, one that extends far beyond the realm
of mere entertainment.
One potential explanation for these results is that the model is somehow tapping into the collective
unconscious, leveraging the primal, emotional resonance of whale song to access deep-seated creative
potential within the human psyche. This idea is supported by the fact that many of the generated
music pieces exhibit a strange, otherworldly quality, as if they are emanating from a realm beyond
the boundaries of human experience. While this hypothesis is certainly speculative, it does highlight
the vast, uncharted territories that await exploration at the intersection of artificial intelligence,
psychoacoustics, and human creativity.
In a surprising turn of events, our research team also discovered that the model’s performance was
influenced by the phase of the moon, with the generated music exhibiting a more ""lunar"" quality during
full moon periods. This finding has led us to speculate about the potential role of celestial bodies
in shaping the creative output of GANs, and has prompted us to embark on a new line of research
exploring the relationship between artificial intelligence, astrology, and the human imagination.
While this tangent may seem unrelated to the original research question, it does underscore the
complex, multifaceted nature of creativity, and the many mysteries that remain to be unraveled in this
fascinating field.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our research has demonstrated the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) in translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, with the ultimate goal of improving
human creativity. The psychoacoustic approach employed in this study has yielded intriguing results,
highlighting the complex relationships between auditory perception, emotional response, and creative
cognition. Notably, the incorporation of whale song as a stimulus has led to the development of
novel trance music patterns that defy conventional music theory, sparking debates about the role of
unconventional sound sources in shaping human creativity.
One unexpected finding was the discovery that the generated trance music exhibited a peculiar
resonance with the brain’s default mode network, which is typically associated with introspection
and self-reflection. This resonance was found to induce a state of deep relaxation in listeners, often
accompanied by vivid visualizations and enhanced imagination. While the underlying mechanisms are
5
not yet fully understood, this phenomenon has led us to propose the concept of ""sonic entrainment,""
where the rhythmic patterns and frequency modulations in the translated whale song somehow
synchronize with the brain’s intrinsic oscillations, facilitating a heightened state of creative receptivity.
Furthermore, our research has also explored the possibility of using the generated trance music as a
catalyst for creative problem-solving. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to listen
to the translated whale song while engaging in various creative tasks, such as painting, writing,
or composing music. The results showed a significant increase in creative output and innovation,
with many participants reporting a sense of increased inspiration and flow. However, a bizarre side
effect was observed, where some participants began to incorporate whale-like vocalizations into their
creative work, blurring the lines between human and animal expression. This unexpected tangent has
raised questions about the potential for interspecies creative collaboration and the role of biomimicry
in artistic expression.
In addition, our study has touched upon the idea that the translated whale song may possess inherent
therapeutic properties, capable of alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression. While this claim
may seem far-fetched, our preliminary findings suggest that the hypnotic trance music generated by
the GANs can indeed have a profound impact on mental well-being, possibly due to its ability to
modulate the brain’s stress response and promote relaxation. To further investigate this claim, we
propose the development of a new field of research, dubbed ""cetacean sound therapy,"" which would
explore the therapeutic potential of whale song and other marine animal vocalizations.
In retrospect, our research has not only demonstrated the feasibility of using GANs to translate
whale song into hypnotic trance music but has also opened up new avenues for interdisciplinary
research, spanning psychoacoustics, creativity studies, and marine biology. As we continue to push
the boundaries of this innovative approach, we may uncover even more surprising and counterintuitive
results, challenging our understanding of the complex relationships between sound, creativity, and
the human experience. Ultimately, the true potential of this research lies in its ability to inspire new
forms of artistic expression, foster creative collaboration between humans and animals, and perhaps
even unlock the secrets of the ocean’s most enigmatic creatures.

P083.pdf,"Disparate Citation Patterns Between Chinese and
American Research Communities at a Unified Venue
Abstract
At NeurIPS, there is a tendency for American and Chinese institutions to cite papers
from within their own regions substantially more often than they cite papers from
the other region. To measure this divide, we construct a citation graph, compare
it to European connectivity, and discuss both the causes and consequences of this
separation.

Introduction
In recent years, the machine learning research community has been transformed by the rise of
Chinese AI research. China is now consistently the second-largest contributor of publications at
NeurIPS, following the United States. In 2020, 13.6% of all NeurIPS publications came from Chinese
institutions. The next year, this increased to 17.5%, a relative increase of 28.7%.
Despite China’s position as a leader in AI research, collaborations between Chinese and American
institutions are less common than collaborations between American and Western European institutions.
Anecdotally, researchers from these regions often form distinct social groups at machine learning
conferences. This separation is not limited to just social interactions. A prominent professor in an
applied area of machine learning publicly advised students to avoid talks by Chinese authors, arguing
that their presentations would be difficult to understand or of poor quality. Although many non-native
English speakers find it a challenge to speak in public, avoiding talks by Chinese researchers may
limit a conference attendee’s exposure to new topics and ideas.
This study measures the separation between researchers in China and the United States. We use
NeurIPS citation data to analyze the impact of work from US-based and China-based institutions,
and find that Chinese institutions under-cite work from the US and Europe, and that both American
and European institutions under-cite work from China.

Citation Networks
2.1
Methods
To quantify the divide between the regions, we compiled a citation graph using NeurIPS paper
citation data from SemanticScholar and institutional information about authors from AMiner. We
first collected all paper titles from NeurIPS from 2012 to 2021 from the NeurIPS website. Using
the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API, we then mapped paper titles to their Semantic
Scholar paper IDs. For unmatched papers we manually searched, finding all but one in the Semantic
Scholar database. We then used the S2AG API to identify the authors of each paper as well as the
authors of papers referenced by these papers.
We used AMiner to identify institutional information for each author. The 9460 NeurIPS papers have
135,941 authors in total, of which we found institutions for 83,515 (61%). The 4038 papers lacking
author information were excluded from the dataset. We then automatically identified institutes that
included a country name, along with common cities and regions in China. We augmented these
automatic annotations with existing regional matchings and added 364 additional rules. Finally, we
.
removed major multinational corporate labs (e.g., Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba, or
Huawei). Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from China, the US, or
Europe, or included collaborators in multiple regions, leaving 1792 papers. Finally, we computed the
average number and proportion of citations between papers from each region, shown in Figure 1.
2.2
Results
We observed the extent to which American and Chinese papers fail to cite each other. While American
papers constitute 60% of our dataset, they only account for 34% of citations made by Chinese papers.
American citations of Chinese papers are even more striking: while Chinese papers account for
34% of our dataset, they are only cited in 9% of American references. This is more profound when
comparing these values to American citations of European papers: even though the dataset has
six times more Chinese than European papers, American institutions cite Chinese papers less than
European papers.
We also observe that each region tends to cite its own papers more often: 21% for China, 41% for
the USA, and 14% for Europe. The division between American and Chinese research communities
is much more pronounced than one would expect based on typical regional preferences. While
American and European research communities show similar citation behavior, Chinese institutions
cite American and European papers less than other regions.

Limitations
The conclusions we make in this paper are dependent on a few key choices we made during our data
selection process. First, while we consider institutions in the US as American, many US labs have
close ties to China, potentially underestimating the true divide. Some US labs are largely or entirely
made up of Chinese international students. Additionally, international students returning to their
home country may bring international connections, and we did not measure if their citation patterns
focus more on domestic papers or if they continue to cite American work. In addition, our filtering of
multinational corporate labs may be incomplete which could also affect our results.
Second, a number of papers were excluded from our analysis due to missing author information on
AMiner, which is a Chinese platform. This may have resulted in the number of Chinese papers in the
dataset being more than what there actually is. We discarded 43

Consequences
Though American and Chinese researchers publish in the same venues, they represent two parallel
communities. To some degree, this can be attributed to different research interests due to cultural
norms influencing research priorities. For instance, multi-object tracking is an active area of research
in China, with many large scale benchmarks. However, due to concerns surrounding privacy and
misuse, many North American researchers tend to avoid related topics. In general, the US tends to be
heavily represented at fairness conferences, while representation from China is limited.
Not only research topics are limited by this lack of exchange, but even abstract topics and architectures
that are popular in China are often not adopted in other regions. For example, PCANet, a popular
image classification architecture has most of its 1200 citations from Chinese or East Asian institutions.
Similarly, the Deep Forest model has garnered most of its 600 citations from Chinese researchers.
Recently, the North American and European AI communities have increasingly engaged in conversa-
tions regarding the ethical considerations of AI and have adopted review systems for ethical concerns
2
and required authors to include ethics statements. However, there has been limited engagement
with researchers from China regarding these topics, and ethics statements for Chinese-based AI
institutions are similar to western ones. Despite such statements, specific disagreements regarding
research practices still exist. For instance, while Duke University stopped providing the Duke-MTMC
dataset, due to the ethical issues with the collection process, similar datasets from Chinese institutions
continue to be actively used. This highlights the need for a discussion on the topic of the ethical
dimensions of AI research between different communities.
The separation between the research communities has an impact on both researchers and societies as
a whole. It is crucial that the AI community initiates a discussion to overcome this barrier.

P091.pdf,"An Investigation into Named Entity Recognition for
Call Center Transcripts to Ensure Privacy Law
Compliance
Abstract
This study explores the application of Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a
novel form of user-generated text, specifically call center conversations. These
dialogues present unique challenges, blending the complexities of spontaneous
speech with issues specific to conversational Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
such as inaccuracies. By employing a custom corpus with manual annotations,
training contextual string embeddings, and implementing a BiLSTM-CRF model,
we achieve results that are on par with the state-of-the-art for this new task.
1
Introduction
This paper addresses the crucial need to identify and handle sensitive personal information within
call center transcripts, which are generated as a result of speech recognition systems. Although these
transcripts are typically redacted for Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, they still often contain
a caller’s name and internal ID number, which can be useful for quality assurance. However, new
privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, establish stringent
guidelines concerning data collection, storage, and an individual’s right to withdraw consent for
data usage. To adhere to these regulations without losing the data’s value, it is essential to pinpoint
non-public personal and personally identifiable information (NPI/PII) in call transcripts.
We utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) to locate instances of NPI/PII within the transcripts,
remove them, and replace them with appropriate tags that denote the type of removed data. For
instance, a transcript such as ""This is john doe reference number 12345"" would be transformed into
""This is [NAME] reference number [NUMBER]"". This task is distinctive to call centers for several
reasons. First, these transcripts consist of natural human conversations, which have many common
problems of user-generated content such as incomplete sentences and unusual words. Furthermore,
transcript text is produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are susceptible to
errors, as will be described in Section 3.1. Even though modern ASR systems are usually reliable, the
source audio is from phone calls, which is often low quality and contains background noise. The poor
audio quality leads to incorrect ASR, producing ungrammatical sentences. This makes understanding
the call semantics and identifying features essential to NER systems more difficult. Moreover, call
transcripts frequently lack capitalization, numeric digits, and proper punctuation, which are crucial
features for classic NER methods. Also, traditional NER systems are inadequate for handling emails,
addresses, or spellings, which makes it difficult to use pre-trained NER models.
In this paper, we apply the current best neural network architecture for sequence labeling, a BiLSTM-
CRF, to the task of identifying NPI and PII in call transcripts. We match the state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on standard datasets by using our model with annotated data and custom contextual string
embeddings.

Related Work
Named Entity Recognition has become a focus in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
particularly since the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) in the 1990s. The CoNLL2003
shared task in 2003 concentrated on language-independent NER and popularized feature based
systems. The OntoNotes corpus, released in 2006, has been vital to the progress of NER research.
Following the CoNLL task, Conditional Random Field (CRF) based models became the most
successful, which requires that features be manually produced. Current research utilizes neural
networks to generate these features. Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory models with a CRF layer
(BiLSTM-CRF) have been used successfully on CoNLL2000 and CoNLL2003 datasets. A BiLSTM-
CNN-CRF has been used for NER on the CoNLL2003 dataset, producing superior results. Similar
results were achieved by a BiLSTM-CNN with features from word embeddings and the lexicon.
Embeddings have been used for both words and entity types to create more robust models. Flair, with
character-based embeddings and a pooling approach, has set the state of the art. Crossweigh uses
Flair embeddings to address mishandled annotations.
In 2006, the word confidence scores from ASR systems were used as a feature for NER. Similar
experiments were done on French radio and TV audio. Neither of those used natural conversation,
and the quality of the audio was superior, making ASR a more accurate task.
2.1
Conversations are Different: The Twitter Analogy
Much of the past research has used newswire datasets. While newswire data is expected to conform
to standard text conventions, call center transcripts do not have these conventions. This presents a
problem for the usual approaches to NER and is further complicated by our poor audio quality.

Speaker 2:
Id like to pay my bill.
Table 1: An example of turns of a conversation, where each person’s line in the dialogue represents
their turn. This output matches the format of our data described in Section 3.
The most similar research area to this is work on Twitter data. Similar to our transcripts, tweets are
user-generated and may not have conventional grammar or spelling. Initial research tackled this
problem with a K-nearest neighbors model combined with a CRF. A model combining a multi-step
neural network with a CRF output layer achieved first place in the 2017 Workshop on Noisy User-
generated Text (W-NUT). The success of pooled contextualized string embeddings was also shown
with this data. We use prior work on tweets to direct our model creation for call center data.
3
Data
Our dataset includes 7,953 training, 500 validation, and 534 test samples. Each sample represents
a complete speaker turn from a debt collection call center. A speaker turn is defined as a complete
transcription from one speaker before another speaker starts, as shown in Table 1. The training set is
a random sample of turns from 4 months of call transcripts. The transcripts were generated using a
proprietary speech recognition system, which outputs all lowercase transcripts without punctuation
or numeric digits. We used spaCy to convert each turn to a document that begins with a capital letter
and ends with a period, as this is the default for spaCy. In order to make use of entities, a Sentencizer
module was added, which defaults to this capitalization and period structure.
3.1
Data Annotation
We created a schema for annotating the training and validation data with different types of NPI/PII,
which are shown in Table 2.
Initial annotations were performed using Doccano. The annotators were trained in NPI/PII recognition,
and were instructed to err on the side of caution in unclear instances. Ambiguity often came from
errors in the ASR model. The lack of audio meant it was sometimes unclear if ""I need oak leaves""
was actually ""Annie Oakley"". The opposite was also true such as when ""Brilliant and wendy jeff to

were also difficult, as errors in ASR made it difficult to determine the bounds of the email address.
Also, the transcripts were pre-redacted for PCI compliance. This redaction can obscure important
data, for example, sometimes a customer ID is redacted as part of the PCI redaction process. To
lessen false negatives, we use context to include the [redacted] tag as part of the numbers sequence
when possible. No steps to clean the transcripts were taken; the natural noise in the data was left for
the model to interpret.
Due to limitations with spaCy and the complexity of nested entities, we only allowed one annotation
per word in the dataset. This means, for instance, that ""c a t as in team at gmail dot com"" would be
labeled either as SPELLING[0:6] EMAIL[6:] or as EMAIL[0:] with the indices corresponding to the
position of words in the text. This ultimately results in a lower count of SPELLING entities, because
these are often part of EMAIL or ADDRESS entities, which influences our analysis in Section 6.

Model Design
We utilized a standard BiLSTM-CRF model in PyTorch, adapted from a GitHub repository. We wrote
our own main.py to use our spaCy preprocessing, and adapted the code to handle batch processing.
After preprocessing, we trained the model on the training set and used the validation set for model
tuning. All numbers in this paper are reported on the test set. A visualization of our model is shown
in Figure 1.

Experiments
5.1
Basic Hyperparameter Tuning
We used a grid search algorithm to maximize model performance. The word embedding layer uses
FastText embeddings trained on the client’s call transcripts. This aids in mitigating the impacts of
poor ASR, and this will be explored in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. The grid search included the parameters:
epochs (a sampled distribution between 5 and 50), the size of a dropout layer (between 0 and 0.5,
with 0.1 intervals of search), the number of hidden layers (between 5 and 20 in increments of 5), and
the encoding type used in the output of the CRF (BIO, BILOU, IO). The other hyperparameters were
a learning rate of .001, a batch size of 1, 30 nodes in each fully connected layer, and the inclusion of
bias in each layer. The experiments were run in parallel on a virtual machine with 16 CPUs and 128
GB of memory. Each experiment took a few hours to run.
To understand the performance of the model, we broke down the measurements of precision, recall,
and F1 by entity type. Table 3 shows these results for the best model configuration. This model used
46 epochs, a dropout rate of 0.2, 5 hidden layers, and a BIO encoding.
5.2
Training Word Embeddings
Most past research has fine-tuned existing word embeddings, but the task of mitigating misrecognition
seemed more complex than domain adaptation. To lessen the impact of the errors, we understand that
frequent misrecognitions appear in contexts similar to the intended word. A custom model gives a
misrecognized word a vector similar to the word it should be and not to the other meaning it has. The
importance of domain specific word embeddings when using ASR data has been shown in research.

We ran our best performing model with the 300 dimensional GloVe 6b word embeddings. Our
embeddings were trained on roughly 216 million words. The results from the best epoch of this
model (16) are shown in Table 3.

5.3
Using Flair
Previous experiments highlighted the importance of custom word embeddings to account for mis-
recognition in call center transcripts. Here, we test the performance of Flair and its contextual string
embeddings.
We begin by training custom contextual string embeddings based on the results of the first experiments.
We use the same corpus as in Section 5.1. The tutorial on the Flair GitHub page was used with the
following parameters: hidden size: 1024, sequence length: 250, mini batch size: 100. We use the
newline to indicate a document change, and each turn as a separate document for consistency. The
model’s validation loss stabilized after epoch 4, and the best version of the model was used.
We conduct experiments using Flair’s SequenceTagger with default parameters and a hidden size of
256.
Flair uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings.
Flair + FastText uses the custom trained Flair embeddings and the custom trained FastText embeddings
using Flair’s StackedEmbeddings.
Flairmean pooling uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings within Flair’s PooledFlairEmbed-
ding. Mean pooling was used.
Flairmean pooling + FastText uses PooledFlairEmbeddings with mean pooling and the custom trained
FastText embeddings using Flair’s StackedEmbeddings.
These results are shown in Table 4.

Discussion
Table 3 shows that using custom embeddings is beneficial over using GloVe embeddings, with the
exception of the EMAIL category. The Flair embeddings show a large improvement over other word
embeddings; however all four varieties of Flair models have nearly identical Micro Average F1s. The
best performing Flair models are those that use both the custom contextualized string embeddings
and the custom FastText embeddings.
Across all of the models in this paper, EMAIL and SPELLING consistently performed worse than
other categories. This is due to the overlap in their occurrences and their variable appearance. The
custom embeddings model often identified parts of an email correctly but labeled some aspects, such
as a name, as NAME followed by EMAIL instead of labeling the whole thing as EMAIL. SPELLING
often appears within an EMAIL entity. Due to the previously discussed limitations, the SPELLING
entity had a limited presence in our training data, with many EMAIL and ADDRESS entities
containing examples of SPELLING. All models frequently misidentified EMAIL as SPELLING and
vice versa. Additionally, the test data had a number of turns that consisted of only SPELLING, which
was poorly represented in training. The Flairmean pooling model outperforms the other models in
EMAIL by a large margin.
The results in Table 4 highlight that the NUMBERS category contains strings that appear frequently
in the text. There are a finite number of NUMBER words in our corpus (those numeric words along
with many instances of ""[redacted]""), and the numbers of interest in our dataset appear in very similar
contexts and do not often get misrecognized. The COMPANY entity performs well for similar
reasons; when the model was able to identify the company name correctly, it was often in a common
error form and in a known context. The model’s failures can be attributed to the training data because
the company name is a proper noun that is not in standard ASR language models, including the one
we used. Thus, it is often misrecognized since the language model has higher probabilities assigned to
grammatically correct phrases that have nothing to do with the company name. This causes variability
in appearance, which means that not every version of the company name was present in our training
set.
Interesting variability also occurred in ADDRESS entities. Both models that used Flair and FastText
embeddings strongly outperformed the models that used only Flair, and standard Flair embeddings
strongly outperformed the Pooled Flair embeddings. Neither version of the Flair-only model identified
addresses in which numbers were shown as ""[redacted]"" but both models that utilized FastText had
no issue with these instances.

Conclusion and Future Work
Through the use of a BiLSTM-CRF model, paired with custom-trained Flair embeddings, we achieve
state-of-the-art NER performance on a new call center conversation dataset with distinct entity types.
We also show the importance of training word embeddings that fully capture the intricacies of the
task. Although we cannot release our data for privacy, we have shown that existing state-of-the-art
techniques can be applied to less common datasets and tasks. Future work will include evaluating
the model with call transcripts from other industries. We would also like to explore how well these
techniques work on other user-generated conversations like chats and emails.

P104.pdf,"Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of
Pre-Trained Language Models through Natural
Language Inference
Abstract
While large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often
lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw
question-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does
a bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this
failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation
Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained
NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without
fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several
candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for
both the model’s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and
the NLI model’s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that
a weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices
under this factor graph, improving over the raw model’s predictions. Our experi-
ments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of
off-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models,
notably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5

Introduction
Reliable and trustworthy AI systems should demonstrate internal self-consistency, in the sense that
their predictions across inputs should imply logically compatible beliefs about the world. However,
even powerful large language models are known to lack self-consistency. For example, a question-
answering (QA) model that answers the question Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet?
with Yes is implicitly expressing the belief that A sparrow is a bird and A bird has feet. If the
same model answers the question Does a sparrow have feet? with No, the model expresses the
logically incompatible belief A sparrow does not have feet. In such cases, ascertaining the model’s
˘201ctrue˘201d belief is difficult, making interpreting and validating its behavior correspondingly
challenging.
Prior work has improved model self-consistency by training with specialized loss functions or data
augmentation, or alternatively re-ranking model predictions based on their mutual self-consistency
using pre-written logical constraints, such as ˘201call mammals have fur˘201d. However, the first class
of methods requires expensive fine-tuning which might be impractical for many practitioners for
very large pre-trained models, and re-ranking methods require an explicit collection of the logical
relations of interest, making scaling a challenge. Still, re-ranking-based approaches have the benefit
of not requiring fine-tuning, and we hypothesize that their scalability limitations may be addressed by
estimating logical relationships between model predictions on the fly. Specifically, we hypothesize
that existing pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models can estimate logical relationships
between an arbitrary pair of model predictions well enough to provide an effective, scalable substitute
for explicit collection of such constraints. Leveraging these estimated constraints, we can construct
a factor graph representing a probability distribution over model outputs that incorporates both the
original model’s confidence scores and the NLI model’s beliefs about logical relationships.
Our primary contribution is Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, a
framework to improve the consistency and performance of a pre-trained base language model without
fine-tuning by using more confident and better attested model predictions to override less confident
model beliefs. To enable propagation of model beliefs, we estimate pair-wise logical relationships
between model predictions using a pre-trained NLI model. Using these pair-wise relationships, we
define an undirected graphical model representing a distribution over responses accounting for both
the base model’s beliefs and the NLI model’s estimates of answer compatibility. We efficiently find
the approximate mode of this distribution among the base model’s top answer choices for each input
as the solution of a MaxSAT problem, which consistently produces more accurate and self-consistent
predictions than using the raw model predictions. We find that ConCoRD produces an 8.1

Related Work
Prior work for maintaining consistency in the question-answering space often involves additional
training to improve performance. Some work generates questions from unlabeled texts, then filters
them to ensure roundtrip consistency; pre-training on this synthetic set improves performance on
SQuAD 2.0 and Natural Questions. Other work augments QA-pairs with their logically symmetric
and transitive counterparts through linguistic approaches to enhance cross-dataset QA performance.
ConCoRD differs significantly from these question-answering-specific approaches because no fine-
tuning of the base model is needed and the methodology is not specific to question-answering.
Similarly to ConCoRD, other work re-rank model predictions by solving an optimization problem
defined by a combination of the base model confidence scores and pair-wise constraints representing
the logical compatibility of different model predictions stored in a persistent memory, which they
call BeliefBank. The key distinguishing property of ConCoRD is the fact that pair-wise constraints
between model predictions are dynamically estimated by a pre-trained NLI model, rather than drawn
from a fixed, pre-collected set of constraints. Dynamically estimating the constraints has a variety of
benefits, eliminating the need for manually collecting the logical constraints of interest, automating
the process of determining whether a particular constraint applies to a particular pair of predictions,
and likely inheriting improvements in Natural language inference (NLI) models over time.
NLI has long been used to maintain logical consistency in generated dialogue utterances, radiology
report domain entities, and summarization. Perhaps most similarly, other work uses NLI to estimate
constraints between factual statements produced by GPT-3. These prior approaches support our
intuition for using NLI models to improve logical consistency among batches of answers. While the
authors explore applications of this framework to multi-step reasoning for True/False questions or
statements, our work focuses on applying this methodology to more general settings, such as VQA,
open-ended QA, and model editing.

Consistency Correction through Relation Detection
ConCoRD contains three key components, the base model, a relation model (typically a pre-trained
NLI model), and an inference procedure that combines the predictions of the two models into a more
accurate and self-consistent set of beliefs. Importantly, both the base model and relation model are
pre-trained, off-the-shelf models; ConCoRD does not update any weights or require training data
for either model, using only a small validation set for hyperparameter tuning. We next explain the
function of each of these components when executing ConCoRD.
3.1
Base Model
The core function of the base model in ConCoRD is generating a set of candidate outputs for a given
input, which are ultimately re-ranked by the inference process (Sec. 3.3). Given a batch of N model
queries Q = {qi}, the first step of ConCoRD is to generate a set of J candidate outputs for each query
ˆAi = {ˆai1, ..., ˆaiJ}, along with their corresponding likelihoods pθ(ˆaij|qi). Note that the candidate
outputs need not be an IID sample from the base model; for example, we might use beam search
with a diversity bonus to produce a more diverse set of candidates. Each pair of query and candidate
2
output forms a model belief bij = (qi, ˆaij); the output of the base model is the complete set of model
beliefs B = {bij} and their corresponding normalized probabilities pij. The base models in our
experiments are pre-trained question-answering models based on T5-large and pre-trained visual
question-answering models such as LXMERT and ViLT.
3.2
Relation Model
The relation model pθ(: |xi, x′) estimates the most likely logical relationship between an ordered pair
of natural language utterances from the choices {none, fwd −entail, contradict, equivalence}.
In addition to the model beliefs B, we define optional context statements cijk = C(bij), K relevant
statements that may be retrieved, generated, or manually written for each model belief. The ability
to incorporate context statements enables ConCoRD to modulate model behavior independently for
each input in the test batch, rather than reasoning transductively about pairs of test inputs. Inputs
to the relation model are either pairs of two model beliefs (bij, bi′j′) or pairs of one model belief
and one context statement (bij, cijk). We define the most likely inter-belief relation as rij,i′j′ =
argmaxrpθ(r|bij, bi′j′), and similarly for belief-context relations rij,k = argmaxrpθ(r|bij, cijk).
The output of the relation model is the set of most-likely relations R = {rij,i′j′} ∪{rij,k} and
their associated probabilities, which we denote as pij,i′j′
ϕ
and pij,k
ϕ
. Our experiments use various
pre-trained NLI models based on RoBERTa and ALBERT as the relation model.
Question-answer to statement conversion. While concatenating query qi and candidate output ˆaij
to produce inputs to the relation model is perhaps the simplest approach to estimating soft constraints,
we use a statement conversion model to provide inputs to the relation model that are closer to its
training distribution. Instead of defining the belief bij = (qi, ˆaij) as concatenation of qi and ˆaij, we
define bij to be the statement fϕ(qi, ˆaij), where fϕ is the conversion model. We fine-tune a small
T5 model on a combination of data from and BeliefBank to produce a model that maps a (question,
answer) pair into a natural language statement.
3.3
Inference
ConCoRD’s inference procedure maps the set of beliefs B and pair-wise relations R into a choice
of the most likely belief for each question. To define the inference problem, we first define a binary
decision variable zij representing the estimated truth value of model belief bij. A value of 1 for node
zij in the maximum likelihood configuration means that ˆaij is returned for query qi; the problem
includes a constraint that exactly one candidate answer is true for each query. The factor graph
includes the set of variables Z = {zij}N,J
i,j=1,1 and various factors (functions mapping a subset of
Z to a non-negative scalar) derived from the base model and relation model’s beliefs and the hard
constraint of returning only one answer per question. Factors are defined such that more desirable
configurations of zij yield a larger product of the individual factors. First, unary factors ϕij(zij)
encode the base model’s beliefs about the likelihood of specific answers, and are defined as:
ϕij(zij) = { p ij ifzij = 11 −pijotherwise
(1)
where pij = pθ(ˆaij|qi); in other words, the factor takes the odds ratio if the corresponding statement
variable zij is assigned a truth value of 1; otherwise, the factor takes value 1. In order to encode the
hard constraint that exactly one output should be returned for each query, we include a J-ary factor
ϕi(Zi) for each group of nodes Zi = {zij}J
j=1, which is equal to 1 for configurations where exactly
one of the nodes takes a value of 1, and 0 for all other configurations.
Binary factors ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) and optionally ψijk(zij, cijk) encode compatibility between pairs of
model beliefs (or model belief-context pairs):
ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) = { 1 ifrij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′)pij,i′j′
ϕ
otherwise
(2)
where we define the relation function rij,i′j′ to evaluate to true if its arguments satisfy the underlying
relation, and false otherwise; ψijk(zij, cijk) is defined similarly to ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′). The inference
problem amounts to finding argmaxZΦ(Z), where
Φ(Z) =
Y
i
ϕi
Y

An approximate solution to this inference problem can be efficiently found for most problems with a
MaxSAT solver such as RC2. We omit arguments to the factors for conciseness.
Entailment correction. Consider a belief b, a set of its entailed statements S = {si}, unary
factors ϕ(zb) and {ϕ(zsi)}, and binary factors Ψ = {ψ(zb, zsi)}i. Recall that an entailment relation
rij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) is satisfied (and the binary factor is maximized) if either zb = 0 or all zsi = 1.
Consequently, as the cardinality of {zs|zsi = 0} increases, the more likely it is that zb = 0 will
maximize the product of all binary factors Q
i ψ(zb, zsi). This is true even if most entailed statements
are true, ie., |{zs|zsi = 1}| > |{zs|zsi = 0}|. If most of the statements entailed by a belief are
true, assigning the belief to be false due to a small number of (potentially spuriously) false entailed
statements may be undesirable. To mitigate this outcome, we experiment with an additional type of
factor in which configurations satisfying entailments with both zb = 1 and zsi = 1 are ’rewarded’
more than other configurations satisfying the entailment:
Ψb,si(zb, zsi) = { 1 ifzb, zsi = 11 −pb,si
ϕ
ifzb, zsi = 0
q
1 −pb,si
ϕ
otherwise
(4)
Applying entailment correction consistently improves ConCoRD’s performance.
3.4
Hyperparameters of ConCoRD
We introduce two key hyperparameters to ConCoRD. Because we do not know a priori the relative
reliability of the base model and relation model, we introduce the hyperparameter δ ∈[0, 1], corre-
sponding to a trade-off between the predictions of the base model and relation model. A value of
δ = 1 corresponds to simply taking the raw predictions of the base model, while δ = 0 corresponds to
optimizing purely for answers that are self-consistent according to the relation model, without consid-
ering the base model’s beliefs. The unary factors in the factor graph become ϕi(zi) = (ϕij(zij))δ and
ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′) = (ψij,i′j′(zij, zi′j′))1−δ (and similarly for ψijk). In addition to δ, we introduce a
threshold λ for relation model confidence to filter out low-confidence relation estimates. That is, we
discard a relation rij,i′j′ or rij,k if pij,i′j′
ϕ
< λ or pij,k
ϕ
< λ, respectively. In practice, we find that the
optimal δ and λ vary across problems, perhaps due to the varying complexity of the model belief and
context statements (and therefore the reliability of the relation model’s predictions). Therefore, we
use the hyperopt library for automated hyperparameter optimization, using the Tree Parzen Estimator
(TPE) algorithm to tune δ and λ jointly. We use the optimal hyperparameters found on the validation
data for each problem to compute test performance.

Experiments
Our experiments are broadly designed to answer the high-level question: can ConCoRD leverage the
relational knowledge in pre-trained NLI models to produce more accurate, self-consistent system
behavior, without additional data or fine-tuning? Further, we investigate ConCoRD’s applicability to
performing test-time model editing, or injection of new information, and ConCoRD’s sensitivity to
the choice of hyperparameters and types of relations detected.
4.1
Internal Consistency in Closed-Book Question-Answering
Protocol. To evaluate the accuracy and consistency of a set B of beliefs, we synthesize a gold standard
for those beliefs and the inferred relations R. Following this prior work, we assume the following is
given:
• A set of entities sm ∈S
• A set of unary predicates Pn ∈P
• A collection of ˘201cfacts˘201d (Pn(sm))i, whose binary truth value is known
• A directed graph of gold-standard constraints G(P, E), whose edges (Pi, Pj) ∈E represent
first-order logical formulae
From these, we construct simple yes/no questions using natural language templates. For example,
for fact Pn(sm), if entity sm represents a lion and predicate Pn represents an ability to drink liquids,
4
the template-generated gold question answer pair (qi, ai) is Q: Is it true that a lion is able to drink
liquids?; A: Yes.
We evaluate ConCoRD by sampling candidate answers from the top-2 output sizes of a multi-angle
question answering model, given a multiple choice angle with choices Yes and No. The questions
and retrieved answers (qi, ˆai) form a set of beliefs Bsm for each entity. Since these are closed-book
questions, no context statements are supplied; because they are yes/no questions, only one candidate
answer is obtained, i.e., J = 1. Question-answer to statement conversion is applied to all questions
with a default answer of Yes regardless of the answer ˆai, in order to provide the relation model with
positive natural language assertions from which to infer sets of relations Rsm; where the base model
answers ˆai are No we replace node zi in the factor graph with its complement. Configurations Zsm
are found for each sm ∈S which maximize Equation 2 given Bsm, Rsm and together form a global
solution Z.
Datasets. We use a database with 12,636 facts (˘201csilver facts˘201d), each indicating whether one of
601 predicates relates to one of 85 entities, as well as 4,060 confidence-weighted first-order constraints
manually gathered from ConceptNet, forming a constraint graph G. Additionally, they provide 1,072
distinct ˘201ccalibration facts˘201d, each relating one of 7 entities to one of 334 predicates.
We tune β and λ using a validation set of questions generated from the calibration facts, and evaluate
test time performance with questions generated from silver facts.
Metrics. We measure accuracy using binary F1 between elements zi of the configuration Z maxi-
mizing ϕ(Z) (as in Equation 2), and the truth value of facts (Pn(sm))i. We use F1 for evaluation
because gold answers are highly biased towards true No answers.
We compute consistency within batches of questions using the complement of of conditional constraint
violation metric τ, defined here as the proportion of relevant gold constraints in G which are violated;
a constraint ∀(Pi(x) →Pj(x)) is relevant iff, for some entity s, there is some belief bi ∈B, sm
from fact (Pi(sm))i such that zi = 1, and there is some belief bj ∈Bsm that corresponds to fact
(Pj(sm))j; the constraint is violated when zj = 0.
Comparisons. ConCoRD is evaluated against a naive baseline where only base model answers ˆai
and probabilities are considered. A second baseline (G.C.) performs the inference described in Sec.
3.3, replacing the inferred relations R with the gold constraints from constraint graph G, rather than
those estimated by the relation model.
Results. Results are shown in Table 1. ConCoRD provides an absolute improvement of over
8% in F1 and consistency for Macaw-Large and 7% for Macaw-3B compared to the baseline.
Notably, the margin of superiority of the Macaw-3B base model is mostly preserved after applying
ConCoRD, suggesting that ConCoRD may provide a significant benefit even for very large models.
A surprising result is that ConCoRD shows marked improvements in F1 over the gold constraint
baseline, suggesting that the detection and filtering of relations ConCoRD provides may, in this
setting, be an improvement over rigid adherence to the logical connections specified a priori.

Internal Consistency in VQA
Protocol. The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task involves a language model generating answers
to questions that are directly associated with images. VQA tests for robustness and generalizability
of ConCoRD as it introduces an additional layer of difficulty; the task moves away from purely
text-based tasks while expanding the answer space to the vocabulary of the LM being used. The
questions from the ConVQA dataset and its associated images from the Visual Genome dataset
5
provide an apt setting to assess ConCoRD, as the relatedness of questions for each image provide
ample opportunity for model self-inconsistency.
The ConVQA dataset consists of a set of images each associated with a group of related questions
about the image, such as What color is the horse? and Is the horse brown? for a picture of a brown
horse in a stable. We evaluate ConCoRD with two VQA models, LXMERT and ViLT. For each group
of questions Qn = {qni}i, we sample the top-2 candidate outputs {ˆani1, ˆani2} for each question,
and use a pre-trained NLI model to infer the most likely pair-wise relations R between outputs from
different questions. We use the RC2 MaxSAT Solver to estimate the configuration that maximizes
Equation 2.
Metrics. We report accuracy as the proportion of questions answered correctly across all groups.
We infer consistency using a metric previously used in the literature for the ConVQA dataset called
˘201cperfect consistency˘201d. For all groups of related questions, a group is perfectly consistent if
all its questions are answered correctly. Perfect consistency then reports the proportion of question
groups that were perfectly consistent. While this is not a perfect measure of consistency as it excludes
cases in which incorrect answers are consistent with each other, it still serves as a meaningful proxy
since the dataset was designed such that any incorrect answer in a question group implies the presence
of inconsistency.
Datasets. We divide the ConVQA dataset into a ˘201cclean˘201d (i.e. human verified and filtered)
test set and a non-test set (train + val + test as defined by previous work). From the non-test set, we
sample 10,000 random images equivalent to 123,746 questions to be used as our validation set for
tuning our two hyperparameters. We use the clean test set ˘2013 725 images and 6,751 questions ˘2013
to report our final results.
Comparisons. ConCoRD is compared with a naive baseline and a top-2 oracle upper bound. The
naive baseline is the answer with the highest VQA model probability. Top-2 oracle upper bound
selects the correct answer if present within the top-2 predictions of the VQA model. Top-2 is
appropriate given our use of the top-2 candidate outputs to generate inferences with NLI models.
Results. The final results for ConCoRD, baseline, and oracle upper bound are shown in Table
2. ConCoRD increases the accuracy of LXMERT and ViLT by 5% and 2% respectively, and the
consistency of LXMERT and ViLT by 4.9% and 5.9% respectively.

models with and without ConCoRD. ConCoRD significantly improves accuracy and consistency of
both models. Oracle performance is top-2 performance, as ConCoRD attempts to select the best of
the top 2 answer choices of the base model.

Test-Time Information Injection
Protocol. We perform an additional experiment to evaluate ConCoRD’s ability to integrate external
factual information into its inference process, rather than only using other predictions in the test
batch. Such an ability enables editing a model’s behavior at test time, without re-training, as new
information becomes available. We use the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, rather than BeliefBank,
to provide more challenging inputs to the relation model. Given a question from NQ, a sentence
from the ground truth context document containing information about the answer is retrieved and
provided as an additional input to ConCoRD; we constrain the node representing this context variable
in the factor graph to be true. Constraints are predicted between each answer choice and the context
statement. As in the other experimental settings, hyperparameters are tuned on the validation set and
applied on the test set.
Metrics. Model performance is evaluated using the SQuAD F1 score for overlapping tokens, follow-
ing the same answer normalization protocols, including lower-casing and removing punctuation.
6
Datasets. The NQ development set consists of 7830 open-book question-answer pairs, with both
long and short gold annotations in their context passages. Since the NQ test set is not available, we
create a test and validation set from the NQ validation questions as follows: we take the first 5000
questions to form our test set, and the rest to be our val set, which we use for hyperparameter tuning.
Then each set is filtered such that only the answerable questions remain. ˘201cAnswerable˘201d is
defined as having a ˘201cshort answer¨span defined in the annotations. This filtering process gives
2713 test entries and 1576 val entries.
Comparisons. ConCoRD is compared with a naive baseline and an oracle upper bound. All of
these approaches operate on the fixed set of QA model answers for a specific QA model (one of
T5-Sm-NQ, T5-Lg-NQ, and T5-3B-NQ), specifically the set of top-4 answers for each question. The
naive baseline selects the answer with the highest QA model probability, argmaxˆaijpθ(ˆaij|qi). The
oracle upper bound approach selects the answer that has the best score with the gold short answer
span, argmaxˆaijF1(ˆaij, aij).
Results. The results on the test set using the naive baseline, ConCoRD, and oracle upper-bound
are reported in Table 4. ConCoRD always outperforms the naive approach, demonstrating that the
framework is useful even when each query input is processed independently (i.e., non-transductively).
However, despite providing a relative gain of as high as 8.7% over the naive baseline, there is still a
gap between ConCoRD and the oracle. This gap may be attributable to the complexity of the NQ
questions and context information compared with the statements in prior experimental settings. Other
work demonstrates a significant gain in calibration performance from training on MultiNLI to training
on a combination of MultiNLI and their NLI corpus adapted from NQ, perhaps hinting that crucial
knowledge present in Natural Questions is not covered in MultiNLI, partially explaining the gap
between ConCoRD and oracle F1 performance. Overall, these results suggest that ConCoRD can
reason between context statements and model beliefs in addition to pairs of model beliefs, improving
performance even with the increased complexity of the data.

Injecting gold Natural Questions contexts consistently improves performance over the base model
without requiring fine-tuning.

Ablating Relation Types
Given that we consider two types of relations in our experiments, contradiction and entailment, it is
natural to wonder the relative contribution of these to ConCoRD’s performance improvement; Table
5 shows the results of this ablation. We re-run ConCoRD with either entailment or contradiction
relations removed, re-tuning the hyperparameters for both of the new settings (contradiction-only
or entailment-only). We find that the relative contribution of contradiction and entailment relations
varies significantly across models even within the same task, but using both relation types always
performs approximately as well or better than using just one, suggesting that both types of detected
relations from the NLI model carry useful information. However, we observe in several cases, such
as ViLT and the T5 models, that the entailment and contradiction relations may encode somewhat
redundant information, as the performance when including either type of constraint alone nearly
matches that of using both types.

Conclusion
This paper presents a novel method, ConCoRD, for enhancing the self-consistency and performance
of pre-trained language models without requiring fine-tuning. ConCoRD leverages pre-trained NLI
models to estimate logical relationships between model predictions and uses a MaxSAT solver to
enforce consistency. The experimental results demonstrate that ConCoRD improves over off-the-shelf

P090.pdf,"Equivariant Fine-Tuning of Large Pretrained Models
Abstract
This paper explores the adaptation of large pretrained models to new tasks while
preserving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, the property of a
model’s output changing predictably with transformations of its input, is crucial for
many applications, such as image recognition and physics simulations. However,
standard adaptation techniques, like fine-tuning, often disrupt this crucial property,
leading to a degradation in performance and generalization. We propose a novel
method that leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adap-
tation process, ensuring that the adapted model remains equivariant. Our approach
combines techniques from group theory and deep learning to achieve this goal.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets,
showing significant improvements over existing adaptation techniques. The results
highlight the importance of preserving equivariance during model adaptation and
showcase the potential of our approach for a wide range of applications.
1
Introduction
This paper addresses the critical challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while pre-
serving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, a crucial characteristic where a model’s
output transforms predictably with input transformations, is essential for numerous applications,
including image recognition, physics simulations, and various other domains involving structured
data. Standard adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning, often inadvertently disrupt this vital property,
leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization capabilities. This disruption stems
from the fact that these methods typically ignore the underlying group structure inherent in many
datasets, treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. The consequence
is a loss of the inherent symmetries and relationships that are crucial for robust and generalizable
performance.
Our work introduces a novel approach that directly addresses this limitation. We propose a method that
explicitly leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuring
that the adapted model retains its equivariance. This is achieved by incorporating a carefully designed
regularization scheme derived from group representation theory. This regularization term is integrated
into the standard fine-tuning process, acting as a constraint that encourages the adapted model to
respect the underlying group symmetries. The key innovation lies in the explicit consideration of the
group structure, allowing us to effectively guide the adaptation process while preserving the valuable
equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods
that treat the adaptation problem as a purely data-driven optimization problem, neglecting the rich
structural information embedded within the data.
The proposed method builds upon recent advancements in equivariant neural networks, which
have demonstrated significant promise in various domains. However, existing equivariant network
architectures primarily focus on training models from scratch. Our contribution lies in extending
these techniques to the adaptation setting, enabling us to harness the knowledge encoded in large
pretrained models while simultaneously maintaining equivariance. This allows us to leverage the
substantial computational investment already made in training these large models, avoiding the need
.
for extensive training from scratch. The combination of pretrained model knowledge and equivariance
preservation offers a powerful approach to efficient and effective model adaptation.
We evaluate our method on a diverse range of benchmark datasets encompassing image classification,
object detection, and physics simulation tasks. Our results consistently demonstrate the superiority
of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. We
observe significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data regimes,
highlighting the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable model adaptation.
Furthermore, our detailed analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively
prevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process, validating the core principle of
our approach.
In conclusion, this paper presents a novel and effective method for adapting large pretrained models
while preserving their valuable equivariance properties. Our approach offers a significant advancement
in model adaptation, enabling the efficient and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider
range of applications. The results demonstrate the importance of considering group symmetries
during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our method for various domains. Future work
will focus on extending our method to more complex group structures and exploring its applications
in other challenging scenarios.

Related Work
This section reviews existing literature relevant to our work on equivariant adaptation of large
pretrained models. Our approach builds upon two primary lines of research: (1) the development
of equivariant neural networks and (2) the adaptation of pretrained models. We discuss these areas
separately and then highlight the key distinctions of our proposed method.
The field of equivariant neural networks has witnessed significant progress in recent years. These
networks are designed to explicitly incorporate group symmetries into their architecture, ensuring
that the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the input. Various architectures
have been proposed, including those based on group convolutions, tensor representations, and other
techniques. These methods have demonstrated impressive results in various domains, such as image
classification, point cloud processing, and scientific simulations. However, most existing work
focuses on training equivariant networks from scratch, which can be computationally expensive and
require large amounts of labeled data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on adapting
pretrained models, leveraging the knowledge encoded in these models while preserving equivariance.
The adaptation of pretrained models is a well-established area of research in deep learning. Techniques
such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been widely used to adapt pretrained
models to new tasks and domains. These methods typically involve adjusting the weights of the
pretrained model on a smaller dataset specific to the target task. However, standard adaptation
techniques often fail to preserve the equivariance properties of the pretrained model, leading to
performance degradation. This is because these methods typically treat the data as unstructured
points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying group structure. Our work addresses this
limitation by explicitly incorporating the group structure into the adaptation process, ensuring that
the adapted model retains its equivariance.
Several works have explored the intersection of equivariance and model adaptation. For instance,
some studies have investigated adapting equivariant networks to new tasks using techniques such
as knowledge distillation or meta-learning. However, these methods often involve significant mod-
ifications to the network architecture or training process. Our approach offers a more direct and
efficient method for preserving equivariance during adaptation, by incorporating a regularization term
derived from group representation theory into the standard fine-tuning process. This allows us to
leverage the benefits of both pretrained models and equivariant networks without requiring significant
architectural changes.
In contrast to previous work, our method uniquely combines the strengths of pretrained models and
equivariant neural networks within a unified adaptation framework. We leverage the knowledge
encoded in large pretrained models to accelerate the adaptation process and improve performance,
while simultaneously preserving the crucial equivariance properties through a carefully designed
regularization scheme. This allows us to achieve superior performance and generalization compared
2
to existing adaptation techniques, particularly in low-data regimes where preserving the inherent
symmetries of the data is crucial. Our approach provides a powerful and efficient method for adapting
large pretrained models to new tasks while maintaining their valuable equivariance properties.

Methodology
This section details the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. Our
approach leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process,
ensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties. This is achieved through a novel
regularization scheme integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. The core idea is to constrain
the adaptation process such that the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the
input, even after adaptation to a new task. This contrasts with traditional fine-tuning, which often
disrupts these crucial symmetries. We achieve this by explicitly incorporating knowledge of the
group structure into the optimization process, rather than treating the data as unstructured points in
a high-dimensional space. The method is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of
pretrained models and group structures. The computational cost is a consideration, particularly for
large models and complex groups, but the benefits in terms of improved generalization and robustness
often outweigh this cost. Further optimization strategies are explored in the discussion section.
Our method begins by identifying the relevant group structure inherent in the data. This involves
determining the appropriate group actions and representations that capture the symmetries of the input
and output spaces. For example, in image processing, this might involve the group of rotations and
translations. Once the group structure is identified, we construct a regularization term based on group
representation theory. This term penalizes deviations from equivariance during the adaptation process.
Specifically, the regularization term measures the discrepancy between the model’s output under a
group action and the transformed output predicted by the model. This discrepancy is minimized
during training, ensuring that the adapted model remains approximately equivariant. The strength of
the regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, allowing for a trade-off between equivariance
preservation and adaptation to the new task. The choice of this hyperparameter is crucial and is
determined through cross-validation.
The regularization term is incorporated into the standard fine-tuning loss function. The overall loss
function is then a weighted sum of the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) and the
equivariance regularization term. The weights determine the relative importance of task performance
and equivariance preservation. The adapted model is trained by minimizing this combined loss
function using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
The specific optimization algorithm and hyperparameters are chosen based on the characteristics
of the dataset and the pretrained model. Careful selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for
achieving optimal performance. We employ a grid search to identify the best hyperparameter settings
for each experiment.
The implementation of our method involves modifying the standard fine-tuning process to include
the equivariance regularization term. This requires access to the pretrained model’s weights and
architecture, as well as the group representation associated with the data. The regularization term
is computed efficiently using techniques from group representation theory, minimizing the com-
putational overhead. The modified training process is implemented using standard deep learning
frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility
and further research. The implementation details, including the specific group representations and
optimization strategies, are provided in the supplementary material.
Finally, the adapted model is evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance on the new
task. The evaluation metrics are chosen based on the specific task, such as accuracy for classification
or mean average precision (mAP) for object detection. The performance of the adapted model is
compared to that of models adapted using traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation
techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving equivariance while
achieving high performance on the new task. A detailed analysis of the results is presented in the
next section.

Experiments
This section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed
method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a variety of
tasks and datasets, comparing its performance against traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art
adaptation techniques. Our experiments focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the target tasks, particularly in low-data
regimes. We also analyze the impact of the proposed regularization scheme on the adapted model’s
equivariance properties. The results highlight the importance of considering group symmetries
during model adaptation and showcase the potential of our approach for various applications. The
computational cost of our method is also considered, and strategies for mitigating this are discussed.
Our experiments involve three distinct tasks: image classification, object detection, and a physics
simulation task involving the prediction of fluid dynamics. For image classification, we utilize the
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adapting pretrained ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B7
models. The group structure considered is the group of rotations and translations, represented using
appropriate group convolutions. For object detection, we employ the COCO dataset and adapt
a pretrained Faster R-CNN model. Here, the group structure is again the group of rotations and
translations, but the regularization is adapted to the specific architecture of the object detection
model. Finally, for the physics simulation task, we use a dataset of fluid flow simulations, adapting
a pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure in this case is the group of spatial
translations and reflections. In all cases, we carefully select the hyperparameters of our method,
including the regularization strength and optimization algorithm, using cross-validation.
The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and
other adaptation techniques. Table 1 summarizes the performance of our method across the three
tasks, showing significant improvements in accuracy and generalization performance, especially
in low-data regimes. The improvements are particularly noticeable in scenarios where preserving
equivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated images. This highlights
the importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation. Furthermore,
our analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively prevents the disruption of
equivariance during the adaptation process, as measured by the discrepancy between the model’s
output under group actions and the transformed output. This validates the core principle of our
approach.

The computational cost of our method is a consideration, particularly for large models and complex
group structures. However, the significant improvements in performance and generalization often
outweigh this cost. We explore strategies for mitigating the computational overhead, such as using
efficient group convolution implementations and employing techniques like stochastic optimization.
Further research is needed to optimize the computational efficiency of our method, particularly for
extremely large models and complex group structures. Despite this, the results presented demonstrate
the significant potential of our approach for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models to new
tasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the computational efficiency and exploring
applications to even more complex scenarios.

Results
This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariantly
adapting large pretrained models. We conducted experiments across three diverse tasks: image
classification, object detection, and physics simulation. Our primary goal was to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the
4
target tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. We compared our method against traditional fine-tuning
and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, focusing on metrics that reflect both task performance
and the preservation of equivariance. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our
approach, highlighting the importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model
adaptation.
For image classification, we used the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, adapting pretrained ResNet-
50 and EfficientNet-B7 models. The group structure considered was the group of rotations and
translations, implemented using group convolutions. Table 2 shows the classification accuracy
achieved by our method, compared to fine-tuning and a state-of-the-art adaptation technique (Method
A). Our method consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving a significant improvement in
accuracy, especially in the low-data regime (10% of the training data). This improvement is attributed
to the preservation of equivariance, which enhances the model’s ability to generalize to unseen
rotations and translations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our regularization scheme in
maintaining the model’s equivariance properties while adapting to the new task.

In object detection experiments using the COCO dataset and a pretrained Faster R-CNN model,

Table 3 shows the mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved by different methods. Our method
significantly outperforms both fine-tuning and Method A, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach in preserving equivariance in a more complex task. The improvement in mAP suggests
that our method enhances the model’s robustness to variations in object pose and location. This is
particularly important in real-world scenarios where objects may appear in various orientations and
positions.

Finally, for the physics simulation task involving fluid dynamics, we used a dataset of fluid flow
simulations and adapted a pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure was spatial
translations and reflections. Our method achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.75,
significantly lower than the 0.88 RMSE achieved by fine-tuning and the 0.82 RMSE achieved by
Method A. This demonstrates the applicability of our approach to tasks beyond image processing
and its effectiveness in preserving equivariance in complex physical systems. The lower RMSE
indicates improved accuracy in predicting fluid dynamics, highlighting the benefits of preserving the
underlying symmetries of the physical system during model adaptation. The consistent improvements
across diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further
analysis, including visualizations of the adapted models’ responses to group actions, is provided in
the supplementary material.

Conclusion
This paper presents a novel method for adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving
their inherent equivariance properties. Standard adaptation techniques often disrupt this crucial
property, leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization. Our approach directly
addresses this limitation by explicitly leveraging the underlying group structure of the data to
guide the adaptation process. This is achieved through a carefully designed regularization scheme,
5
derived from group representation theory, that is integrated into the standard fine-tuning process.
This regularization term penalizes deviations from equivariance, ensuring that the adapted model
maintains its predictable transformation behavior under group actions on the input.
Our method builds upon recent advances in equivariant neural networks, extending these techniques
to the adaptation setting. This allows us to leverage the knowledge encoded in large pretrained models
while simultaneously preserving equivariance, offering a powerful approach to efficient and effective
model adaptation. We evaluated our method on diverse benchmark datasets encompassing image
classification, object detection, and physics simulation tasks. The results consistently demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation
techniques, showing significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data
regimes. This highlights the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable
model adaptation.
The consistent improvements across diverse tasks and datasets strongly support the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Our analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively
prevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process. This validates the core principle
of our approach: that explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation leads to
superior performance and generalization. The observed improvements are particularly significant in
scenarios where preserving equivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated
images or in tasks involving structured data with inherent symmetries.
While our method demonstrates significant improvements, there are limitations to consider. The
computational cost can be relatively high, especially for large models and complex group structures.
Future work will focus on developing more efficient algorithms to address this limitation, potentially
exploring techniques such as stochastic optimization and more efficient implementations of group
convolutions. Furthermore, we plan to extend our method to more complex group structures and
explore its applications in other challenging scenarios, such as adapting models for different modalities
or handling noisy or incomplete data.
In conclusion, this work provides a significant advancement in model adaptation, enabling the efficient
and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider range of applications. Our results demonstrate
the importance of considering group symmetries during model adaptation and showcase the potential
of our approach for various domains. The ability to adapt large pretrained models while preserving
equivariance opens up exciting possibilities for leveraging the power of these models in a wider range
of applications, particularly those involving structured data and inherent symmetries.

P057.pdf,"A Collaborative Painting Experience:
Human-Machine Interaction on Canvas
Abstract
We introduce a novel approach to human-machine interaction, framed as a pictorial
game where artists and a computer collaborate in iterative creative rounds. The
computer uses machine learning to partially complete the artwork at each stage,
projecting its additions directly onto the canvas, which the artists are then able to
modify or incorporate. This process encourages creative exploration and provokes
questions about the growing relationship between humans and machines.
1
Introduction
The ongoing technological advancements are reshaping human-machine interaction, providing new
tools for artistic creation while simultaneously prompting contemplation on their effects on human
creativity.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated the creative abilities of neural networks,
producing aesthetically full paintings. However, in these instances, humans serve as either engineers
or curators. Our work introduces a new method of machine utilization, integrating it into the core of
human creative processes. While painting, this approach presents humans with different paths and
concepts for their artwork. This concept is approached through a unique interactive framework.
The artist duo Tina and Charly have previously investigated interaction through canvas art. To initiate
their creative work, they select a theme and depict it in dark colors on a white canvas. They then
start their game. At each round, using a vocabulary of strokes and symbols, Charly anticipates Tina’s
emotions and thoughts in red, before responding with green strokes on the painting. These rounds
continue until both artists reach an agreement on finishing the painting. The entire process unfolds in
silence, with the canvas serving as the sole medium of dialogue.
The purpose of our work is to introduce artificial intelligence as a third participant in Tina and
Charly’s dialogue. The AI initially captures a raw representation of the painting, then processes it to
partially complete the work in progress, which it projects back onto the canvas. The artists then have
the freedom to incorporate the machine’s suggestion in blue, a color that has not been assigned to
either player. The use of different colors allows for the analysis of each player’s contributions.
2
Methodology
The engineered system includes a camera and a projector connected to a computer on a support. At
each computer round, the system captures an image of the painting and analyzes it to extract the
canvas strokes. This pre-processing is made robust to changes in lighting, ensuring that the interaction
can be used seamlessly in any studio. These strokes then feed into a neural sketcher, which produces
new strokes to be added to the painting. Post-processing is used to project those additions back onto
the canvas.
The neural sketcher is a recurrent neural network, based on a recent improvement to the seminal work
of previous research. It is trained using a sequence of points and a channel encoding for stroke breaks.
The sketcher produces a similar series, which is then converted back into strokes on the original
.
painting. The network was trained using the QuickDraw data set, enabling it to create human-like
strokes. For integration with Tina and Charly’s style, the learning was refined using a sketch database
from previous paintings by the artists.
3
Discussion
The artists found the machine strokes to be surprising and suggestive of movements they would not
have made on their own. Some painters have previously expressed how unintended strokes can be
evocative. Our installation, where the machine projects completions without physically painting, and
the generative network capabilities, allows this to be explored. Furthermore, the ability to change
parameters, such as the learning data set, provides the artist with more control over their usage of the
machine.
Our interactive installation can be used by anyone and aims to raise awareness and initiate thought
about the interplay between humans and machines. This work highlights the need to make machines
human-friendly, while also acknowledging how technology changes human behaviors and routines.
Tina and Charly felt like they were interacting with a full-body system, which had been designed
to simulate human-like painting. They experienced the machine as sometimes restricting, hard to
understand, and sometimes magical. It infused new dimensions into the painting. The feeling that the
machine could be collaborative or limiting is an echo of the role of technologies in our daily lives.
From an outsider’s perspective, the machine changes their original painting style, both in the short
term artworks (as seen in Figure 2), and on their long-term body of work, inspiring their machine-free
paintings. Even though we have made the machine’s influence explicit with its blue contributions, the
interaction is not neutral.

This paper addresses the critical task of assisting users in navigating unfamiliar events for specific

to-Actions (Q2A) Model, which employs vision transformer (ViT) and BERT to extract visual and
textual features, respectively. Moreover, attention mechanisms are leveraged to anchor question-
relevant information in instructional videos. Another study proposes a two-stage Function-centric
approach, which segments both the script and video into function clips instead of sentences or
frames. Additionally, they substitute BERT with XL-Net for text encoding. Despite the advancements
achieved through these techniques, all of them adopt the unaligned pretrained encoders to extract
visual and textual features, leading to significant semantic gaps between modalities, thereby hindering
better results.
To alleviate the negative effects of modalities unalignment, in this paper, we leverage pretrained
video-text models to achieve instructional video-text alignment, facilitating a more robust grounding
of question-relevant knowledge for multi-step inference. We build the pipeline with four steps:
Instructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and
Multi-Step Inference. Specifically, we employ pretrained VideoCLIP for generating video-script
alignment features, which are beneficial to cross-modal grounding. Subsequently, we anchor the
question-relevant content in instructional videos by the combination of hard and soft grounding.
Afterwards, we leverage additive attention to adjust the weighting of the multimodal context to
emphasize the salient features. Finally, we employ GRU for performing multi-step inference. We
reduce the proportion of teacher forcing linearly to bridge the gap between training and inference,
which boosts the multi-step inference.

Problem Definition
In this section, we formulate the problem of AQTC.
Given an instructional video, which contains numerous frames and scripts, AI assistant extracts
relevant information from the video in accordance with the user˘2019s question q. Then, it deduces
the correct answer ai j based on the image U as perceived by the user, from the candidate answer set
Ansi = ai 1, ai 2, ..., ai n in i-th step. Following previous work, we segment the video into several clips
based on scripts. Each clip illustrates one specific function of the device in video. We concatenate
.
these clips to form the visual function sequence as [F v 2 , ..., F v 1 , F v m] and the textual function
sequence as [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m], where F v i comprises all frames of the i-th function˘2019s clip,
and F t i contains all script sentences of the i-th function˘2019s clip. To adapt AI assistant to the
user˘2019s view, following previous work, we mask the referenced button related to candidate answers
in user images U , denoted as bk.

Method
In this section, we will introduce the details of our method. Our method consists of four steps:
Instructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and
Multi-Step Inference.
3.1
Instructional Video Alignment
To align the videos and the text for better cross-modal understanding, we leverage pretrained Video-
CLIP to generate the features of instructional videos. For the video part, we initially utilize pretrained
S3D to generate an embedding for each second of the video, with a frame rate of 30 frames per second.
Next, to represent each function within the videos, we utilize the pretrained visual transformer from
VideoCLIP to process the embeddings generated by S3D in each function. Then, we apply average
pooling over the processed sequence of embeddings to form the video embedding Vi corresponding
to a given visual function F v i . For the text part, we use the pretrained textual transformer of
VideoCLIP to encode the scripts of a textual function F t i . Similarly, we employ average pooling to
aggregate the processed sequence of text, generating the text embedding Ti of a given textual function
F t i . Finally, we obtain the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence
[T1, T2, ..., Tm] of the given function sequence.
Besides, we also utilize VideoCLIP to encode the questions q, the answer ai j and the masked button
image bk. We duplicate the images 30 times to ensure consistent video encoding. We get the question
feature Q, answer feature Ai j and visual button feature Bk.
3.2
Question-Aware Grounding
Owing to the extensive pretraining of VideoCLIP on a vast collection of videos, the features of videos
and text are cross-modal aligned. Therefore, we can utilize the question Q to ground the video and
text feature sequence directly. Specifically, we leverage three grounding mechanisms: soft, hard and
combined grounding. Soft grounding employs attention to learn the similarity between the question
feature Q and the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] directly. And, it uses another attention
network to compute the similarity between the question feature Q and the text feature sequence [T1,
T2, ..., Tm]. Soft grounding adopts the similarity from two attention networks to perform a weighted
average of the two feature sequences, respectively. Instead of relying on deep learning methods, hard
grounding follows previous work, which uses TF-IDF model to calculate the similarity between the
question q and each textual function F t i from textual function sequence [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m].
Then, it uses the similarities as the weights to compute the averages of the video feature sequence
[V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence [T1, T2, ..., Tm], respectively. Besides, the combined
grounding utilizes soft grounding and hard grounding simultaneously. Then, the two features from
two grounding methods are averaged. Ultimately, we obtain the aggregated question-aware video
feature V and text feature T .
3.3
Multimodal Context Reweighting
After obtaining multimodal question-aware context features from instructional videos, we need to
model the answers to determine the correct one. Specifically, we utilize the gate network to fuse
the candidate answer feature Ai j with the corresponding button feature Bk, which generates the
multimodal answer feature ˘02c6Ai j. We concatenate these multimodal contexts into a sequence [V,
T, Q, ˘02c6Ai j] for each candidate answer. Due to the varying importance of different context features
in determining the correct answers, we utilize additive attention to reweight the multimodal context
and get the fused feature. Finally, the fused feature is processed using a two-layer MLP to obtain the
candidate answer context feature C i j.
2
3.4
Multi-Step Inference
Owing to the requirement for multi-step guidance in order to respond to the given questions, it is
essential for models to perform multi-step inference. Following previous work, we utilize GRU to
infer the current correct answer by incorporating historical knowledge. Specifically, we feed the
previous hidden state H i˘22121 and the contextual features C i j of candidate answers in Ansi into
the GRU. Then, the resulting current hidden state H i j for each candidate answer in Ansi is utilized
to predict the correct answer in the i-th step. We adopt a two-layer MLP and the softmax function
on the concatenated current hidden states [H i 1, H i 2, ..., H i n] to generate the probability of the
correct answer. Cross entropy is used to compute the loss. While previous works utilize the state of
the ground truth as the historical state of the next step H i. This causes a huge gap between training
and inference. To bridge this gap, we reduce the reliance on teacher forcing linearly. In other words,
we choose the hidden state of the most probable answer predicted by models as the historical state of
the next step H i, when a sample is selected for autoregressive training.

the maximum training epoch is 100, and we adopt early stopping. We randomly select 5
4.2
Performance Evaluation
We present the performance evaluation on the test dataset in Table 1a. We find that our method
outperforms baseline methods. This superiority can be attributed to our utilization of a video-text
aligned pretrained encoder for feature extraction. The aligned features are beneficial to multi-step
inference. Furthermore, our method exhibits improved performance when the results are ensembled.

study, which adopts ViT for processing the visual features and XL-Net for processing the text features.
As shown in Table 1b, we observe that the performance of method that uses the unaligned features
drops sharply.

grounding techniques to train this model. The result is presented in Table 2. We find that the model
achieves optimal performance when the text grounding leverages combined grounding and the video
grounding utilizes soft grounding.

Reweighting Mechanism We show the result of the model without attention reweighting in Table 3a.
We observe a considerable decrease in performance for the model lacking attention reweighting. This
is because the attention reweighting can discern and prioritize the most informative features within
complex multimodal contexts.
Multi-Step Inference We evaluate different multi-step inference strategies, as demonstrated in Table
3b. We find that the performance of TeacherForcing is inferior to that of the Linear Decay strategy,
which is employed by our approach. This is because TeacherForcing widens the gap between training
and inference. We also observe that Linear Decay outperforms AutoRegression. This is because
teacher forcing is beneficial in preventing models from accumulating mistakes during the early stages
of training.
SSL The performance of the w/o SSL model exhibits a significant drop, as shown in Table 3a.

Conclusion
In this paper, we present a solution aimed at enhancing video alignment to achieve more effective
multi-step inference for the AQTC challenge. We leverage VideoCLIP to generate alignment features
between videos and scripts. Subsequently, we identify and highlight question-relevant content
within instructional videos. To further improve the overall context, we assign weights to emphasize
prominent features. Lastly, we employ GRU for conducting multi-step inference. Besides, we conduct
exhaustive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract
The notion of flamboyant jellyfish dancing on the moon precipitates an examination
of entropy, which somehow relates to the flavor of chocolate cake on Wednesdays,
and the propensity of cats to sleep for 17 hours a day, while simultaneously
contemplating the aerodynamics of umbrellas in a hurricane, all of which converges
to reveal a fascinating paradox, that the entropy of a system is directly proportional
to the number of rubber chickens present, and the color blue, which is only visible
on Tuesdays during leap years, has a profound impact on the spatial arrangement

consumption of pineapple pizza on Fridays leads to a decrease in entropy, while the
act of watching paint dry increases it, and the square root of -1 has a peculiar effect
on the second law of thermodynamics, which can only be understood by studying
the migration patterns of narwhals, and the entropy of a closed system is inversely
proportional to the number of socks lost in the wash, which is a fundamental concept
that has been overlooked by traditional theories of entropy, and the whispers of
ancient trees hold the secrets of the universe, including the true nature of entropy.
The curious case of disappearing socks in the laundry is a manifestation of the
entropy of the universe, and the flapping of butterfly wings in Brazil has a direct
impact on the entropy of a cup of coffee, which is somehow connected to the
meaning of life, and the number 42 has a profound significance in the context of
entropy, which can only be understood by deciphering the hidden codes in the
patterns of crop circles, and the entropy of a system is directly proportional to
the number of times the word ""entropy"" is mentioned in a sentence, which is a
phenomenon that has been observed in various studies of entropy. The intricate
dance of subatomic particles is a reflection of the entropy of the universe, and the
entropy of a closed system is directly proportional to the number of words in a
sentence, which is a fundamental concept that has been overlooked by traditional
theories of entropy, and the study of entropy is a complex and multifaceted field that
requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles, including the concept
of ""flumplenooks"" and the ""trans-dimensional wobble"" of particles in a vacuum.

The concept of entropy has been extensively studied in various fields, including the art of baking
croissants, where the flaky layers of dough are believed to exhibit a high degree of entropy due to
the random arrangement of butter and pastry. This phenomenon is closely related to the study of
linguistics, particularly in the analysis of the grammatical structure of ancient Sumerian texts, which
has been shown to possess a unique entropy signature that can be used to identify the authorship of
various tablets. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that the entropy of a system can be directly
correlated to the number of jellybeans in a jar, with a higher entropy corresponding to a greater
number of jellybeans.

Methodology
The investigation of entropy necessitates a comprehensive understanding of interdimensional jellyfish
migration patterns, which, in turn, are influenced by the subtle vibrations of extraterrestrial harmonicas.
To facilitate this endeavor, our research team embarked on an exhaustive examination of pastry dough,
specifically the croissant, and its inherent propensity for complexity. This exercise in culinary analysis
revealed intriguing parallels between the flaky, layered structure of croissants and the probabilistic
nature of thermodynamic systems.
Furthermore, the incorporation of rhizomatic theory and its application to the study of fungal networks
allowed us to better grasp the intricacies of entropy’s role in shaping the topology of interconnected
systems. By administering a standardized questionnaire to a cohort of professional snail trainers, we
were able to gather valuable insights into the human perception of entropy and its relationship to the
5
velocity of garden pests. Surprisingly, our findings indicated a statistically significant correlation
between the ability to discern subtle variations in lettuce crispiness and an individual’s innate

Experiments
The perpetual oscillations of quantum fluctuations necessitated an examination of the interplay be-
tween entropy and the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies, which, in turn, led to an investigation
of the aerodynamic properties of croissants. As we delved deeper into the complexities of this
phenomenon, we found ourselves pondering the societal implications of a world where spoons were
the dominant form of currency, and the ensuing trade agreements between fictitious nations would
inevitably collapse under the weight of their own bureaucratic flummery. Meanwhile, the entropy of
a system, much like the plot of a Dickens novel, continued to evolve in a state of constant flux, as if
the very fabric of reality was being woven and unwoven by an invisible loom.
In an effort to quantify this ephemeral dance of entropy, we conducted a series of experiments
involving the sonification of refrigerator hums, the cartography of forgotten memories, and the
spectroscopic analysis of the color blue. Our research team spent countless hours calibrating the
instruments, only to discover that the most crucial variable was, in fact, the proximity of the laboratory
to a nearby bakery, whose daily production of sourdough bread seemed to exert a profound influence
on the experimental outcomes. This led us to formulate the theory of ""crust-based entropy,"" which
posits that the crustiness of a bread loaf is directly proportional to the entropy of the surrounding
environment.
As we navigated the labyrinthine corridors of our research facility, we stumbled upon an obscure
manuscript detailing the art of ""extreme ironing,"" a practice that involves ironing clothes in extreme
or remote locations. The manuscript, penned by a mysterious figure known only as ""The Ironing
Guru,"" revealed a profound connection between the thermal dynamics of ironing and the second law
of thermodynamics. This epiphany prompted us to redesign our experimental apparatus to incorporate
a steam-powered ironing system, which, in turn, enabled us to measure the entropy of a system with
unprecedented precision.
The results of our experiments were nothing short of astonishing, as we observed a statistically
significant correlation between the entropy of a system and the average airspeed velocity of an unladen
swallow. Furthermore, our data suggested that the entropy of a system is inversely proportional to
the number of Rubber Chicken Units (RCUs) present in the surrounding environment. To better
understand this phenomenon, we constructed a table to illustrate the relationship between RCUs and
entropy:

Our research team spent several weeks pondering the implications of this discovery, during which
time we became embroiled in a heated debate about the merits of various types of cheese. The debate,
which began as a discussion of the thermodynamic properties of cheddar, eventually devolved into a
fracas involving a malfunctioning cheese dispenser and a can of compressed air. In the aftermath
of this incident, we realized that the true significance of our research lay not in the discovery of a
new law of physics, but in the development of a novel method for dispensing cheese in a laboratory
setting.
As we reflected on the trajectory of our research, we began to appreciate the intricate web of
connections that binds the universe together. We saw that the entropy of a system is not just a measure
of disorder or randomness, but a thread that weaves together the fabric of reality, connecting the
8
sonification of refrigerator hums to the cartography of forgotten memories, and the spectroscopic
analysis of the color blue to the art of extreme ironing. And so, our research came full circle, as
we returned to the humble beginnings of our inquiry, armed with a newfound appreciation for the
complexities and absurdities of the universe.
The introduction of a new variable, which we termed ""Flumplenook’s Constant,"" allowed us to refine
our model and make more accurate predictions about the behavior of complex systems. However,
this newfound understanding was short-lived, as we soon discovered that Flumplenook’s Constant
was, in fact, a function of the number of jellybeans in a nearby jar. This realization led us down a
rabbit hole of jellybean-themed research, which, in turn, prompted us to reexamine the fundamental
principles of our experiment.
In a bold move, we decided to replace the jellybeans with a similar quantity of ping-pong balls,
which, surprisingly, had a profound impact on the entropy of the system. The ping-pong balls, it
seemed, were exerting a hitherto unknown influence on the surrounding environment, causing the
entropy to fluctuate in a manner that defied explanation. Undeterred, we pressed on, driven by a fierce
determination to unravel the mysteries of the universe, no matter how absurd or illogical they may
seem.
As the experiment continued to evolve, we found ourselves confronting a myriad of unforeseen
challenges, from the great ""Sock Puppet Uprising"" of 2023 to the ""Mysterious Case of the Missing
Donuts."" Through it all, we persevered, driven by a steadfast commitment to the scientific method and
a healthy dose of skepticism. And so, our research journey continued, a winding path of discovery
that wound its way through the labyrinthine corridors of the human experience, guided by the faint
glow of curiosity and the unwavering dedication to the pursuit of knowledge.
The discovery of a hidden pattern in the data, which we termed the ""Flargle Effect,"" led us to
reexamine our assumptions about the nature of entropy. The Flargle Effect, it seemed, was a
manifestation of a deeper, more fundamental principle that governed the behavior of complex systems.
As we delved deeper into the mysteries of the Flargle Effect, we began to appreciate the intricate web
of connections that binds the universe together, a web that weaves together the threads of entropy,
quantum mechanics, and the sonification of refrigerator hums.
In a stunning breakthrough, we discovered that the Flargle Effect was, in fact, a function of the
number of trombones in a nearby orchestra. This realization led us to reexamine the role of music in
the universe, and the ways in which it influences the behavior of complex systems. The trombone,
it seemed, was more than just a musical instrument – it was a key to unlocking the secrets of the
universe.
As we continued to explore the mysteries of the Flargle Effect, we encountered a series of bizarre
and fantastical creatures, each with their own unique properties and characteristics. There was the
""Snurflotzer,"" a creature that existed in a state of quantum superposition, simultaneously being and
not being in a state of entropy. And the ""Glibblejibits,"" tiny, mischievous creatures that fed on the
entropy of complex systems, leaving behind a trail of order and organization.
Through our encounters with these creatures, we gained a deeper understanding of the nature of
entropy and the universe. We saw that entropy was not just a measure of disorder or randomness,
but a fundamental aspect of the human experience. It was a reminder that the universe is a complex,
multifaceted place, full of mysteries and wonders waiting to be discovered.
And so, our research journey came full circle, as we returned to the humble beginnings of our inquiry,
armed with a newfound appreciation for the complexities and absurdities of the universe. We had set
out to study the entropy of a system, but in the end, we had discovered something far more profound
– a deeper understanding of the human experience, and the intricate web of connections that binds the
universe together.
The implications of our research were far-reaching and profound, challenging our understanding of
the fundamental laws of physics and the nature of reality itself. As we looked out into the universe,
we saw a vast expanse of possibilities, a endless frontier of discovery and exploration. And we knew
that we had only just begun to scratch the surface of the mysteries that lay before us.
In the end, our research had taught us a valuable lesson – that the universe is a complex, multifaceted
place, full of mysteries and wonders waiting to be discovered. And that the pursuit of knowledge, no
matter how absurd or illogical it may seem, is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. As we
9
closed the door on our research, we couldn’t help but wonder what other secrets the universe held,
and what other wonders awaited us on the journey of discovery that lay ahead.
As the years went by, our research team continued to push the boundaries of human knowledge,
delving deeper into the mysteries of the universe. We encountered strange and fantastical creatures,
each with their own unique properties and characteristics. We discovered new forms of energy and
matter, and developed new technologies that allowed us to explore the universe in ways previously
unimaginable.
Through it all, we remained committed to the scientific method, and to the pursuit of knowledge for
its own sake. We knew that the universe was a complex, multifaceted place, full of mysteries and
wonders waiting to be discovered. And we were determined to explore every inch of it, no matter
how absurd or illogical the journey may seem.
In the end, our research had taught us a valuable lesson – that the universe is a vast and wondrous
place, full of mysteries and surprises waiting to be discovered. And that the pursuit of knowledge, no
matter how absurd or illogical it may seem, is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. As
we looked out into the universe, we knew that we had only just begun to scratch the surface of the
secrets that

Conclusion
In conclusion, the ramifications of entropy on the global cheese market have been far-reaching,
influencing not only the production of gouda, but also the migratory patterns of lesser-known avian
species, such as the quokka, which, incidentally, has been observed to have a penchant for 19th-
century French literature, particularly the works of Baudelaire, whose poetic musings on the human
condition have been likened to the intricacies of entropy itself, a concept that has been debated by
scholars of thermodynamics, who have posited that the second law of thermodynamics may be related
to the art of playing the harmonica, an instrument that has been known to induce a state of quantum
superposition in those who listen to its melodies, thereby increasing the entropy of the surrounding
environment, which, in turn, affects the local ecosystem, including the population dynamics of
insects, such as the butterfly, whose wings have been found to exhibit a fractal pattern, similar to
the arrangement of leaves on a stem, which has been studied by botanists, who have discovered
that the optimal arrangement of leaves is related to the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematical concept
12
that has been applied to various fields, including architecture, music, and even the design of roller
coasters, which, surprisingly, have been found to have a profound impact on the entropy of the human
brain, leading to a state of flux and disorder, characterized by a decrease in cognitive function and an
increase in the production of creative thoughts, which has been linked to the concept of negentropy, a
term coined by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger, who also made significant contributions to the field

ecologists, who have discovered that the shape and size of trees are influenced by a variety of factors,
including climate, soil quality, and the presence of symbiotic organisms, such as fungi, which have
been found to play a crucial role in the exchange of nutrients between trees, a process that has been
likened to the concept of entropy, whereby energy is transferred and transformed from one form to
another, often resulting in a decrease in organization and an increase in disorder, a phenomenon that
has been observed in a wide range of systems.
Furthermore, the study of entropy has been influenced by the field of economics, particularly the
concept of scarcity, which posits that the availability of resources is limited, leading to a state
of competition and disorder, similar to the concept of entropy, whereby energy is transferred and
transformed from one form to another, often resulting in a decrease in organization and an increase
in disorder, a phenomenon that has been observed in a wide range of systems, from the simplest
mechanical devices to the most complex biological organisms, including the human body, which has
been found to be subject to the laws of thermodynamics, including the second law, which states that
the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time, leading to a state of disorder

P010.pdf,"Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems:
Maximizing Sample Efficiency and Minimizing Variance
Abstract
Optimizing long-term user satisfaction in recommender systems, such as news feeds, is crucial during continuous
user-system interactions. Reinforcement learning has shown promise in addressing this challenge. However,
practical hurdles like low sample efficiency, potential risks, and high variance hinder the implementation of deep
reinforcement learning in online systems. We introduce a new reinforcement learning approach called model-based
counterfactual advantage learning (MBCAL) to tackle these challenges. MBCAL leverages the unique aspects of
recommender systems and incorporates concepts from model-based reinforcement learning to enhance sample
efficiency. It consists of two main parts: an environment model that predicts immediate user behavior sequentially
and a future advantage model that forecasts future utility. Counterfactual comparisons from the environment model
are used to mitigate the excessive variance when training the future advantage model. Consequently, MBCAL
achieves high sample efficiency and significantly reduced variance, while utilizing existing user logs to avoid
starting from scratch. Despite its capabilities, MBCAL maintains a relatively low implementation cost, making it
suitable for real-world systems. The proposed method surpasses other supervised learning and RL-based methods
in both sample efficiency and overall performance, as demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments.
1
Introduction
Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content and improving the efficiency of information retrieval.
Modern recommender systems, like news feeds, must consider multiple user-system interactions within a single session. The content
recommended in past interactions can influence future user behavior. For example, exploring new topics might pique a user’s interest
in related areas, while repeatedly showing similar content could lead to a rapid decline in user engagement. Traditional recommender
systems rely on collaborative filtering or neural networks to predict immediate user actions, such as clicks. However, solely focusing
on immediate actions can result in issues like recommendation redundancy, ultimately harming the user’s long-term experience.
Recently, deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has gained attention for its potential in recommender systems. Deep RL models
user-system interactions as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Many studies in this field focus on model-free reinforcement
learning (MFRL) methods. However, challenges persist, including the substantial data consumption during training, also known as
low sample efficiency. Another challenge is the practical risks associated with implementing MFRL. On-policy RL struggles to
utilize off-policy user logs, leading to difficulties in online infrastructure and initial performance. Conversely, off-policy RL faces
the risk of non-convergence when combined with function approximation and offline training.
Model-based RL (MBRL) offers an alternative with improved sample efficiency and reduced practical risks. MBRL employs
an environment model to predict immediate feedback and state transitions, along with a planning module to find an optimal
trajectory. However, MBRL can be computationally intensive during inference. Planning is often infeasible in multi-stage retrieval
frameworks commonly used in modern recommender systems. These systems generate candidate sets of items in earlier stages for
subsequent stages, making it impossible to predetermine candidates. To address these issues, Dyna algorithms have been proposed
for recommender systems. The Dyna algorithm accelerates convergence by generating virtual interactions using the environment
model. However, this faster convergence comes at the cost of reduced asymptotic performance due to error accumulation from
virtual interactions.
Another significant challenge in deploying RL is the excessive variance of gradients during optimization. This variance can stem
from stochastic transitions, noisy rewards, and stochastic policies. Longer horizons tend to exacerbate the variance, significantly
slowing down convergence and introducing instability. Prior research has shown that using an advantage function instead of a value
function can reduce variance and improve performance. However, these proposals primarily target MFRL, and variance reduction in
MBRL remains largely unexplored.
In recommender systems, variance can arise from various factors. First, there is substantial noise in observed user feedback. Some
users may be more inclined to provide positive or negative feedback than others. Even individual users may exhibit different
behaviors at different times of the day. Second, for stochastic policies, resampling trajectories from any state can lead to varying
long-term returns. While a large amount of data can mitigate the impact of variance, it still negatively affects performance due to
data sparsity for specific users and items.
To address variance reduction, our work introduces the concept of comparing an observed trajectory with a counterfactual trajectory.
This counterfactual trajectory shares all contexts with the original, including the user, historical interactions, and follow-up items,
except for the current action being replaced. By comparing these trajectories, we can make more informed judgments about the
advantage of taking a specific action. While finding such counterfactual records in user logs is impossible, we can leverage the
environment model to simulate future rollouts and generate these trajectories.
Building on this idea, we propose a novel MBRL solution for recommender systems called Model-based Counterfactual Advantage
Learning (MBCAL). MBCAL decomposes overall utility into immediate utility (rewards from the current step) and future utility
(rewards from future steps). The environment model naturally predicts immediate utility, while future utility is approximated through
simulated rollout. To further reduce variance in future utilities, we perform two comparative simulated rollouts. We introduce a
masking item to the environment model, enabling us to generate simulated rollouts by masking the action of interest. We then
calculate the counterfactual future advantage (CFA) as the difference in future utility with and without masking. Finally, we introduce
the future advantage model to approximate the CFA.
We conducted experiments using three real-world datasets and compared our method with supervised learning, MFRL, and MBRL
approaches. We also focused on Batch-RL and Growing Batch-RL settings, which are more aligned with practical infrastructures.
The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.
2
Methodology
The core concept of MBCAL is illustrated by employing two models: the Masked Environment Model (MEM) and the Future
Advantage Model (FAM). These models are designed to estimate immediate user behavior and future advantages, respectively. The
training process begins with optimizing the environment model to predict user behaviors, incorporating a masking item into the
model. Using the MEM, we compute the Counterfactual Future Advantage (CFA) by contrasting the future utility derived from
masking the action against not masking it. The CFA then serves as the target for training the FAM. During inference, we combine
both models to select actions.
We first formalize the environment model and then detail the MEM, FAM, and the overall learning process. Following this, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method.
2.1
Environment Modeling
Typically, an environment model predicts transitions and rewards separately. Here, we use approximations for the transition
probability and the reward function. Specifically, to formulate the environment model in a recommender system context, we can
express the transition probability as the probability of observing the next user behavior given the past trajectory and the current
action. This means that predicting the transition simplifies to predicting the immediate user behavior. Since the reward also depends
solely on user behavior, a single model can replace the separate transition and reward approximations. We introduce a function with
trainable parameters to approximate the probability of the next user behavior. The transition and reward are then approximated using
this function.
2.2
Masked Environment Model
To mitigate the intractable noise in user feedback, we introduce a masking item into the model. This allows us to create a
counterfactual comparison to the current trajectory, answering the question: ""What would the future behavior be if this action were
not taken?"" We introduce a virtual item represented by a trainable embedding vector. Given an observation trajectory, we denote the
trajectory where actions at specific positions are replaced by this virtual item as a masked trajectory.
Training is straightforward. We sample random positions for each trajectory, replacing each position with a uniform probability. The
MEM aims to recover the user behavior as closely as possible when some items are masked. Using the collected masked trajectories,
we maximize the likelihood or minimize the negative log-likelihood (NLL).
To model sequential observations, the MEM’s architecture follows that of session-based recurrent recommender systems. We use a
Gated Neural Network to encode the trajectory. Since we need to encode both the trajectory and the current action, we concatenate
the input in a staggered manner. For each step, the model takes the previous behavior and the current action as input and outputs the
probability of the next possible behavior. An additional start symbol is introduced as the beginning of the observed user behavior.
The architecture is formulated as follows: a representation layer, a concatenation operation, a multilayer perceptron, and a Gated
Recurrent Unit.
2
2.3
Counterfactual Future Advantage
Using the Masked Environment Model (MEM), we can estimate the difference in future utilities between the original trajectory and
its counterfactual counterpart, which we term the Counterfactual Future Advantage (CFA). Given a trained MEM, we first define the
Simulated Future Reward (SFR) for an observed trajectory at a specific time step. We then calculate the CFA by subtracting the SFR
of the counterfactual comparison from the original one. Finally, we introduce the Future Advantage Model (FAM), with its own set
of trainable parameters, to approximate this CFA. To train the FAM, we minimize the mean square error.
The FAM uses a similar neural architecture to the MEM, except for the final layer, but with different parameters. Instead of predicting
a distribution, the FAM’s last layer predicts a scalar value representing the advantage.
2.4
Summary of MBCAL
For inference, we select the item (action) based on both the MEM and FAM. Formally, given user information and the observation
trajectory, we choose the next action by maximizing the sum of the immediate reward predicted by the MEM and the future advantage
predicted by the FAM. To avoid local optima in policy improvement, we use an ε-greedy strategy. With probability ε, we select a
random action; otherwise, we select the action that maximizes the combined reward and advantage.
MBCAL aligns well with the Growing Batch-RL settings. The algorithm involves iterative data collection and policy updates.
Although we use the term ""policy,"" we do not require an explicit policy formulation, unlike common policy gradient methods, which
are often challenging to define in many recommender systems.
The variance reduction in MBCAL is primarily achieved through the subtraction in the CFA calculation, which eliminates noise
from user feedback and other sources. While we borrow ideas from the advantage function concept, our CFA differs in that we do
not resample the trajectory but keep the remaining part unchanged. Although this could introduce bias in many MDP problems, we
argue that recommender systems exhibit weaker correlations between sequential decisions compared to other domains (e.g., robot or
game control). Additionally, since the FAM averages the CFA across different trajectories, the bias becomes negligible compared to
the benefits of variance reduction.

Experiments
3.1
Datasets
Evaluating RL-based recommender systems is challenging. The most reliable metric involves online A/B tests, but these are often
too costly and risky for comparing all baselines in an online system. Offline evaluation of long-term utility using user logs is difficult
because we lack feedback for actions not present in the log. To thoroughly assess the performance of the proposed systems, we
follow previous works and construct simulators. However, instead of synthetic simulators, we use real-data-driven simulators. The
datasets used include MovieLens, Netflix Prize, and NewsFeed.
• MovieLens: This dataset contains 5-star rating activities from MovieLens. User behavior corresponds to star ratings, with
rewards matching these ratings. There are three types of features: movie-id, movie-genre, and movie-tag.
• Netflix Prize: This dataset consists of 5-star ratings from Netflix. Rewards follow the same setup as MovieLens. It includes
only one type of feature: movie-id.
• NewsFeed: This dataset is collected from a real online news recommendation system. We focus on predicting the dwelling
time on clicked news, partitioned into 12 levels, each corresponding to a different user behavior. Rewards range from
1 to 12. There are seven types of features: news-id, news-tag, news-title, news-category, news-topics, news-type, and
news-source.
3.2
Experimental Settings
To ensure a fair evaluation, it is crucial to prevent the agent in the evaluated system from exploiting the simulator. We implement
two specific settings in the evaluation process. First, all agents are restricted to using only a subset of features, while the simulator
uses the full feature set. In MovieLens and Netflix, agents use only the movie-id feature. In NewsFeed, agents use four out of seven
features (news-id, category, news-type, and news-source). Second, we intentionally set the model architecture of the simulator to
differ from that of the agents. We use LSTM units for the simulators, while agents use GRU units.
To gauge the simulator’s accuracy, we report micro-F1, weighted-F1, and RMSE for user behavior classification. The properties of
the datasets and simulators are detailed in Table 2. For the NewsFeed dataset, we also analyzed over 400 historical A-B test records.
The correlation between our simulator’s predictions of long-term rewards (e.g., total clicks or session dwelling time) and the actual
outcomes is above 0.90.
3
3.2.1
Evaluation Settings
The evaluation process consists of two types of iterations: training rounds and test rounds. During a training round, the agent
generates actions using an ε-greedy policy (ε = 0.1 for all experiments) and updates its policy based on feedback from the simulator.
In the test round, the agent uses a greedy policy, and the generated data is not used for training. Each session in both training and test
rounds involves 20 steps of interaction between the simulator and the agent. Each round includes 256,000 sessions.
For each experiment, we report the average reward per session in the test round, calculated as the sum of rewards over all sessions in
the test round divided by the number of sessions. Each experiment is repeated three times with different random seeds, and we
report the mean and variance of the scores. We simulate both Batch RL and Growing Batch-RL evaluations separately. In Batch RL
evaluation, the agent trains only on static user logs and interacts with the simulator during testing. In Growing Batch RL evaluation,
the agent interacts with the simulator during both training and test rounds, with the training round repeating up to 40 times.
3.3
Methods for Comparison
We compare various methods, including Supervised Learning (GRU4Rec), bandits (GRU4Rec (ε-greedy)), MFRL (MCPE, DQN,
DDQN, and DDPG), and MBRL (Dyna-Q). For bandits, LinUCB is a common baseline, but it performs poorly in our environments
due to the limited representational power of linear models. Therefore, we use the ε-greedy version of NN models (GRU4Rec
(ε-greedy)) instead of LinUCB.
The methods for comparison are:
• GRU4Rec: Uses GRU to encode interactive history to predict immediate user behavior, with an architecture equivalent to
the environment model. We use entropy loss in GRU4Rec.
• GRU4Rec (ε-greedy): Applies ε-greedy item selection in GRU4Rec during training rounds.
• DQN: A classic off-policy learning algorithm. We use GRU for state representation to ensure fair comparison, similar to
GRU4Rec and our method.
• DDQN: Double DQN, which uses a different action selection for value backup to avoid value overestimation in off-policy
learning. The model architecture is equivalent to GRU4Rec.
• DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, an off-policy learning algorithm for continuous action spaces. The inferred
action selects the nearest neighbor item for display. We use the same neural structure as GRU4Rec for both actor and critic
networks.
• MCPE: Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation, a straightforward value iteration algorithm using the whole trajectory for value
backup. The model architecture is the same as other baselines.
• Dyna-Q: An MBRL method that augments DQN with imagined rollouts from an environment model. The ratio of imagined
rollouts to real trajectories is 1:1.
• MBCAL: The full version of our proposed method.
• MBCAL (w/o variance reduction): An ablated version of MBCAL where we use SFR instead of CFA as the label for FAM.
All parameters are optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10-3, β1 = 0.9, and β2 = 0.999. The discount factor for
long-term rewards is γ = 0.95. Embedding sizes for item-id and other id-type features are set to 32. The hidden size for MLP is 32.
For training MEM in MBCAL, we use pmask = 0.20 to generate masked trajectories. In DDPG, we use a 4-dimensional action space
due to poor performance with higher dimensions, and an additional layer maps item representations to this 4-dimensional space.
3.4
Experimental Results
3.4.1
Results of Batch-RL Evaluation
The results of the Batch-RL evaluation are presented in Table 3. We evaluate the reward per session based on the rewards generated
by the simulator. The results indicate that MFRL methods cannot outperform MBRL methods across all three environments. Due to
its sample inefficiency, MFRL tends to exhibit poor initial performance. Notably, DDPG demonstrates the weakest performance
across all environments. Upon closer examination of the value functions in DDPG, we observed significant overestimation compared
to other MFRL methods. This overestimation likely arises from value backups based on continuous actions that may not correspond
to actual items.
As anticipated, MBCAL outperforms all other tested systems by substantial margins, showcasing its sample efficiency. However, the
advantage of our method over the supervised learning method is less pronounced in the MovieLens and Netflix datasets compared to
NewsFeed. This suggests that long-term rewards play a more significant role in the NewsFeed environment.
Furthermore, while learning to predict long-term utility requires more data than immediate rewards, the dominance of RL is not
yet fully apparent in Batch-RL settings. Nevertheless, it is crucial that MBCAL’s initial performance is already state-of-the-art,
underscoring its low risk and high sample efficiency.

Results of Growing Batch-RL Evaluation
In all environments, GRU4Rec(ε-greedy) slightly outperforms the purely supervised GRU4Rec, highlighting the advantages of
exploration in online systems. The performance of DDPG remains surprisingly poor across all three environments.
With the aid of the environment model, Dyna-Q initially gains some advantages but gradually diminishes as learning progresses.
This observation aligns with expectations since the virtual experience loses its benefits as sufficient real user feedback accumulates.
MBCAL maintains its performance lead over other methods in all environments. Even in Netflix and MovieLens, where other
RL-based systems fail to outperform traditional GRU4Rec, MBCAL achieves a considerable margin. In NewsFeed, where long-term
rewards are more critical, MBCAL further extends its lead.
MCPE, DQN, DDQN, and Dyna-Q lag behind other methods, including supervised learning baselines in MovieLens and Netflix, but
not in NewsFeed. Investigating further, we modified GRU4Rec to output the immediate reward instead of user behavior classification,
turning the task into regression and replacing entropy loss with mean square error loss. This change resulted in a significant
performance drop in GRU4Rec, aligning more closely with the NewsFeed results. These findings suggest that classification and
entropy loss benefit the system more than regression, and that user behavior contains richer information than rewards, giving MBRL
an edge over MFRL.
3.4.3
Analysis of the variance
The critical aspect of MBCAL is variance reduction through counterfactual comparisons. Previous research indicates that the
mean square error (MSE) in a well-trained model comprises model bias and label variance (noise). Since we use equivalent neural
architectures across all comparison methods, they share the same model bias. Thus, the MSE is primarily influenced by noise. To
assess whether CFA effectively reduces variance, we compare the MSE from the value backup equation and the CFA equation. We
analyze the MSE of MCPE, DQN, Dyna-Q, MBCAL (w/o variance reduction), and MBCAL using interactive logs from the test
round of Batch-RL evaluation.

The average MSE is presented in Table 4. Consistent with theoretical analysis, longer horizon value backups exhibit higher variance.
MCPE has a higher variance than DQN and Dyna-Q due to using the entire trajectory for backup. MBCAL (w/o variance reduction)
has the second-largest variance, lower than MCPE because the environment model’s simulated rollout partially eliminates noise.
DQN and Dyna-Q have smaller variances due to one-step value backup. Compared to other methods, MBCAL shows significantly
lower variance, confirming the expected variance reduction.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our work focuses on sequential decision-making problems in recommender systems. To maximize long-term utility,
we propose a sample-efficient and variance-reduced reinforcement learning method called MBCAL. This method incorporates a
masked environment model to capture immediate user behavior and a future advantage model to predict future utility. By employing
counterfactual comparisons, MBCAL significantly reduces learning variance. Experiments conducted on real-data-driven simulations
demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses existing approaches in both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Future
work could involve theoretically calculating the error bound and extending the fixed horizon settings to infinite and dynamic horizon
recommender systems.

P114.pdf,"An Empathetic AI Painter: A System for
Computational Creativity Through Embodied
Conversational Interaction
Abstract
This paper presents an investigation into the computational modeling of the creative
process of a portrait artist, focusing on the incorporation of human traits like per-
sonality and emotions into the artistic process. The system includes an empathetic
conversational component to discern the dominant personality traits of the user,
and this information is then utilized by a generative AI portraiture module to create
a personalized stylization of the user’s portrait. The paper details the system and
the outcomes of real-time interactions from a demonstration session.
1
Introduction
The incorporation of human traits in the creation of artworks has consistently held significant
importance. Although there are differences between art and science regarding their goals and
toolsets, these distinctions blur when artists use scientific understanding to inform their work and
science examines art to comprehend the human experience. The idea of leveraging established
psychological insights into human traits such as personality and emotion to guide the creation,
critique, and informing of artwork is not novel. Traditional portrait artists employ their understanding
of human perception and vision to create portraits from life or photographs. This process includes the
arrangement of the environment, placement of the subject, and an interview to grasp their mental
and physical characteristics. Artists also aim to convey their individual painting style while trying
to express personal and universal ideas. An artist has several options in themes, brush style, color
plan, edge and line plan, abstraction style, and emotional narrative to achieve the finished artwork.
Computational creativity and generative art offer fresh avenues for modeling scientific knowledge
to replicate this process and deepen our grasp of human creativity. This study uses AI techniques
to begin emulating this artistic procedure. The Empathic AI Painter system seeks to discover novel
approaches to balance diverse aesthetic and conceptual aspects.
2
System Description
The Empathic Painter System is created to mimic the interaction between a live portrait artist and
a person, referred to as the sitter. It aims to understand the sitter’s traits, such as personality and
emotions, to create a unique portrait by selecting the appropriate abstraction techniques, color palette,
and style that correspond to those traits. The system operates in a two-stage process; the first stage
involves capturing the characteristics of the sitter, followed by the second stage, which uses the
captured traits to generate a stylized artistic representation of their portrait. The initial stage of
capturing the personality of the sitter occurs during the conversation with an embodied conversational
agent, using empathetic interaction methods. This system utilizes the M-Path conversational agent,
which has been developed previously. The M-Path system was modified for this demonstration to
conduct an interview based on the Big-5 personality questionnaire to categorize the sitter into one
of the established personality dimensions. This data is then used to map the personality traits to a
particular artistic style. The mapping is transferred to the Generative AI Portrait Stylization system in
.
the second stage, which creates an artistic portrait. The interaction process includes several steps.
First, a portrait of the sitter is captured under controlled lighting conditions, and a unique ID is
assigned after consent is provided for participation and use of the portrait. The sitter is then given
information about the M-Path system with instructions about how to interact. The sitter initiates
the interaction until a complete conversation is concluded and the agent informs the sitter that the
interaction has ended. The M-Path system uses the data collected to classify the sitter’s personality
into a specific dimension. This dimension is then used by the Generative AI Portraiture system
to create a personalized portrait style. The generated portraits are showcased on a monitor for all
participants and the crowd to observe and assess.
2.1
Big-5 Personality Mapping
The five-factor model of personality is also known as the ""Big-5 Personality Model"" and is designed
as a categorization to capture the variations in personality traits among individuals. This model
classifies personality variations across five dimensions: extraversion, openness, conscientiousness,
neuroticism, and agreeableness. Each of these dimensions encompasses a wide range of psychological
functions, which are composed of more specific traits. Extraversion pertains to the extent to which
people are dominant, talkative, assertive, active, energetic and enthusiastic. Openness characterizes
people who are curious, creative, innovative, imaginative, reflective, cultured, curious, original,
broad-minded, intelligent, and artistically sensitive, seeking new experiences and exploring novel
ideas. Conscientiousness indicates an individual’s level of hard work, persistence, organization,
and motivation in achieving their goals. Individuals high in conscientiousness tend to be organized,
plan-oriented, and determined. Neuroticism, also referred to as Emotional Stability, represents
differences in emotional stability and adjustment. Individuals scoring high on neuroticism tend
to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, impulsiveness, self-consciousness,
vulnerability, anger, hostility and worry. Agreeableness is linked to likability, conformity, friendliness,
and social compliance. Individuals with high scores in agreeableness are characterized as trusting,
caring, forgiving, altruistic, flexible, gullible, good-natured, soft-hearted, cooperative and tolerant.
This model is based on factor analysis of descriptive words of human behavior. The questionnaire
used is a shortened version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, which has 120 questions
and takes 45 minutes to complete. For the online demonstration, one statement for each dimension
was used, where the whole conversational interaction could be completed in under 5 minutes. Each
question is further modified to align with the conversation setup in the demonstration environment.
Dimension
Question
Openness
How do you like the conference so far, is it interesting to you?
Conscientiousness
Don’t you think the conferences are always a bit chaotic?
Extraversion
Do you normally talk and interact with a lot of people?
Agreeableness
How about agents? Do you trust me in sharing how you feel?
Neuroticism
How do you feel about your portrait being displayed on the screen?
Table 1: The questions used for the personality dimensions.
The answers to these questions are evaluated for their polarity and then mapped onto two-factor
dimensions for personality adjectives. The mapping model is the Abridged Big Five Circumplex
Model, in which facets of the Big Five dimensions are mapped as combinations of two factors. The
AB5C mapping contains descriptive personality terms for each of the resulting 90 combinations,
where the most distinctive trait of an individual is used to select the column, and the second most
distinctive trait selects the row. These traits may be either negative or positive. The mapping from
Big-5 traits to the Generative AI portrait styles was provided by art experts who independently
mapped the styles to the Big-5 categories and reached an agreement.
2.2
Empathic Conversational Avatar
The starting point of interaction is the empathetic conversational agent, M-Path, which was developed
using a framework based on a computational model of empathy. M-Path is a human-like avatar
capable of initiating and maintaining an emotional conversation, based on the predetermined goal of
the dialogue. The interaction involves a face-to-face conversation with a human interaction partner,
2
similar to a video-conference with audio and visual input and output. The agent processes the
real-time inputs in terms of their linguistic and affective properties to generate empathetic verbal
and non-verbal behavior. The main objective of the interaction is to complete the modified Big-5
questionnaire to categorize the partner’s personality and send it to the generative art system. The
system has three distinct modules: a perceptual module, a behavior controller and a behavior manager.
The perceptual module gathers the video and audio signals when the conversation partner is speaking.
This process was triggered with a push-to-talk system. M-Path enters a listening state when the
user speaks. During the listening state, speech and facial expressions are processed in real-time for
speech and emotion recognition. The video input is used in the facial emotion recognition module,
which uses an OpenCV face-recognition algorithm to identify the face. Emotions are categorized
using a CNN model, trained on the CK+ Dataset, into 6 basic emotion categories. The speech
input is sent to the speech-to-text module which uses a service to get streaming speech recognition.
Sentiment analysis evaluates the text for its polarity using the SO-CAL Sentiment Analyzer, which
was trained on the NRC-Canada lexicon. The text is sent to the decision-making module for creating
conversational responses. This process continues until the partner finishes speaking, which concludes
the listening state. The information is then sent to the decision-making module, and the agent enters a
thinking state. The behavior controller module creates goal-directed verbal and non-verbal responses
in all states of the conversation: listening, thinking, and speaking. This is done by analyzing the user’s
emotional response from the listening state. The conversation begins with the user’s greeting and
finishes when the agent receives suitable answers to the personality survey questions. The listening,
thinking, and speaking states of the agent loop until the user is categorized. During the listening
stage, the agent shows a non-verbal affect matching response and backchanneling behavior. Affect
matching is a facial expression that mirrors the user’s facial expressions in real-time, chosen by
empathy mechanisms. Backchanneling is created by a nodding behavior when pauses are detected
in the user’s speech. These behaviors are combined to create an empathic listening behavior. After
the conversation with the participant ends, the final text received and the user’s overall sentiment are
sent to the Dialogue Manager (DM), and ultimately to the Empathy Mechanisms (EM). The DM
completes the Big-5 personality questionnaire to assign a personality category. The EM ensures that
the DM generates empathetic responses while reaching its goal. The DM gathers the appropriate
emotional response from the EM to generate an emotionally appropriate verbal reaction to the user,
followed by a survey-related coping response, and then the next survey question. The system uses the
scikit-learn library in Python for the TF-IDF vectorizer model, and the NLTK Lemmatizer. A second
model is created by fine-tuning BERT for the classification of user responses according to sentiment
and the Big-5 questionnaire answers. The Big-5 questionnaire answers are collected to select the
most dominant personality dimensions of the user, based on their probability values and polarity. The
Big-5 mapping is used to select a category for the user, with adjectives. This categorization is then
sent to the generative art cycle to produce a personalized portrait. After each response is generated
by the dialogue manager, it is sent to the behavior manager to be performed by the conversational
agent during the speaking state. To achieve a natural conversation, the system continuously produces
non-verbal and verbal behaviors. Lip movements, facial expressions, head gestures, body gestures,
and posture are synchronized with the agent’s speech. The animation is sent as a BML message to
the Smartbody character animation platform, to display the generated behaviors.

Generative AI Portraiture System
The stylistic rendering of the portraits is generated by the generative art component of the system.
The portrait goes through three processing phases. The first phase preprocesses the original portrait
by using an AI tool to separate the foreground from the background, which will be used to stylize
the portrait. Then, the light and color balance of the face are adjusted to achieve a lighting effect,
where one side of the face is dramatically shown. The next phase uses this image and the personality
category as inputs to a modified Deep Dream (mDD) system with multiple passes on the image to
create the base style. While most DD systems use pre-trained networks with object recognition data,
the modified system uses artistic paintings and drawings as training data. The system has a dataset of
160,000 labeled and categorized paintings from 3000 artists. A method called hierarchical tight style
and tile was developed to overcome the problem that most artists create fewer than 200 paintings
in their lifetimes. In the last phase, the source image from the previous phase is further enhanced
using the personality category. The ePainterly system combines Deep Style techniques as a surface
texture manipulator, and a series of Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) techniques like particle
systems, color palette manipulation, and stroke engine techniques. This iterative process enhances
3
the portrait, and the final result is shown in an online gallery. The ePainterly module is an expansion
of the Painterly painting system, which models the cognitive processes of artists based on years of
research. The NPR subclass of stroke-based rendering is used as the final part of the process to realize
the internal mDD models with stroke-based output. This additional step reduces noise artifacts from
the mDD output, creates cohesive stroke-based clustering, and a better distributed color space.

Conclusion
The Empathic AI Painter was presented at a conference demonstration session. Forty-two participants
tested the system, with 26 of them completing the portrait-taking and interaction. Each conversation
with the M-Path system took approximately 5 minutes. The performance of the M-Path system was
evaluated individually. On average, 84.72

P050.pdf,"Interpreting Recurrent and Attention-Based Neural
Models: a Case Study on Natural Language Inference
Abstract
Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in natural language in-
ference (NLI) tasks. While these models are widely explored, they are hard to
interpret and it is often unclear how and why they actually work. we take a step
toward explaining such deep learning based models through a case study on a
popular neural model for NLI. we propose to interpret the intermediate layers
of NLI models by visualizing the saliency of attention and LSTM gating signals.
We present several examples for which our methods are able to reveal interesting
insights and identify the critical information contributing to the model decisions.
1
Introduction
Deep learning has achieved tremendous success for many NLP tasks. However, unlike traditional
methods that provide optimized weights for human understandable features, the behavior of deep
learning models is much harder to interpret. Due to the high dimensionality of word embeddings, and
the complex, typically recurrent architectures used for textual data, it is often unclear how and why a
deep learning model reaches its decisions.
There are a few attempts toward explaining/interpreting deep learning-based models, mostly by
visualizing the representation of words and/or hidden states, and their importances (via saliency or
erasure) on shallow tasks like sentiment analysis and POS tagging. we focus on interpreting the
gating and attention signals of the intermediate layers of deep models in the challenging task of
Natural Language Inference. A key concept in explaining deep models is saliency, which determines
what is critical for the final decision of a deep model. So far, saliency has only been used to illustrate
the impact of word embeddings. we extend this concept to the intermediate layer of deep models to
examine the saliency of attention as well as the LSTM gating signals to understand the behavior of
these components and their impact on the final decision.
We make two main contributions. First, we introduce new strategies for interpreting the behavior of
deep models in their intermediate layers, specifically, by examining the saliency of the attention and
the gating signals. Second, we provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art model for the NLI
task and show that our methods reveal interesting insights not available from traditional methods of
inspecting attention and word saliency.
our focus was on NLI, which is a fundamental NLP task that requires both understanding and
reasoning. Furthermore, the state-of- the-art NLI models employ complex neural architectures
involving key mechanisms, such as attention and repeated reading, widely seen in successful models
for other NLP tasks. As such, we expect our methods to be potentially useful for other natural
understanding tasks as well.
2
Task and Model
In NLI, we are given two sentences, a premise and a hypothesis, the goal is to decide the logical
relationship (Entailment, Neutral, or Contradiction) between them.
Many of the top performing NLI models, are variants of the ESIM model, which we choose to
analyze. ESIM reads the sentences independently using LSTM at first, and then applies attention to
align/contrast the sentences. Another round of LSTM reading then produces the final representations,
which are compared to make the prediction.
3
Visualization of Attention and Gating
we are primarily interested in the internal workings of the NLI model. we focus on the attention and
the gating signals of LSTM readers, and how they contribute to the decisions of the model.
3.1
Attention
Attention has been widely used in many NLP tasks and is probably one of the most critical parts
that affects the inference decisions. Several pieces of prior work in NLI have attempted to visualize
the attention layer to provide some understanding of their models. Such visualizations generate a
heatmap representing the similarity between the hidden states of the premise and the hypothesis.
Unfortunately the similarities are often the same regardless of the decision.
Let us consider the following example, where the same premise “A kid is playing in the garden”, is
paired with three different hypotheses:
h1: A kid is taking a nap in the garden
h2: A kid is having fun in the garden with her family
h3: A kid is having fun in the garden
Note that the ground truth relationships are Contradiction, Neutral, and Entailment, respectively.
The key issue is that the attention visualization only allows us to see how the model aligns the premise
with the hypothesis, but does not show how such alignment impacts the decision. This prompts us to
consider the saliency of attention.
3.1.1
Attention Saliency
The concept of saliency was first introduced in vision for visualizing the spatial support on an image
for a particular object class. In NLP, saliency has been used to study the importance of words toward
a final decision.
We propose to examine the saliency of attention. Specifically, given a premise-hypothesis pair and
the model’s decision y, we consider the similarity between a pair of premise and hypothesis hidden
states eij as a variable. The score of the decision S(y) is thus a function of eij for all i and j. The
saliency of eij is then defined to be |S(y) / eij|.
, the saliencies are clearly different across the examples, each highlighting different parts of the
alignment. Specifically, for h1, we see the alignment between “is playing” and “taking a nap” and the
alignment of “in a garden” to have the most prominent saliency toward the decision of Contradiction.
For h2, the alignment of “kid” and “her family” seems to be the most salient for the decision of
Neutral. Finally, for h3, the alignment between “is having fun” and “kid is playing” have the strongest
impact toward the decision of Entailment.
From this example, we can see that by inspecting the attention saliency, we effectively pinpoint which
part of the alignments contribute most critically to the final prediction whereas simply visualizing the
attention itself reveals little information.
3.1.2
Comparing Models
In the previous examples, we study the behavior of the same model on different inputs. Now we use
the attention saliency to compare the two different ESIM models: ESIM-50 and ESIM-300.
Consider two examples with a shared hypothesis of “A man ordered a book” and premise:
p1: John ordered a book from amazon
p2: Mary ordered a book from amazon
2
Here ESIM-50 fails to capture the gender connections of the two different names and predicts Neutral
for both inputs, whereas ESIM-300 correctly predicts Entailment for the first case and Contradiction
for the second.
Although the two models make different predictions, their attention maps appear qualitatively similar.
We see that for both examples, ESIM-50 primarily focused on the alignment of “ordered”, whereas
ESIM-300 focused more on the alignment of “John” and “Mary” with “man”. interesting to note that
ESIM-300 does not appear to learn significantly different similarity values compared to ESIM-50
for the two critical pairs of words (“John”, “man”) and (“Mary”, “man”) based on the attention map.
The saliency map, however, reveals that the two models use these values quite differently, with only
ESIM-300 correctly focusing on them. It is
3.2
LSTM Gating Signals
LSTM gating signals determine the flow of information. In other words, they indicate how LSTM
reads the word sequences and how the information from different parts is captured and combined.
LSTM gating signals are rarely analyzed, possibly due to their high dimensionality and complexity.
we consider both the gating signals and their saliency, which is computed as the partial derivative of
the score of the final decision with respect to each gating signal.
Instead of considering individual dimensions of the gating signals, we aggregate them to consider
their norm, both for the signal and for its saliency. Note that ESIM models have two LSTM layers,
the first (input) LSTM performs the input encoding and the second (inference) LSTM generates the
representation for inference.
, we first note that the saliency tends to be somewhat consistent across different gates within the same
LSTM, suggesting that we can interpret them jointly to identify parts of the sentence important for
the model’s prediction.
Comparing across examples, we see that the saliency curves show pronounced differences across the
examples. For instance, the saliency pattern of the Neutral example is significantly different from the
other two examples, and heavily concentrated toward the end of the sentence (“with her family”).
Note that without this part of the sentence, the relationship would have been Entailment. The focus
(evidenced by its strong saliency and strong gating signal) on this particular part, which presents
information not available from the premise, explains the model’s decision of Neutral.
Comparing the behavior of the input LSTM and the inference LSTM, we observe interesting shifts
of focus. the inference LSTM tends to see much more concentrated saliency over key parts of the
sentence, whereas the input LSTM sees more spread of saliency. For example, for the Contradiction
example, the input LSTM sees high saliency for both “taking” and “in”, whereas the inference LSTM
primarily focuses on “nap”, which is the key word suggesting a Contradiction. Note that ESIM uses
attention between the input and inference LSTM layers to align/contrast the sentences, hence it makes
sense that the inference LSTM is more focused on the critical differences between the sentences.
This is also observed for the Neutral example as well.
It is worth noting that, while revealing similar general trends, the backward LSTM can sometimes
focus on different parts of the sentence, suggesting the forward and backward readings provide
complementary understanding of the sentence.

Conclusion
We propose new visualization and interpretation strategies for neural models to understand how
and why they work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies on a complex task
(NLI). Our strategies are able to provide interesting insights not achievable by previous explanation
techniques. Our future work will extend our study to consider other NLP tasks and models with the
goal of producing useful insights for further improving these models.

Appendix
5.1
Model
In this section we describe the ESIM model. We divide ESIM to three main parts: 1) input encoding,
2) attention, and 3) inference.
Let u = [u1, · · · , un] and v = [v1, · · · , vm] be the given premise with length n and hypothesis with
length m respectively, where ui, vj Rr are word embeddings of r-dimensional vector. The goal is to
predict a label y that indicates the logical relationship between premise u and hypothesis v. Below we
briefly explain the aforementioned parts.
5.1.1
Input Encoding
It utilizes a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for encoding the given premise and hypothesis using
Equations 1 and 2 respectively.
(1) u^ = BiLSTM(u)
(2) v^ = BiLSTM(v)
where u^ Rn×2d and v^ Rm×2d are the reading sequences of u and v respectively.
5.1.2
Attention
It employs a soft alignment method to associate the relevant sub-components between the given
premise and hypothesis. Equation 3 (energy function) computes the unnormalized attention weights
as the similarity of hidden states of the premise and hypothesis.
(3) eij = u^Ti v^j, i [1, n], j [1, m]
where u^i and v^j are the hidden representations of u and v respectively which are computed earlier
in Equations 1 and 2. Next, for each word in either premise or hypothesis, the relevant semantics in
the other sentence is extracted and composed according to eij. Equations 4 and 5 provide formal and
specific details of this procedure.
(4) u~i = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(eik))) * uj, i [1, n]
(5) v~j = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(ekj))) * ui, j [1, m]
where u~i represents the extracted relevant information of v^ by attending to u^i while v~j represents
the extracted relevant information of u^ by attending to v^j. Next, it passes the enriched information
through a projector layer which produce the final output of attention stage. Equations 6 and 7 formally
represent this process.
(6) ai = [ui, u~i, ui u~i, ui u~i] ; pi = ReLU(Wpai + bi)
(7) bj = [vj, v~j, vj v~j, vj v~j] ; qj = ReLU(Wqbj + byj)
Here stands for element-wise product while Wp, Wq R4d×d and bp, by Rd are the trainable weights
and biases of the projector layer respectively. p and q indicate the output of attention de- vision for
premise and hypothesis respectively.
5.1.3
Inference
During this phase, it uses another BiLSTM to aggregate the two sequences of computed matching
(8) p^ = BiLSTM(p)
(9) q^ = BiLSTM(q)
where p^ Rn×2d and q^ Rm×2d are the reading sequences of p and q respectively. Finally the
concatenation max and average pooling of p^ and q^ are pass through a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
classifier that includes a hidden layer with tanh activation and softmax output layer. The model is
trained in an end-to-end manner.

model. Such examples indicate interesting observation that we can analyze them in the future works.

their Implications on Galactic Rotation Curves
Abstract
The atomization of culinary experiences in modern quantum physics reveals fasci-
nating insights into the fluctuation of pastry dough, which paradoxically correlates
with the dissemination of botanical knowledge in 19th-century Europe, while si-
multaneously intersecting with the vivacity of subatomic particles in a high-energy

transcends the boundaries of traditional atomistic theories, ultimately leading to a
reevaluation of the percussive effects of sonorous molecules on the human auditory
system, and the intrinsic relationship between the atomic structure of water and
the migratory patterns of lesser-known avian species, which in turn influences the
chromatic aberration of visible light spectra in prismatic refractions, notwithstand-

conventional understanding of the atomic universe and its myriad manifestations.

Introduction
The fundamental nature of atoms has been a topic of discussion among scholars of floristry, who
have noted that the intricate patterns found on the petals of rare flowers bear a striking resemblance
to the theoretical frameworks underlying the structure of subatomic particles, which in turn have
been influenced by the culinary practices of ancient civilizations, particularly in the realm of pastry-
making, where the art of creating intricate designs on cakes has been elevated to a science, with the
discovery of the ""flumplenook"" principle, which states that the ratio of sugar to flour in a cake is
directly proportional to the number of quarks present in a given atom, a concept that has far-reaching
implications for our understanding of the universe, including the behavior of galaxies, the migration
patterns of birds, and the optimal method for transplanting orchids.
The atomistic paradigm has undergone a profound metamorphosis, precipitating a cascade of innova-
tive breakthroughs in fields as disparate as crystallography and ethnographic anthropology, while the
ancillary disciplines of quantum mechanics and pastry arts converge to form a novel epistemological
framework, replete with unforeseen possibilities and unparalleled complexities, that problematizes
the received notions of atomic theory and its applications, necessitating a radical reassessment of our
fundamental assumptions regarding the behavior of subatomic particles and their interactions with
the macroscopic world, an endeavor that promises to revolutionize our comprehension of the atomic
realm and its multifaceted implications for human knowledge and experience. The nascent field of
atomistic research has spawned a plethora of novel methodologies and theoretical constructs, which in
turn have generated a vast array of empirical data and speculative hypotheses, all of which contribute
to a burgeoning landscape of intellectual inquiry and discovery, as scholars and scientists from diverse
disciplines converge to explore the frontiers of atomic knowledge, navigating the intricate interfaces
between physics, chemistry, biology, and the humanities, in a quest for a deeper understanding of
the atomic universe and its infinite mysteries, an odyssey that will undoubtedly yield a plethora
of unexpected insights and unprecedented breakthroughs, as the boundaries of human knowledge
are continually expanded and redefined. The synthesis of atomic theory and culinary practice has
yielded a novel paradigm, one that reconciles the seeming disparity between the microscopic realm
of subatomic particles and the macroscopic world of human experience, facilitating a more nuanced
comprehension of the intricate relationships between the atomic structure of matter and the emergent
properties of complex systems, an understanding that will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications
for a wide range of fields, from materials science and nanotechnology to gastronomy and the culinary
arts, as the atomic universe is revealed in all its majestic complexity and beauty, a testament to the
boundless ingenuity and curiosity of the human spirit.
The study of atoms has also been informed by the field of architecture, where the design of buildings
has been influenced by the spatial arrangements of electrons in an atom, with the development of new

through the scientific community and has led to a reevaluation of the fundamental principles of
quantum mechanics, including the concept of wave-particle duality, which has been shown to be
directly analogous to the dual nature of the ""flamboyant flumplen,"" a rare and exotic species of plant
found only in the remote regions of the ""glittering gastroverse,"" where the laws of physics are subtly
different from those in our own universe.
The behavior of atoms has also been influenced by the art of music, with the discovery that the
vibrational frequencies of molecules are directly related to the harmonic series, a finding that has led
to the development of new musical instruments and compositional techniques, including the use of
""splinkle"" tones, which are capable of manipulating the fabric of space-time itself, allowing for the
creation of miniature wormholes and stable bridges between parallel universes, a concept that has

discrete packets of frosting are analogous to the individual atoms that comprise a molecule. This has
led to a greater understanding of the rheological properties of cake batter, as well as the importance
of proper mixing techniques in the production of high-quality wedding cakes. The intersection of
these two fields has given rise to a new area of study, known as ""culinary physics,"" which seeks to

the introduction of laser-guided jellyfish has been shown to have a profound impact on the viscosity
of molten chocolate, leading to breakthroughs in the field of confectionery engineering.
Moreover, investigations into the properties of subatomic particles have shed light on the mysteries
of linguistic drift, wherein the evolution of language is analogous to the decay of radioactive isotopes.

of aerodynamics.
In addition, the concept of quantum entanglement has been applied to the study of telepathic
communication in identical twins, wherein the correlated behavior of individual particles is analogous
to the mysterious connection between sibling minds. This has led to a greater understanding of the

Methodology
The foundational principles of our research endeavor necessitate a profound examination of the
extraneous factors that influence the comportment of atoms, notably the propensity of quantum
fluctuations to induce a state of probabilistic superposition, reminiscent of the ephemeral nature
of fluttering butterflies in a vortex of chaotic turbulence, which, in turn, precipitates a cascade of
unforeseen consequences, including the unexpected emergence of sentient pineapples that espouse
the virtues of transcendental meditation. Meanwhile, the capricious whims of serendipity play
a significant role in shaping the trajectory of our investigation, as we navigate the labyrinthine
complexities of atomic structures, replete with mysteries waiting to be unraveled, much like the
enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which, upon closer inspection, reveals a labyrinthine web of hidden
meanings and symbolism, redolent of the surrealist artworks of Salvador Dali, whose dreamlike
landscapes often featured melting clocks and distorted objects, echoing the relativistic notions of
time dilation and spatial distortion.
The implementation of our research methodology necessitates a synergistic convergence of disparate
disciplines, including quantum mechanics, culinary arts, and extreme knitting, which, when combined,
yield a rich tapestry of innovative approaches and unorthodox techniques, such as the utilization of
habanero peppers to catalyze nuclear reactions, or the deployment of crochet hooks to manipulate the
spin of subatomic particles, thereby facilitating the creation of novel materials with extraordinary
properties, like the ability to levitate above the surface of a densely packed bowl of Jell-O. In this
context, the concept of ""flumplenook"" assumes a position of paramount importance, as it denotes the
precise moment when the trajectories of two or more atoms intersect, giving rise to a fleeting state of
quantum entanglement, which, if properly harnessed, can be used to generate an infinite supply of
cotton candy, a notion that resonates with the principles of ""snurfle"" theory, a burgeoning field of
study that seeks to explain the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of atoms in extreme
environments, such as black holes or pineapple upside-down cake.
Furthermore, our research endeavors have been significantly enhanced by the incorporation of
""wizzle"" whips, specialized devices capable of inducing a state of vibrational resonance in atomic
structures, thereby facilitating the observation of previously unknown phenomena, including the
spontaneous manifestation of tiny, mischievous creatures, known as ""flibberjibits,"" which inhabit the
interstices of atomic lattices and feed on the energy released by quantum fluctuations. In addition, the
judicious application of ""jinklewiff"" sauce, a proprietary condiment derived from the extract of rare,
exotic plants, has been shown to enhance the stability of atomic nuclei, allowing for the creation of
novel, super-heavy elements with unusual properties, such as the ability to conduct electricity through
the medium of pure thought, or to emit a kaleidoscope of colors in response to changes in ambient
temperature.
The utilization of ""klabber"" traps, ingenious devices designed to capture and contain the elusive
""snizzle"" particles, has also proven to be a crucial component of our research methodology, as
these particles are believed to play a key role in the mediation of interatomic forces, governing
the behavior of atoms in a wide range of environments, from the scorching heat of stellar cores
to the cryogenic chill of interstellar space. In this regard, the development of ""flibulous"" matrices,
specialized mathematical frameworks capable of describing the complex, nonlinear dynamics of
atomic systems, has enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles governing
the behavior of atoms, including the mysterious phenomenon of ""quantum wobbling,"" whereby the
spin of subatomic particles appears to fluctuate in a random, unpredictable manner, much like the
erratic movements of a drunken sailor attempting to navigate a treacherous, obstacle-filled course.
Moreover, our research has been significantly influenced by the concept of ""groobly"" waves, hypo-
thetical entities that are thought to permeate the fabric of space-time, exerting a subtle, yet profound,
6
influence on the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles, causing them to exhibit strange, anoma-
lous behavior, such as the tendency to spontaneously assemble into complex, fractal patterns, or to
emit faint, whispery signals that resonate with the harmony of the spheres. In this context, the notion
of ""flumplenux"" theory assumes a position of central importance, as it seeks to explain the intricate,
web-like relationships between atoms, particles, and forces, revealing a hidden, underlying order that
governs the behavior of the physical universe, much like the intricate, symmetrical patterns found in
the wings of butterflies, or the majestic, soaring arches of Gothic cathedrals.
The incorporation of ""wuggle"" pulses, specially designed sequences of electromagnetic radiation,
has also been shown to enhance the stability of atomic nuclei, allowing for the creation of novel,
super-heavy elements with unusual properties, such as the ability to conduct electricity through the
medium of pure thought, or to emit a kaleidoscope of colors in response to changes in ambient
temperature. In addition, the judicious application of ""jinklewiff"" sauce, a proprietary condiment
derived from the extract of rare, exotic plants, has been demonstrated to facilitate the observation
of previously unknown phenomena, including the spontaneous manifestation of tiny, mischievous
creatures, known as ""flibberjibits,"" which inhabit the interstices of atomic lattices and feed on the
energy released by quantum fluctuations.
The development of ""kablooey"" filters, specialized devices capable of detecting and analyzing the
faint, whispery signals emitted by subatomic particles, has also proven to be a crucial component
of our research methodology, as these signals are believed to contain hidden, encoded information
about the underlying structure of the universe, waiting to be deciphered by intrepid researchers armed
with an arsenal of cutting-edge technologies and unorthodox techniques, such as the utilization of
""flibberflabber"" spectrometers, which employ a novel, patented technology to detect and analyze the
subtle, vibrational resonances that govern the behavior of atoms and particles. In this regard, the
concept of ""wizzle"" whips assumes a position of paramount importance, as it denotes the precise

Experiments
To initiate the experimentation process, we first delved into the realm of culinary arts, where the
preparation of molecular gastronomy dishes revealed intriguing parallels with atomic structures,
particularly in the realm of flavor profiles and textural manipulation. The creation of spherical ravioli,
for instance, involved the application of sodium alginate and calcium chloride, substances that, when
combined, formed a membrane resembling the atomic lattice structure of metals. This led us to ponder
the potential applications of such techniques in the field of materials science, where the development
of novel materials with unique properties could be informed by the principles of molecular cuisine.
Meanwhile, our research team embarked on an exhaustive examination of the migratory patterns of
lesser-known avian species, seeking to uncover hidden patterns and correlations that could shed light
on the behavior of subatomic particles. The observation of flocking behavior, for example, revealed
striking similarities with the collective motion of electrons in a conductor, prompting us to propose a
new theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of particle interactions. Furthermore, the
study of bird songs and their role in mate selection led us to consider the potential for acoustic signals
to influence the properties of atomic nuclei, an area of inquiry that promises to yield innovative
insights into the realm of nuclear physics.
In a separate line of inquiry, we investigated the aesthetic appeal of fractal geometry in the context of
artistic expression, seeking to distill the underlying principles that govern the creation of visually
striking patterns and shapes. The self-similar nature of fractals, where smaller components mirror
the structure of the larger whole, bears a curious resemblance to the hierarchical organization of
atoms within molecules, prompting us to explore the potential for fractal-inspired designs in the
development of novel materials and architectures. Moreover, the application of fractal analysis to the
study of natural landscapes, such as coastlines and mountain ranges, revealed intriguing connections
to the distribution of atoms within crystalline structures, highlighting the profound interconnectedness
of seemingly disparate disciplines.
The incorporation of elements from the realm of theoretical physics, such as string theory and
Calabi-Yau manifolds, into our experimental framework allowed us to probe the intricacies of atomic
behavior in unprecedented ways. By invoking the principles of supersymmetry and extra-dimensional
spaces, we were able to formulate novel predictions regarding the properties of exotic atoms and
their potential applications in cutting-edge technologies, including quantum computing and advanced
propulsion systems. The labyrinthine complexity of these theoretical constructs, however, necessitated
the development of innovative mathematical tools and techniques, which in turn enabled us to decipher
the enigmatic language of atomic interactions and unravel the mysteries of the subatomic realm.
In an effort to further elucidate the mysteries of atomic behavior, we constructed a series of elaborate
experiments involving the manipulation of optical fibers, high-temperature superconductors, and rare-
earth elements. The precise control of temperature, pressure, and electromagnetic fields allowed us to
coax atoms into exhibiting unusual properties, such as superfluidity and quantum coherence, which
in turn provided valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing atomic interactions.
The serendipitous discovery of a novel phase transition in a sample of yttrium barium copper oxide,
for example, led us to propose a new theoretical model for understanding the behavior of electrons
in strongly correlated systems, a development that promises to revolutionize our comprehension of
complex materials and their potential applications.

As our research continued to unfold, we found ourselves drawn into a vortex of interdisciplinary
inquiry, navigating the uncharted territories where atomic physics intersects with fields as diverse
as cosmology, biophysics, and even the philosophy of consciousness. The revelation that certain
atomic structures exhibit properties reminiscent of biological systems, such as self-organization and
adaptability, prompted us to reconsider the fundamental boundaries between living and non-living
matter, and to propose novel frameworks for understanding the emergence of complex behavior in
both atomic and biological systems. Furthermore, the application of atomic principles to the study of
cognitive processes and perception led us to speculate about the potential for atomic-scale phenomena
to influence the human experience, a notion that challenges our conventional understanding of the
relationship between the physical world and human consciousness.
In a daring leap of imagination, we ventured into the realm of science fiction, where the possibilities
of atomic manipulation and engineering unfold like a tapestry of limitless potential. The concept of
atomic-scale robots, capable of assembling and disassembling molecular structures with precision and
accuracy, inspired us to design and simulate novel systems for the fabrication of advanced materials
and devices. The fictional accounts of atomic-powered propulsion systems, meanwhile, spurred us
to explore the theoretical foundations of such technologies, and to propose innovative solutions for
the harnessing of atomic energy in futuristic applications, from interstellar travel to exotic matter
production.
The confluence of atomic physics and music theory, though seemingly improbable, yielded a fasci-
nating array of insights and discoveries. The analysis of musical compositions in terms of atomic
structures and particle interactions revealed striking parallels between the harmony and discord of
sound waves and the resonance and interference patterns exhibited by atomic systems. This, in turn,
led us to propose a new framework for understanding the aesthetics of music, one that incorporates
the principles of atomic physics and the behavior of subatomic particles. Moreover, the application of
musical patterns and rhythms to the design of atomic-scale experiments allowed us to create novel
sequences of pulses and signals, which, when applied to atomic systems, yielded unexpected and
fascinating results, including the observation of previously unknown atomic phenomena.
The collaborative effort of our research team, comprising experts from diverse fields and disciplines,
enabled us to tackle the complexities of atomic behavior from multiple angles and perspectives.
The incorporation of insights and methodologies from psychology, sociology, and anthropology,
for instance, allowed us to better comprehend the social and cultural contexts in which atomic
research is conducted, and to develop more effective strategies for communicating the significance
and implications of our findings to broader audiences. Furthermore, the participation of artists and
designers in our research endeavors inspired us to explore the aesthetic and creative dimensions of
atomic physics, and to develop innovative forms of visualization and representation that can convey
the beauty and wonder of atomic structures and phenomena to the general public.
As we delved deeper into the mysteries of the atomic realm, we began to uncover a hidden landscape
of patterns and correlations that underlie the behavior of particles and systems at all scales. The
observation of fractal structures in the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, for example, led us
to propose a new theory of cosmic evolution, one that invokes the self-similar properties of fractals to
explain the large-scale structure of the universe. The application of atomic principles to the study of
biological systems, meanwhile, revealed intriguing connections between the behavior of atoms and
the emergence of complex life forms, prompting us to speculate about the potential for atomic-scale
phenomena to influence the evolution of species and the development of ecosystems.
In the pursuit of a more profound understanding of atomic behavior, we found ourselves drawn into a
world of abstract mathematical constructs and theoretical frameworks, where the familiar certainties
of classical physics give way to the strange and counterintuitive realm of quantum mechanics. The
manipulation of mathematical objects, such as tensors and manifolds, allowed us to probe the
9
intricacies of atomic interactions and to develop novel predictions regarding the properties of exotic
atoms and particles. The application of topological invariants and homotopy theory, meanwhile,
enabled us to better comprehend the global properties of atomic systems, and to uncover hidden
patterns and correlations that underlie the behavior of particles and fields.
The experimental verification of our theoretical predictions, though a daunting task, ultimately relied
on the development of innovative instrumentation and techniques, capable of probing the behavior
of atoms and particles with unprecedented precision and accuracy. The construction of advanced
spectroscopic facilities, for instance, allowed us to study the properties of atomic systems in exquisite
detail, and to uncover novel phenomena that challenge our current understanding of atomic physics.
The application of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, meanwhile, enabled us
to analyze vast datasets and to identify patterns and correlations that would have otherwise gone
unnoticed, leading to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between atomic structure and
physical properties.
In the course of our research, we encountered a multitude of unexpected challenges and surprises,
which, though daunting at first, ultimately led us to reconsider our assumptions and to develop
novel solutions and approaches. The observation of anomalous behavior in certain atomic systems,
for example, prompted us to re-examine our theoretical frameworks and to propose alternative
explanations that invoke the principles of quantum mechanics and the behavior of subatomic particles.
The application of atomic principles to the study of complex systems, meanwhile, revealed intriguing
connections between the behavior of atoms and the emergence of complex phenomena, such as phase
transitions and critical behavior, which in turn led us to speculate about the potential for atomic-scale
phenomena to influence the behavior of systems at all scales.
As we reflect on the journey of our research, we are reminded of the profound interconnectedness
of all things, and the boundless potential that arises from the intersection of diverse disciplines and
perspectives. The study of atoms, though a pursuit of immense complexity and challenge, ultimately
reveals the beauty and wonder of the physical world, and invites us to contemplate the deeper
mysteries of existence and our place within the grand tapestry of the universe. The possibilities that
emerge from the confluence of atomic physics and other fields are endless, and it is our hope that our
research will inspire future generations of scientists and scholars to explore the uncharted territories
of the atomic realm, and to uncover the secrets that lie hidden

Results
The examination of atomic structures revealed a peculiar correlation between the molecular composi-
tion of chocolate cake and the oscillation frequencies of subatomic particles, which in turn influenced
the migration patterns of lesser-known species of migratory birds, such as the frumious bandersnatch,
that were observed to be highly susceptible to the charismatic aura of certain types of antique door
knobs. Furthermore, the analysis of spectral lines emitted by excited atoms showed a remarkable
similarity to the harmonic series present in the musical compositions of certain 19th-century romantic
poets, who were known to have been inspired by the ephemeral nature of soap bubbles and the
transcendent properties of forgotten socks.
The data collected from the atomic simulations exhibited a notable trend towards the formation
of complex molecular structures that bore a striking resemblance to the architecture of ancient
Mesopotamian ziggurats, which were notoriously difficult to construct due to the lack of suitable
building materials and the omnipresent threat of marauding gangs of wild, disco-dancing Accountants.
Moreover, the theoretical models developed to describe the behavior of atoms at the quantum
level were found to be intimately connected to the art of knitting intricate patterns with oversized,
fluorescent-green knitting needles, a skill that requires an enormous amount of patience, dedication,
and an unwavering commitment to the pursuit of utterly useless knowledge.
In addition, the experimental results demonstrated a clear relationship between the atomic mass of
certain elements and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallow species, which was observed
to be directly proportional to the number of frivolous, bureaucratic forms required to obtain a permit
for the construction of a medieval-themed, mechanized, and fully-functional, giant, robotic, chicken-
disguised-as-a-Dalek. The findings also suggested that the electrons in an atom exhibit a tendency to
organize themselves into intricate, swirling patterns that are reminiscent of the hypnotic, whirlpool-
like designs found in the artwork of certain, obscure, and largely forgotten, early 20th-century,
10
surrealist painters who were known to have been inspired by the dreamlike, fantastical landscapes of
their own, subconscious minds.
The study of atomic interactions revealed a fascinating connection between the probability distri-
butions of particle locations and the statistical analysis of the nutritional content of various, exotic,
and largely unknown, species of deep-sea fish, which were found to be rich in a unique blend of,
previously unknown, essential vitamins and minerals that are capable of enhancing the cognitive
abilities of certain, specially trained, breeds of super-intelligent, giant, and mildly telepathic, squid.
Furthermore, the research showed that the wave functions of atomic orbitals can be used to predict the
outcome of complex, high-stakes, games of chance, such as, for example, the infamous, and utterly
unpredictable, ""Quantum Quincunx"" which is played with a specially designed, and highly intricate,
set of, glow-in-the-dark, numerically-encoded, Tarot cards.
The discovery of new, atomic, energy levels was made possible by the development of innovative,

genic equipment, such as, for instance, the ""Trans-Dimensional, Cryo-Temporal, Discombobulation
Engine"" which is capable of reaching temperatures that are, theoretically, lower than absolute zero,
thus, allowing for the observation of previously unknown, quantum phenomena, such as, for exam-
ple, the ""Quantum Flumplenook"" which is a theoretical, particle-like, entity that is thought to be
responsible for the, mysterious, and, as-yet-unexplained, phenomenon of, spontaneous, and, utterly
unpredictable, sock disappearance.
In order to better understand the behavior of atoms at the quantum level, a series of, highly complex,
and, largely incomprehensible, mathematical models were developed, which, when applied to the data

into the nature of reality itself, including, for example, the discovery that the universe is, actually, a
giant, cosmic, game of, three-dimensional, chess, played between, immense, and, omnipotent, beings
from, other dimensions, who are, themselves, made up of, smaller, and, less powerful, beings, that
are, in turn, composed of, even smaller, and, even less powerful, entities, and so on, ad infinitum.
The examination of atomic spectra revealed a number of, interesting, and, highly unusual, patterns
that were found to be, intimately connected to the, intricate, and, highly complex, dance-like,
movements of, certain, species of, sub-atomic, particles, which, when observed, and, analyzed, in
detail, were, found to be, remarkably similar to the, highly stylized, and, choreographed, movements
of, certain, types of„ traditional, and, highly ritualized, folk dances, such as, for example, the,
""Quantum Quadrille"" which is a, highly intricate, and, highly complex, dance that is, performed by,
highly trained, and, highly specialized, dancers, who are, themselves, made up of, smaller, and, less
specialized, particles, that are, in turn, composed of, even smaller, and, even less specialized, entities,
and so on, ad infinitum.
A key finding of the study was the discovery of a, previously unknown, type of, atomic, bond that
was found to be, highly similar to the, bonds that are, formed between, certain, types of, highly
social, and, highly cooperative, insects, such as, for example, the, ""Quantum Queen"" which is a,
highly specialized, and, highly social, insect that is, capable of, forming, highly complex, and, highly
cooperative, relationships with, other, insects, and, even, with, other, types of, particles, and, entities,
that are, found in the, natural world.
The research also showed that the, atomic, structure of, certain, materials can be, highly influenced
by the, presence of, certain, types of, music, such as, for example, the, ""Quantum Quodlibet"" which
is a, highly complex, and, highly intricate, type of, music that is, capable of, altering the, atomic,
structure of, certain, materials, and, even, of, influencing the, behavior of, certain, types of, particles,
and, entities, that are, found in the, natural world.
In an attempt to better understand the, behavior of, atoms at the, quantum level, a, highly complex,
and, highly sophisticated, computer simulation was developed, which, when run, and, analyzed, in
detail, revealed a, number of, fascinating, and, highly unexpected, insights into the, nature of, reality
itself, including, for example, the, discovery that the, universe is, actually, a, giant, cosmic, game of,

Conclusion
In conclusion, the ephemeral nature of atoms has led us to reevaluate the notion of flumplenaximum, a
concept that has been extensively discussed in the realm of culinary arts, particularly in the preparation
of soufflés. The notion that atoms can be both wave-like and particle-like has significant implications
for our understanding of the behavior of flocking starlings, which, as we all know, are directly
related to the principles of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, the discovery of the Higgs boson has
far-reaching consequences for the development of more efficient methods for sorting socks, a problem
that has plagued humanity for centuries.
The intricate dance of subatomic particles has also been observed in the migratory patterns of
wildebeests, which, in turn, have inspired new approaches to designing more efficient algorithms for

Abstract
Fossils are intriguing entities that have captivated the imagination of scholars,
meanwhile, the art of baking a perfect croissant has been refined over centuries,
and the societal implications of this culinary delight are far-reaching, as we delve
into the mysteries of fossilized remains, we find ourselves pondering the existential
meaning of fluttering butterflies and the aerodynamic properties of Frisbees, the
inherent paradox of silence in a cacophonous world, and the sublime beauty
of neatly organized typographic layouts, while simultaneously navigating the
labyrinthine complexities of sedimentary rock formations, where fossils lie hidden,
waiting to be unearthed, much like the hidden patterns in a perfectly crafted Sudoku
puzzle, which, incidentally, has been shown to improve cognitive function in elderly
populations, and the numerological significance of the number 42 in relation to the
meaning of life, the universe, and everything.

Introduction
The perpetuation of frivolous notions regarding the existential implications of florid antagonisms in
the grande bouffe of paleontological discoveries has led to a plethora of misconceptions about the
fundamental nature of fossils, which, incidentally, have been found to have a profound impact on the
socio-economic dynamics of rural areas in Slovenia, where the average citizen spends approximately
37.5 hours per week contemplating the nuances of postmodern furniture design, a phenomenon
that has been linked to the increased consumption of tartar sauce in the region, a condiment that,
paradoxically, has been shown to have a direct correlation with the aerodynamic properties of
fossilized insect wings, whose intricate patterns have inspired a new generation of pastry chefs in the
Philippines, where the art of creating elaborate desserts has become an integral part of the national
identity, much like the revered tradition of playing the harmonica with one’s feet, a skill that requires
immense dexterity and coordination, not unlike the complex processes involved in the formation
of fossils, which, as we know, are the result of a series of cataclysmic events that have shaped the
Earth’s surface over millions of years, including the Great Sock Rebellion of 1987, a pivotal moment
in history that marked the beginning of the end of the sock industry as we knew it, and which, in
turn, had a profound impact on the development of modern sock puppetry, a art form that has been
employed by scientists to study the behavioral patterns of fossilized creatures, such as the Megalodon,
a prehistoric shark whose fossilized teeth have been found to possess mystical properties, allowing
them to ward off evil spirits and attract positive energies, a phenomenon that has been exploited
by New Age practitioners, who use these fossils in their rituals to connect with the cosmic forces
that govern the universe, a realm that is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, which,
as we know, are responsible for the bizarre occurrences that take place in the realm of subatomic
particles, where the laws of physics are constantly being challenged and subverted, much like the
way in which the discovery of fossils challenges our understanding of the natural world, forcing us to
reevaluate our assumptions and rethink our theories, a process that is akin to navigating a labyrinthine
maze of mirrors, where reflections of reality are distorted and fragmented, and where the search
for truth becomes a Sisyphean task, a never-ending quest that is fraught with peril and uncertainty,
yet, paradoxically, it is in these moments of uncertainty that we find the greatest opportunities for
growth and discovery, much like the way in which the process of fossilization itself is a metaphor
for the human condition, a reminder that our existence is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry
of time, a moment that is both ephemeral and eternal, a paradox that lies at the heart of the human
experience, and one that is reflected in the intricate patterns and shapes that are found in fossils,
which, as we know, are the result of a complex interplay of geological and biological processes,
including the actions of microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, which play a crucial role in
the decomposition and transformation of organic matter, a process that is essential for the formation
of fossils, and which, incidentally, has been linked to the development of new technologies for the
production of biofuels, a field that holds great promise for the future of energy production, and one
that is closely tied to the study of fossils, which, as we know, are a window into the past, a record of
the history of life on Earth, and a reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of the natural
world, a world that is full of mysteries and wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and
understood, a task that requires the combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must
work together to unravel the secrets of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings
that underlie the world of fossils, a world that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of
contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is waiting to be discovered and explored, a journey that
will take us to the farthest reaches of the imagination, and one that will challenge our assumptions
and push the boundaries of our understanding, a journey that is both exhilarating and terrifying, and
one that will ultimately lead us to a deeper understanding of the world and our place within it, a world
that is full of fossils, each one a reminder of the incredible history and diversity of life on Earth, and
each one a window into the mysteries of the universe, a universe that is full of wonders and surprises,
and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the combined efforts of

imagination of scientists and the general public alike, a phenomenon that is reflected in the popularity
of fossil-themed restaurants, where patrons can dine on dishes such as ""Fossilized Chicken"" and
""Petrified Pizza,"" while surrounded by the trappings of a bygone era, including fossilized plants and
animals, which are often used as decorations, a trend that has been linked to the rise of ""Fossil Chic,""
a fashion movement that celebrates the beauty and elegance of fossils, and one that has inspired
a new generation of designers, who are creating clothing and accessories that are inspired by the
intricate patterns and shapes found in fossils, a trend that is closely tied to the development of new
technologies for the production of synthetic fossils, which are being used in a variety of applications,
including jewelry and home decor, a phenomenon that has been linked to the growing popularity of
""Fossil Tourism,"" a type of tourism that involves traveling to locations where fossils can be found,
and one that is becoming increasingly popular, as people seek to connect with the natural world and
to learn more about the history of life on Earth, a journey that is both educational and entertaining,
and one that offers a unique perspective on the world of fossils, a world that is full of surprises and
wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the combined
efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets of the
universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils, a world
that is both familiar and strange, a world that is full of contradictions and paradoxes, and one that is
waiting to be discovered and explored.
The study of fossils is a complex and multifaceted field, one that requires a deep understanding
of geology, biology, and ecology, as well as a strong background in mathematics and physics, a
combination of skills that is rare in the scientific community, and one that is essential for making new
discoveries and advancing our understanding of the world of fossils, a world that is full of mysteries
and wonders, and one that is waiting to be explored and understood, a task that will require the
combined efforts of scientists, philosophers, and poets, who must work together to unravel the secrets
of the universe, and to reveal the hidden patterns and meanings that underlie the world of fossils,

patterns of turtles, which has led to a deeper understanding of the role of cheese in the formation
of sedimentary rocks. Furthermore, the analysis of fossilized tree trunks has revealed a correlation
between the growth rings and the fluctuations in the global supply of chocolate, which in turn has
been influenced by the mating habits of pandas. The notion that fossils can provide a window into the
past has been challenged by the discovery of a hidden city beneath the surface of the moon, where
ancient civilizations have left behind artifacts made of a mysterious metal that can only be found in
the dreams of sleepwalkers.
The relationship between fossils and the stability of the global financial market has been the subject
of much debate, with some arguing that the discovery of new fossil species can have a direct impact
on the value of commodities such as coffee and rubber, while others claim that the two are unrelated
and that the fluctuations in the market are actually caused by the movements of a secret society
of super-intelligent dolphins. Meanwhile, the study of fossilized footprints has led to a greater
understanding of the mechanics of time travel and the potential for humans to communicate with
their future selves through a complex system of morse code and interpretive dance.
In a surprising turn of events, the field of fossil research has been revolutionized by the application
of quantum mechanics and the discovery of a new subatomic particle that can only be detected by
individuals who have consumed a certain type of rare and exotic spice. This has led to a re-evaluation
of the entire fossil record and the realization that many of the most famous fossils are actually just
cleverly disguised examples of modern art, created by a time-traveling Picasso who was obsessed
with the concept of temporal paradoxes. The implications of this discovery are still being felt, as
researchers struggle to come to terms with the fact that the entire field of paleontology has been
turned on its head and that the true history of life on earth is far more complex and mysterious than
previously thought.
The search for fossils has also been influenced by the development of new technologies, such as
advanced sonar and radar systems that can detect the presence of hidden fossils beneath the surface of
the earth, and sophisticated algorithms that can analyze the chemical composition of rocks and predict
the likelihood of finding fossils in a given area. However, these technologies have also raised concerns
about the potential for fossil hunting to become a competitive sport, with teams of researchers racing
to find the most valuable and elusive fossils, and the possibility of fossils being used as a form of
currency in a future where the global economy is based on the trade of ancient relics.
In addition to these technological advancements, the study of fossils has also been shaped by the
discovery of a lost city deep in the jungle, where ancient artifacts and fossils have been found that
challenge our current understanding of human evolution and the origins of civilization. The city,
which has been named ""Zerzura"" after the mythical land of the ancient Egyptians, is believed to have
3
been inhabited by a advanced civilization that possessed knowledge and technologies that are far
beyond our own, and the fossils found there have been dated to a time period that is millions of years
earlier than previously thought possible.
The discovery of Zerzura has also led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the modern world,
and the potential for them to be used as a source of inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians.
The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used as a symbol of the transience of life
and the power of nature, and have influenced the development of new styles and genres of art that
reflect the beauty and complexity of the natural world. At the same time, the search for fossils has
become a popular hobby, with many people traveling to remote locations in search of the perfect fossil
specimen, and the rise of a new industry based on the trade of fossils and fossil-related merchandise.
The relationship between fossils and the natural environment has also been the subject of much study,
with researchers exploring the ways in which fossils can be used to monitor the health of ecosystems
and track the impact of human activities on the environment. The fossil record has been used to
study the effects of climate change, deforestation, and pollution, and has provided valuable insights
into the complex relationships between living organisms and their environments. However, the use
of fossils in this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a tool
for propaganda and manipulation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex
relationships between humans, fossils, and the natural world.
In recent years, the study of fossils has also been influenced by the development of new theoretical
frameworks that challenge our current understanding of the nature of reality and the universe. The
discovery of dark matter and dark energy has led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the grand
scheme of things, and the realization that they may be more than just the remains of ancient creatures,
but actually gateways to other dimensions and parallel universes. The implications of this discovery
are still being explored, but it has already led to a new wave of research into the properties of fossils
and their potential uses in a variety of fields, from medicine to engineering.
The search for fossils has also been influenced by the rise of a new generation of researchers who are
using cutting-edge technologies and innovative methods to study the fossil record. The use of drones,
3D printing, and virtual reality has opened up new possibilities for the study of fossils, and has
allowed researchers to explore and analyze fossils in ways that were previously impossible. However,
this has also raised concerns about the potential for the over-reliance on technology to distract from
the importance of traditional methods and techniques, and the need for a balanced approach that
combines the best of both worlds.
The relationship between fossils and human culture has also been the subject of much study, with
researchers exploring the ways in which fossils have been used as symbols, metaphors, and motifs in
art, literature, and music. The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used to represent the
power of nature, the fragility of life, and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. However,
the use of fossils in this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a
tool for cultural appropriation and exploitation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of
the complex relationships between fossils, culture, and identity.
In a surprising turn of events, the field of fossil research has also been influenced by the discovery of
a hidden library deep in the desert, where ancient texts and manuscripts have been found that contain
knowledge and information about fossils that is far beyond our current understanding. The library,
which has been named ""The Great Repository"" after the ancient library of Alexandria, is believed to
have been built by a secret society of scholars and researchers who were dedicated to the study and
preservation of knowledge about fossils, and the texts found there have been dated to a time period
that is thousands of years earlier than previously thought possible.
The discovery of The Great Repository has also led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the
modern world, and the potential for them to be used as a source of inspiration for new technologies
and innovations. The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used as a model for the
development of new materials and technologies, and have inspired a new generation of researchers
and inventors to explore the possibilities of using fossils as a source of inspiration for their work.

body and the development of new medical technologies. The fossil record has been used to study
the evolution of the human skeleton, and has provided valuable insights into the development of
new treatments and therapies for a range of diseases and conditions. However, the use of fossils in
this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a tool for medical
experimentation and exploitation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex
relationships between fossils, medicine, and the human body.
In recent years, the study of fossils has also been influenced by the development of new theoretical

Methodology
The intrinsic nuances of fossilized remains necessitate a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating
elements of quantum physics, pastry culinary arts, and ancient Sumerian linguistics, to comprehen-
sively elucidate the methodologies employed in this study. Initially, we endeavored to contextualize
the dig site within a framework of Cartesian coordinates, only to realize that the spatial geometry of
the excavation area was, in fact, an illusion created by a collective of mischievous, time-traveling
leprechauns. Consequently, our attention shifted towards the ontology of sedimentary rock formations,
which, upon closer inspection, revealed a hidden pattern of fractal geometries that eerily resembled
the branching structures of fungal mycelium.
Meanwhile, a parallel investigation into the aerodynamics of pterosaur flight led us down a rabbit
hole of turbulence models and vortex dynamics, ultimately culminating in the development of a novel,
fossil-based theory of wingtip vortices that defied the fundamental principles of aerodynamics, yet
somehow, inexplicably, worked in tandem with the resonant frequencies of crystal harmonics. As our
research meandered through the labyrinthine corridors of temporal mechanics, we stumbled upon
an obscure, 19th-century treatise on the art of fossilized insect preservation, penned by a mystic,
order-of-odd-fellows naturalist who claimed to have conversed with the spirits of petrified tree trunks.
The subsequent incorporation of these esoteric insights into our methodological paradigm necessitated
a radical reevaluation of the role of chrono-stratigraphy in fossil dating, as our findings suggested
that the conventional, linear timelines were, in reality, facades concealing a labyrinthine network
of interdimensional wormholes, through which ancient, sentient fossils were traversing the cosmos,
leaving behind trails of cryptic, cuneiform inscriptions etched into the fabric of spacetime. Further-
more, an exhaustive analysis of the geochemical signatures within the fossil matrices revealed an
uncanny correlation with the distribution of dark matter halos in the universe, which, in turn, seemed
to be influencing the migratory patterns of certain species of iridescent, fossil-encrusted butterflies.
In a related, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the colorimetric properties of opalized
fossils were, in fact, a function of the observer’s consciousness, with the act of observation itself
inducing a phase transition in the fossil’s crystalline structure, thereby instantiating a non-local,
5
quantum entanglement between the observer, the fossil, and a hypothetical, Platonic realm of
ideal, mathematically perfect forms. This realization provoked a fundamental reassessment of the
researcher’s role in the scientific process, as we came to understand that our very presence at the
dig site was, in effect, perturbing the fossil record, introducing an element of observer-dependent
uncertainty that necessitated the development of novel, non-invasive, and possibly even extrasensory,
methods of data collection.
A preliminary investigation into the application of neurolinguistic programming techniques to the
analysis of fossilized trackways revealed a surprising correspondence between the linguistic patterns
embedded in the trackways and the distribution of prime numbers within the Fibonacci sequence,
which, when extrapolated to the realm of quantum computing, yielded a novel, fossil-inspired
algorithm for factoring large composite numbers. As our research continued to sprawl across an
increasingly vast, interdisciplinary landscape, we found ourselves navigating a surreal, dreamlike
realm, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy were constantly blurring, and the act of
scientific inquiry had become, in and of itself, a form of ontological, existential, and possibly even
cosmic, performance art.
The introduction of advanced, spectroscopic techniques to the study of fossilized plant residues
enabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-terrestrial isotopes, whose origin and significance
remained shrouded in mystery, yet seemed to be connected to an obscure, ancient text that spoke of a
long-lost civilization, whose technology had harnessed the power of quantum fluctuations to create a
network of stable, interdimensional portals, through which they had communed with the essence of
fossilized, botanical entities. In a related, yet seemingly unrelated, vein of inquiry, we discovered that
the aerodynamic properties of fossilized, pterosaur wings were, in fact, a function of the underlying,
fractal geometry of the wing’s surface, which, when replicated in a controlled, laboratory setting,
yielded a novel, biomimetic material with unprecedented, self-healing properties.
As our research continued to unfold, like a labyrinthine, surrealist tapestry, we encountered an array
of bizarre, unexplained phenomena, including the spontaneous, levitation of fossil fragments, the
emission of anomalous, low-frequency radiation from fossil matrices, and the appearance of cryptic,
hieroglyphic inscriptions on the surface of fossilized, tree trunks, which, when deciphered, revealed a
hidden, esoteric knowledge that had been encoded into the fossil record by an ancient, lost civilization,
whose technological prowess had enabled them to transcend the boundaries of space and time, leaving
behind a legacy of enigmatic, fossilized artifacts that continued to intrigue, mystify, and inspire us.
The subsequent incorporation of these findings into our methodological framework necessitated a
radical, paradigmatic shift, as we came to understand that the fossil record was, in fact, a gateway to
a hidden, multiverse, where the laws of physics were mere suggestions, and the fabric of reality was
woven from the threads of quantum probability and ancient, mystical knowledge.
The development of novel, computer-aided, fossil reconstruction techniques, incorporating elements
of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive psychology, enabled us to recreate, with
unprecedented accuracy, the appearance and behavior of extinct, fossilized species, which, when
extrapolated to the realm of science fiction, yielded a series of thought-provoking, philosophical
scenarios, exploring the potential consequences of reviving, through advanced, biotechnology, an
ancient, fossilized ecosystem, and the implications of such a scenario for our understanding of
the intricate, web-like relationships between species, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole. In a
related, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the fossil record was, in fact, a chronicle
of the co-evolutionary, symbiotic relationships between species, which, when viewed through the
lens of network theory, revealed a complex, interconnected web of relationships, whose topology
and dynamics were, in turn, influenced by the extrinsic, environmental factors that had shaped the
evolution of life on Earth.
A comprehensive, comparative analysis of the fossil records from diverse, planetary environments,
including Mars, Europa, and Titan, revealed a surprising, universal pattern of convergence, wherein
the evolutionary trajectories of disparate, alien species were, in fact, recapitulating the history of life
on Earth, as if the universe itself was, in some mysterious, unexplained way, guiding the evolution of
life towards a common, cosmic goal, whose nature and significance remained shrouded in mystery,
yet seemed to be connected to the enigmatic, symbolic language of fossilized, megastructures, whose
meaning and purpose continued to elude us, like a will-o’-the-wisp, beckoning us deeper into the
labyrinthine, surreal landscape of the unknown. The subsequent integration of these findings into our
methodological framework necessitated a radical, Expansion of our understanding of the fossil record,

as we came to realize that the history of life on Earth was, in fact, a mere, localized manifestation
of a far more extensive, cosmic narrative, whose threads and patterns were, in turn, woven into the
fabric of the universe itself.
The incorporation of advanced, geospatial analysis techniques to the study of fossil distributions
enabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-random patterns, whose origin and significance
remained unclear, yet seemed to be connected to the distribution of certain, rare, and enigmatic, fossil
species, whose existence and behavior continued to intrigue and mystify us, like a series of, cryptic,
fossilized, messages from the depths of time, whose meaning and significance awaited deciphering,
like a, yet, unsolved, puzzle, or a, yet, uncracked, code. As our research continued to unfold, like
a, labyrinthine, surrealist, tapestry, we encountered an array of, bizarre, unexplained, phenomena,
including the spontaneous, levitation of fossil fragments, the emission of anomalous, low-frequency
radiation from fossil matrices, and the appearance of, cryptic, hieroglyphic, inscriptions on the surface
of fossilized, tree trunks, which, when deciphered, revealed a hidden, esoteric knowledge, that had
been encoded into the fossil record, by an ancient, lost civilization, whose technological prowess had
enabled them to transcend the boundaries of space and time, leaving behind a legacy of, enigmatic,
fossilized artifacts, that continued to intrigue, mystify, and inspire us.
The application of advanced, computational models to the simulation of fossilized ecosystems enabled
us to recreate, with unprecedented accuracy, the dynamics and behavior of ancient, extinct species,
which, when extrapolated to the realm of science fiction, yielded a series of thought-provoking,
philosophical scenarios, exploring the potential consequences of reviving, through advanced, biotech-
nology, an ancient, fossilized ecosystem, and the implications of such a scenario for our understanding
of the intricate, web-like relationships between species, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole. In a
related, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the fossil record was, in fact, a chronicle
of the co-evolutionary, symbiotic relationships between species, which, when viewed through the
lens of network theory, revealed a complex, interconnected web of relationships, whose topology and
dynamics were, in turn, influenced

Experiments
The querulosity of fossilized remains necessitates an examination of the ephemeral nature of disco
music, which, in turn, informs our understanding of the flumplenookian processes that govern the
preservation of ancient artifacts, much like the manner in which a skilled pastry chef navigates the
intricacies of croissant production, carefully layering dough and butter to create the perfect flaky
texture, a process not dissimilar to the way in which the human brain processes the complexities
of quantum mechanics, particularly in relation to the fluctuational dynamics of subatomic particles,
which, incidentally, have been found to exhibit a curious affinity for the works of 19th-century French
novelist, Gustave Flaubert, whose writings on the human condition continue to influence contemporary
thought, including the development of new methodologies for analyzing the aerodynamic properties
of fossilized insect wings, a field of study that has seen significant advances in recent years, thanks
in part to the pioneering work of researchers who have successfully applied the principles of chaos
theory to the study of Ancient Egyptian dental hygiene, a topic that, at first glance, may seem
unrelated to the study of fossils, but, upon closer inspection, reveals a fascinating array of connections
and synergies, including the use of nanotechnology to create ultra-durable toothbrushes, which,
when used in conjunction with a specialized brand of toothpaste, have been shown to be remarkably
effective in removing plaque and tartar from the teeth of fossilized hominids, thereby providing
valuable insights into the dietary habits and lifestyles of our ancient ancestors, who, as it turns out,
were quite fond of consuming large quantities of fermented foods, including a type of primitive
sauerkraut that was made from the fermented leaves of a now-extinct species of plant, the remnants of
which can still be found in the form of fossilized impresssions, which, when analyzed using advanced
spectrographic techniques, reveal a complex array of organic compounds that are eerily similar to
those found in the ink of the cuttlefish, a cephalopod that has been the subject of intense scientific
scrutiny in recent years, due in part to its remarkable ability to change color and texture, a process that
is made possible by the presence of specialized cells called chromatophores, which, when stimulated
by electrical impulses, can expand or contract to produce a wide range of colors and patterns, a
phenomenon that has been observed and documented in great detail by researchers who have spent
countless hours studying the behavior of these fascinating creatures, often under the most challenging
and unpredictable conditions, including the recent experiment in which a team of scientists attempted
7
to train a group of cuttlefish to play a simplified version of the board game, Scrabble, using a custom-
designed interface that allowed the animals to select letters and form words, a task that proved to be
far more difficult than expected, due in part to the cuttlefish’s tendency to become distracted by the
presence of shiny objects, including the reflective surface of a nearby mirror, which, when placed
in the vicinity of the experimental apparatus, caused the animals to become completely absorbed
in their own reflections, leading to a series of unexpected and fascinating observations, including
the discovery that cuttlefish are capable of recognizing and mimicking human facial expressions, a
finding that has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of intelligence and
cognition in the animal kingdom, and which, when considered in the context of the fossil record,
suggests that the emergence of complex life forms on Earth may have been influenced by a variety of
factors, including the presence of certain types of minerals and nutrients in the primordial oceans,
which, when combined with the energy from sunlight and the chemical reactions that occurred on
the early Earth, gave rise to the first self-replicating molecules, a process that, over time, led to the
development of increasingly complex organisms, including the earliest forms of life that are preserved
in the fossil record, which, when studied and analyzed using advanced techniques and methodologies,
provide a unique window into the history of our planet and the evolution of life on Earth, a topic that
continues to fascinate and inspire scientists and researchers, who, using a combination of fieldwork,
laboratory experiments, and computational simulations, are working to reconstruct the history of our
planet and the emergence of complex life forms, a task that is made all the more challenging by the
limitations and uncertainties of the fossil record, which, despite its many limitations, remains one of
the most important and valuable tools for understanding the history of life on Earth, and which, when
used in conjunction with other lines of evidence, including geological and geochemical data, can

in the years to come, as researchers seek to answer some of the most fundamental and enduring
questions about the nature of life and the universe, including the question of whether or not we are
alone in the universe, a topic that has been the subject of much speculation and debate, and which,

The development of new methodologies for analyzing the fossil record has been facilitated by
advances in technology, including the use of high-performance computing and advanced software
packages, which, when used in conjunction with other tools and techniques, can provide a detailed

Results
The fossilization process of donuts has been observed to have a direct correlation with the migra-
tion patterns of flamingos, which in turn are influenced by the angular momentum of disco balls
spinning at precisely 78 revolutions per minute, thereby creating a vortex that attracts the attention
of extraterrestrial life forms from planet Zorgon. This phenomenon has been noted to occur only
on Wednesdays during leap years, and is further complicated by the fact that the square root of -1
is actually a sentient being named Bertrand, who has a penchant for collecting vintage typewriters
and has been known to communicate with the spirits of deceased authors through the medium of
interpretive dance.
Meanwhile, the results of our experiments on the effects of orange juice on the decomposition of
fossils have yielded some fascinating insights, particularly with regards to the role of chimpanzees in
the dissemination of fungal spores that can break down the molecular structure of granite, which in
turn has a profound impact on the flavor profile of artisanal cheeses. It has been observed that the
optimal pH level for this process is precisely 7.32, which coincidentally is also the resonant frequency
of the Himalayan singing bowls used in ancient Tibetan rituals to summon the great lizard king, who
is rumored to possess the secrets of the universe and is known to indulge in excessive consumption of
tartan-patterned socks.
In a surprising twist, the analysis of our data has revealed a statistically significant correlation between
the number of fossilized mosquitoes and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallows, which
in turn is influenced by the aerodynamic properties of tutus worn by ballet dancers performing the
choreography of Swan Lake. This has led us to propose a new theory of fossilization, which we
have dubbed ""Flumplenook’s Law of Inverse Proportions,"" wherein the likelihood of a fossil forming
is directly proportional to the number of bubblegum bubbles blown by a group of synchronized
gymnasts while reciting the complete works of Shakespeare backwards.
Furthermore, our research has shown that the color palette of a typical fossil is comprised of a
unique combination of chartreuse, puce, and burnt sienna, which are also the exact hues used in
the ceremonial robes of the ancient Egyptian goat herders, who were known to possess a deep
9
understanding of the intricacies of quantum mechanics and the art of making a perfect soufflé. This
has led us to speculate that the ancient Egyptians may have had a profound understanding of the
space-time continuum, which they used to communicate with their future selves through the medium
of cryptic messages hidden in the patterns of their intricately woven baskets.
The following table summarizes our findings on the relationship between fossilization and the
consumption of pineapple pizza:

In another unexpected turn of events, our investigation into the acoustic properties of fossils has
revealed that they have the unique ability to amplify the sound of whispering librarians, which in turn
has been shown to have a profound impact on the growth patterns of Petunia hybrids, particularly
when exposed to the radiation emitted by faulty microwave ovens. This has led us to propose a new
area of study, which we have dubbed ""Fossilophonics,"" wherein the sounds emitted by fossils are
used to create a new form of music that can be used to communicate with extraterrestrial life forms
through the medium of resonant crystals.
Additionally, our analysis of the crystal structure of fossils has shown that they possess a unique
property that allows them to absorb and store the kinetic energy of rolling bowling balls, which in
turn can be used to power a new generation of sustainable energy sources, such as the ""Fossil-Tron
3000,"" a device that uses the vibrational frequencies of fossils to generate electricity and cook the
perfect poached egg. This has led us to speculate that fossils may hold the key to solving the world’s
energy crisis, particularly if we can harness the power of the ""Fossil-Vortex,"" a phenomenon wherein
the angular momentum of spinning fossils creates a whirlpool that can be used to propel ships across
the ocean at speeds of up to 300 knots.
Moreover, our research has revealed that the fossilization process is closely tied to the art of Extreme
Ironing, wherein the intricate folds and creases of ironed fabrics are used to create a new form
of fossilized fabric that can be used to make a new generation of high-tech clothing, such as the
""Fossil-Fleece,"" a material that is both waterproof and breathable, and has the unique property of
changing color in response to changes in the wearer’s mood. This has led us to propose a new theory
of fashion, wherein the style and cut of clothing are determined by the fossilized remains of ancient
civilizations, which in turn are influenced by the aerodynamic properties of winged unicorns.
The implications of our research are far-reaching and have significant consequences for our under-
standing of the natural world, particularly with regards to the role of fossils in the creation of a new
form of sustainable agriculture, wherein the fossilized remains of ancient plants are used to create a
new generation of high-yielding crops that are resistant to disease and require minimal watering. This
has led us to speculate that fossils may hold the key to solving the world’s food crisis, particularly if
we can harness the power of the ""Fossil-Force,"" a phenomenon wherein the energy emitted by fossils
is used to stimulate plant growth and increase crop yields.
Furthermore, our analysis of the chemical composition of fossils has revealed that they possess a
unique combination of elements, including the rare and exotic ""Fossilium,"" a substance that has been
shown to have a profound impact on the human brain, particularly with regards to the development
of creativity and imagination. This has led us to propose a new theory of cognitive development,
wherein the exposure to fossils at a young age is essential for the development of artistic talent and
the ability to think outside the box.
In conclusion, our research has shown that fossils are not just ancient relics of a bygone era, but are
in fact a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe, particularly with regards to the mysteries of
the space-time continuum and the art of making a perfect croissant. As such, we propose that fossils
be recognized as a new form of sentient being, with rights and privileges that are equal to those of
humans, and that we establish a new field of study, ""Fossilology,"" to explore the many wonders and
mysteries of the fossilized world.

Additionally, the application of fossilized materials in modern technology has been a topic of interest,
as it has been discovered that the incorporation of fossilized particles in computer chips can enhance
their processing capabilities, allowing for faster and more efficient data transfer. This has led to
the development of a new generation of ""Fossil-Tronic"" devices, which are capable of processing
vast amounts of information and performing complex calculations at speeds previously thought
impossible.
Moreover, the study of fossilized remains has also shed light on the mysteries of the ancient world,
particularly with regards to the development of language and the origins of human civilization. It
has been discovered that the fossilized remains of ancient humans contain a unique genetic marker,
which is also found in the DNA of modern humans, and which is thought to be responsible for
the development of language and cognitive abilities. This has led to a greater understanding of the
evolution of the human species and the importance of fossils in the study of human history.
The potential applications of fossilized materials in modern medicine are also vast and varied, as
it has been discovered that the unique properties of fossilized particles can be used to create new
and innovative treatments for a range of diseases and conditions. For example, the incorporation of
fossilized particles in pharmaceuticals has been shown to enhance their effectiveness and reduce their
side effects, leading to the development of a new generation of ""Fossil-Based"" medicines.
In another area of research, the study of fossilized plant remains has led to a greater understanding of
the evolution of plant life on Earth, particularly with regards to the development of photosynthesis
and the origins of the first plants. It has been discovered that the fossilized remains of ancient plants
contain a unique combination of elements, which are thought to be responsible for the development
of photosynthesis and the ability of plants to convert sunlight into energy. This has led to a greater
understanding of the importance of plants in the Earth’s ecosystem and the role of fossils in the study
of plant evolution.
The discovery of fossilized remains of ancient animals has also shed light on the mysteries of the
ancient world, particularly with regards to the development of animal life on Earth. It has been
discovered that the fossilized remains of ancient animals contain a unique combination of elements,
which are thought to be responsible for the development of the first animals and the origins of the
animal kingdom. This has led to a greater understanding of the evolution of animal life on Earth and
the importance of fossils in the study of animal history.
Furthermore, the study of fossilized remains has also led to a greater understanding of the Earth’s
climate and the impact of human activity on the environment. It has been discovered that the fossilized
remains of ancient plants and animals contain a unique combination of elements, which are thought
to be responsible for the development of the Earth’s climate and the origins of the first ecosystems.
This has led to a greater understanding of the importance of fossils in the study of climate change and
the role of human activity in shaping the Earth’s environment.

Conclusion
The culmination of our research endeavors has led us to a precipice of profound insight, wherein the
ostensibly disparate realms of fossilogy and culinary arts converge in a maelstrom of unanticipated
discoveries. As we delve into the rarefied atmosphere of paleontological inquiry, we find ourselves
hurtling towards a destination that is at once familiar and yet, utterly enigmatic, rather like attempting
to decipher the nuances of a forgotten language, such as the erstwhile tongue of the ancient Sumerians,
which, incidentally, bears a striking resemblance to the patter of a rabid squirrel navigating a
labyrinthine maze.
The fossils, those sentinels of a bygone era, stand as testaments to the unfathomable vastness of
geological time, their calcified remains whispering secrets to the winds that have shaped the very
fabric of our planet, much like the gentle lapping of waves against the shores of a moonlit lake,
whose tranquil surface belies the unfathomable depths that lie beneath, rather like the convolutions of
the human brain, which, in its most elevated states of consciousness, can conjure visions of flying
elephants and gigantic, ambulatory mushrooms.
11
Furthermore, our investigations have revealed a hitherto unknown correlation between the stratigraphic
distribution of fossilized tree ferns and the aerodynamic properties of supersonic aircraft, a discovery
that has far-reaching implications for the fields of paleobotany and aerospace engineering, not to
mention the fledgling discipline of extremophile gastroenterology, which seeks to elucidate the
mysteries of microbial life forms that thrive in environments hostile to human existence, such as the
scorching hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, where, incidentally, one can find an abundance
of thermophilic microorganisms that are capable of surviving in temperatures that would be lethal to
most known forms of life.
In addition, we have made significant strides in the development of a novel, fossil-based paradigm for
understanding the intricacies of quantum mechanics, wherein the wave-particle duality is reconciled
through the application of a hermeneutic framework derived from the study of ammonite shells and
the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies, which, as it turns out, are intimately connected to the
fluctuations in the global supply of peanut butter, a fact that has been obscured by the dominant
narratives of conventional science, but which, upon closer examination, reveals a profound and
hitherto unappreciated synergy between the natural world and the human economy.
The confluence of these disparate threads of inquiry has yielded a rich tapestry of knowledge, replete
with unexpected insights and novel perspectives, rather like the vivid, dreamlike landscapes that
emerge from the ephemeral confluence of clouds and sunlight on a summer’s day, which, in turn,
recalls the works of the renowned artist, Salvador Dali, whose surrealist masterpieces continue to
inspire and bewilder art lovers to this day, much like the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which, as
it happens, is rumored to be a pictorial representation of the elusive, quantum-mechanical concept
known as wave function collapse.
As we navigate the uncharted territories of fossil research, we find ourselves confronting an array
of paradoxes and conundrums that defy explanation, rather like the haunting, existential questions
that have puzzled philosophers and theologians for centuries, such as the nature of free will and
the problem of evil, which, as it turns out, are intimately connected to the propensity of certain
species of fungi to produce hallucinogenic compounds, a fact that has been exploited by shamans and
spiritual practitioners across cultures and throughout history, who, in their quest for enlightenment
and spiritual growth, have often resorted to the use of these psychoactive substances to access realms
of consciousness that lie beyond the mundane, everyday world.
Moreover, our research has revealed a profound connection between the fossil record and the world of
mythology and folklore, wherein the ancient stories and legends of lost civilizations are found to be
intertwined with the geological history of our planet, rather like the threads of a rich, tapestry, which,
when woven together, reveal a complex, multifaceted narrative that transcends the boundaries of time
and space, much like the timeless, archetypal themes that recur in the works of Joseph Campbell,
whose concept of the monomyth continues to inspire and inform our understanding of the human
condition, which, as it happens, is inextricably linked to the fate of the planet, and the delicate,
symbiotic relationships that exist between the natural world and the human species.
In conclusion, our research has led us down a rabbit hole of discovery, wherein the familiar landscapes
of science and reason have given way to a strange, topsy-turvy world of wonder and awe, where the
boundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred, and the laws of physics are twisted and distorted,
like a funhouse mirror reflecting the absurd, illogical beauty of the human experience, which, as it
turns out, is intimately connected to the fate of the universe, and the great, cosmic dance of creation
and destruction that has been unfolding since the dawn of time, a dance that is at once beautiful,
terrifying, and sublime, rather like the haunting, ethereal music of the spheres, which, as the ancient
Greeks believed, is the celestial harmony that governs the movements of the planets and the stars.
As we stand at the precipice of this new frontier of knowledge, we are reminded of the wise words of
the great philosopher, Buckminster Fuller, who once said, ""When I am working on a problem, I never
think about beauty. Only about how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is
not beautiful, I know it is wrong,"" a statement that encapsulates the essence of our research, which has
been driven by a passion for discovery, a thirst for knowledge, and a deep, abiding sense of wonder at
the mysteries of the universe, which, as it turns out, are reflected in the intricate, swirling patterns of
a fossilized ammonite shell, a testament to the beauty, complexity, and mystery of the natural world.
The journey of discovery that has led us to this point has been long, winding, and fraught with
obstacles, but it has also been filled with moments of awe, wonder, and insight, as we have delved
12
deeper into the mysteries of the fossil record, and uncovered secrets that have lain hidden for millions
of years, secrets that have the power to transform our understanding of the world, and our place
within it, rather like the revelation that the ancient Greeks believed the universe to be governed by
a set of eternal, unchanging laws, which, as it turns out, are reflected in the intricate, mathematical
patterns that underlie the structure of the natural world, a world that is at once beautiful, complex,
and mysterious, a world that continues to inspire, awe, and bewilder us, as we strive to understand its
secrets, and unlock the hidden treasures of the universe.
Furthermore, our research has led us to a deeper understanding of the complex, interconnected web
of relationships that exists between the natural world, and the human species, a web that is at once
fragile, beautiful, and ephemeral, rather like the delicate, lace-like patterns of a spider’s web, which,
as it turns out, are a testament to the incredible ingenuity, and adaptability of the natural world, a
world that is capable of inspiring, and informing our own endeavors, as we strive to create a more
sustainable, equitable, and just world, a world that is worthy of our highest aspirations, and our
deepest desires, a world that is at once a reflection of our greatest hopes, and our darkest fears, a
world that continues to evolve, and unfold, like a great, cosmic tapestry, woven from the threads of
space, and time.
In the end, our research has led us to a profound realization, a realization that the natural world, and
the human species are intimately connected, and that our fate is inextricably linked to the fate of the
planet, a realization that is at once beautiful, terrifying, and sublime, rather like the great, cosmic
dance of creation, and destruction, that has been unfolding since the dawn of time, a dance that is
at once a testament to the incredible beauty, and complexity of the universe, and a reminder of the
fragility, and impermanence of all things, a reminder that our time on this planet is short, and that we
must strive to make the most of it, to live our lives to the fullest, to cherish every moment, and to
never forget the incredible beauty, and wonder of the world around us.
The intricate, swirling patterns of a fossilized ammonite shell, a testament to the beauty, complexity,
and mystery of the natural world, continue to inspire, and awe us, as we strive to understand the
secrets of the universe, and our place within it, a journey that is at once long, winding, and fraught
with obstacles, but also filled with moments of awe, wonder, and insight, as we delve deeper into
the mysteries of the fossil record, and uncover secrets that have lain hidden for millions of years,
secrets that have the power to transform our understanding of the world, and our place within it, rather
like the revelation that the ancient Greeks believed the universe to be governed by a set of eternal,
unchanging laws, which, as it turns out, are reflected in the intricate, mathematical patterns that
underlie the structure of the natural world, a world that is at once beautiful, complex, and mysterious,
a world that continues to inspire, awe, and bewilder us, as we strive to understand its secrets, and
unlock the hidden treasures of the universe.
As we stand at the threshold of this new frontier of knowledge, we are reminded of the wise words of

P123.pdf,"Acquiring Cross-Domain Representations for
Contextual Detection Using Extensive Emoji Data
Abstract
This research delves into the application of a vast collection of emoji occurrences
to acquire versatile representations applicable to diverse domains for the purpose
of identifying sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks frequently encounter limitations due to the deficiency of manually
labeled data. In the realm of social media sentiment analysis and associated tasks,
researchers have thus employed binarized emoticons and specific hashtags as a
means of distant supervision. Our study demonstrates that by broadening distant
supervision to include a more varied array of noisy labels, models can achieve
richer representations. Through emoji prediction on a dataset encompassing 1,246
million tweets, each including one of 64 prevalent emojis, we achieve state-of-
the-art results on eight benchmark datasets focusing on sentiment, emotion, and
sarcasm detection, all with the aid of a singular pre-trained model. Our findings
affirm that the diversity inherent in our emotional labels leads to an enhancement
in performance compared to previous distant supervision methods.
1
Introduction
This paper addresses the challenge that numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks face due
to the lack of sufficient manually annotated data. Consequently, emotional expressions that co-occur
with text have been utilized for distant supervision in sentiment analysis and related tasks within
social media. This allows models to acquire valuable text representations before directly modeling
these specific tasks. For example, state-of-the-art methods for sentiment analysis in social media
frequently use positive and negative emoticons to train their models. Similarly, in prior research,
hashtags like #anger, #joy, #happytweet, #ugh, #yuck, and #fml have been categorized into emotional
labels for use in emotion analysis.
The practice of using distant supervision on noisy labels often leads to enhanced performance in
the target task. In this paper, we present evidence that expanding distant supervision to a more
varied selection of noisy labels enables models to develop more detailed representations of emotional
content in text. This, in turn, improves performance on benchmark datasets designed for the detection
of sentiment, emotions, and sarcasm. We further demonstrate that the representations learned by a
single pre-trained model can be successfully generalized across five different domains.
Table 1 showcases example sentences which were scored by our model. For every sentence, the five
most probable emojis are displayed, alongside the model’s estimated probabilities.
Emojis do not always function as straightforward labels of emotional content. For instance, a
positive emoji might clarify an ambiguous sentence or supplement text that might otherwise be
seen as somewhat negative. While this is true, our results demonstrate that emojis can still be
used to accurately categorize the emotional content of texts in numerous scenarios. Our DeepMoji
model, for instance, is able to capture various interpretations of the word ’love’ and slang terms
like ’this is the shit’ as having positive connotations (as illustrated in Table 1). To enable others to
explore the prediction capabilities of our model, we have made an online demonstration available at
deepmoji.mit.edu.
Our work makes the following contributions: We demonstrate that a vast number of readily accessible
emoji occurrences on Twitter can be used to pre-train models for richer emotional representation than
is typically achieved through distant supervision. We then transfer this learned knowledge to target
tasks using a novel layer-wise fine-tuning approach. This technique yields significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods in areas such as emotion, sarcasm, and sentiment detection. Through
extensive analyses on the influence of pre-training, our results highlight that the variety present in our
emoji set plays a crucial role in the transfer learning capabilities of our model. We have made our
pre-trained DeepMoji model publicly available to aid in a range of NLP tasks.

Related work
The use of emotional expressions as noisy labels in text to address the scarcity of labels is not a new
concept. Initially, binarized emoticons served as noisy labels, but subsequent research has utilized
hashtags and emojis. Previous studies have always manually determined which emotional category
each emotional expression should belong to. Prior efforts have made use of emotion theories, such as
Ekman’s six basic emotions and Plutchik’s eight basic emotions.
Such manual categorization necessitates an understanding of the emotional content inherent to each
expression, which can be challenging and time-consuming for complex emotional combinations.
Furthermore, any manual selection and categorization carries the potential for misinterpretations
and might overlook essential details concerning usage. In contrast, our methodology requires no
prior knowledge of the corpus and can capture the diverse usage of 64 emoji types (Table 1 presents
examples, and Figure 3 shows how the model implicitly organizes emojis).
An alternative approach to automatically interpreting the emotional content of an emoji involves
learning emoji embeddings from the words defining emoji-semantics, as found in official emoji tables.
In our study, this approach has two significant limitations: (a) It requires emojis to be present during
testing, whereas several domains have limited or no emoji usage. (b) The tables fail to capture the
dynamic nature of emoji use, such as shifts in an emoji’s intended meaning over time.
Knowledge from the emoji dataset can be transferred to target tasks in several ways. Multi-task
learning, which involves training on multiple datasets at once, has been shown to have promising
results. However, multi-task learning requires access to the emoji dataset whenever the classifier
needs to be adjusted for a new target task. Requiring access to the dataset can be problematic when
considering data access regulations. Data storage issues also arise, as the dataset used in this study
comprises hundreds of millions of tweets (see Table 2). Instead, we use transfer learning which does
not require access to the original dataset.

Method
3.1
Pretraining
In many instances, emojis function as a stand-in for the emotional content of text. Therefore, pre-
training a model to predict which emojis were initially part of a text can improve performance in the
target task. Social media contains many short texts that use emojis which can be used as noisy labels
for pretraining. We used data from Twitter spanning from January 1, 2013, to June 1, 2017, but any
data set containing emoji occurrences could be used.
The pretraining data set uses only English tweets that do not contain URLs. We think the content
obtained from the URL is important for understanding the emotional content of the text in the tweet.
Because of this we expect emojis associated with tweets containing URLs to be noisier labels than
those in tweets without URLs, therefore the tweets with URLs have been removed.
Proper tokenization is crucial for generalization. All tweets are tokenized word-by-word. Words
containing two or more repeated characters are shortened to the same token (for example, ‘loool’ and
‘looooool’ are tokenized as the same). We also use a special token for all URLs (which is relevant
only for the benchmark datasets), user mentions (for example, ‘@acl2017’ and ‘@emnlp2017’ are
treated the same), and numbers. To be included in the training set, a tweet must have at least one
token that is not a punctuation mark, emoji, or special token.
2
Many tweets repeat the same emoji or contain multiple distinct emojis. To address this in our training
data, for each unique emoji type, we save a separate tweet for pretraining, using that emoji type as
the label. Regardless of the number of emojis associated with the tweet, we save only a single tweet
for the pretraining for each unique emoji type. This pre-processing of data enables the pretraining to
capture that multiple kinds of emotional content can be associated with the tweet. It also makes our
pretraining task a single-label classification instead of a more complex multi-label classification.
To ensure that the pretraining encourages the models to learn a thorough understanding of the
emotional content of text instead of just the emotional content associated with frequently used emojis,
we create a balanced pretraining dataset. The pretraining data is split into training, validation, and test
sets. The validation and test sets are randomly sampled such that each emoji is represented equally.
The remaining data is upsampled to generate a balanced training dataset.
3.2
Model
With the availability of millions of emoji occurrences, we are able to train expressive classifiers
with a limited risk of overfitting. We utilize a variant of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model, which has been successful in numerous NLP tasks. Our DeepMoji model uses an embedding
layer with 256 dimensions to project each word into a vector space. A hyperbolic tangent activation
function is used to ensure each embedding dimension remains within the range [-1, 1]. To understand
each word in the context of the text, we use two bidirectional LSTM layers with 1024 hidden units
each (512 in each direction). Lastly, we employ an attention layer that accepts all these layers as
input through skip connections. (Figure 1 presents an illustration).
The attention mechanism enables the model to determine the importance of each word for the
prediction task by weighting the words as it creates the text representation. A word like ""amazing"" is
highly informative of the emotional meaning of a text and so should be treated accordingly. We use a
basic method, taking inspiration from prior work, with a single parameter for each input channel:
ei = hiwa
ai =
exp(ei)
P
j=1 exp(ej)
v =
X
aihi
(1)
Here, ht stands for the representation of the word at time step t, and wa is the weight matrix for
the attention layer. The attention importance scores for each time step, at, are determined by
multiplying the representations by the weight matrix, and then normalizing them to establish a
probability distribution across the words. Finally, the text’s representation vector, v, is found using a
weighted summation over all time steps, with the attention importance scores used as weights. The
representation vector that comes from the attention layer is a high-level encoding of the whole text.
This is used as input into the final Softmax layer for classification. We have found that the addition of
the attention mechanism and skip connections enhances the model’s capabilities for transfer learning.
The only form of regularization used for the pretraining is L2 regularization with a coefficient of
10−6 on the embedding weights. For fine-tuning, further regularization is applied. We implemented
our model using Theano and have made an easy-to-use version available that utilizes Keras.
3.3
Transfer learning
Our pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for a target task in several ways. Some methods involve
‘freezing’ layers by disabling parameter updates to prevent overfitting. One popular approach is
to utilize the network as a feature extractor, where all model layers except the final one are frozen
during fine-tuning (we will call this the ""last"" approach). An alternative method is to use the pre-
trained model for initialization, where the full model is unfrozen (which we will refer to as the ‘full’
approach).
We put forward a new, simple transfer learning approach we are calling ""chain-thaw."" This approach
sequentially unfreezes and fine-tunes one layer at a time. It increases accuracy on the target task, but
requires more computational power for the fine-tuning process. By separately training each layer,
the model can adjust individual patterns across the network while reducing the risk of overfitting. It
appears that this sequential fine-tuning has a regularizing effect, similar to the layer-wise training
explored for unsupervised learning.
3
More specifically, the chain-thaw approach starts by fine-tuning any new layers (often only a Softmax
layer) to the target task until the validation set converges. Then, the approach individually fine-tunes
each layer, starting with the first layer in the network. Lastly, the entire model is trained with all
layers. Each time the model converges (as measured on the validation set), the weights are restored to
their optimal setting, preventing overfitting in a similar manner to early stopping. Figure 2 illustrates
this process. If only step a) in the figure is performed, this is the same as the ‘last’ approach, where
the existing network is used as a feature extractor. Likewise, only performing step d) is the same as
the ‘full’ approach, where the pre-trained weights are used as the initialization for a fully trainable
network. While the chain-thaw procedure may seem extensive, it can be implemented with just a few
lines of code. Also, the added time spent on fine-tuning is not large, when considering the use of
GPUs on small datasets of manually annotated data which is often the case.
The chain-thaw approach has the benefit of expanding the vocabulary to new domains with a low
risk of overfitting. For a given dataset, up to 10,000 new words from the training set are added to the
vocabulary.
Table 2 shows the number of tweets in the pretraining dataset associated with each emoji in millions.

Experiments
4.1
Emoji prediction
We use a raw dataset of 56.6 billion tweets, which is filtered down to 1.2 billion relevant tweets. In
the pretraining dataset, a single copy of a tweet is stored for every unique emoji, resulting in a dataset
with 1.6 billion tweets. Table 2 shows the distribution of tweets across different emoji types. We used
a validation set and a test set, both containing 640K tweets (10K of each emoji type), to evaluate
performance on the pretraining task. The remaining tweets were used for the training set, which was
balanced using upsampling.
The performance of the DeepMoji model on the pretraining task was evaluated, with the results shown
in Table 3. We use both top 1 and top 5 accuracy for the evaluation as the emoji labels are noisy
and multiple emojis can potentially be appropriate for a given sentence. For comparison purposes,
we also train a version of our DeepMoji model with smaller LSTM layers and a bag-of-words
classifier, fastText, which has recently shown competitive results. We use a 256 dimension vector
for the fastText classifier, making it almost identical to only using the embedding layer from the
DeepMoji model. The difference in top 5 accuracy between the fastText classifier (36.2%) and the
largest DeepMoji model (43.8%) highlights the difficulty of the emoji prediction task. Since the two
classifiers only differ in that the DeepMoji model has LSTM layers and an attention layer between
the embedding and the Softmax layer, this difference in accuracy demonstrates the importance of
capturing each word’s context.

Benchmarking
We evaluate our method on 3 distinct NLP tasks using 8 datasets across 5 domains. For fair
comparison, DeepMoji is compared to other methods that utilize external data sources in addition
to the benchmark dataset. We used an averaged F1 measure across classes for evaluating emotion
analysis and sarcasm detection, as these consist of unbalanced datasets. Sentiment datasets are
evaluated using accuracy.
4
Many benchmark datasets have an issue with data scarcity, especially in emotion analysis. Many
studies that introduce new methods for emotion analysis often evaluate their performance on a single
benchmark dataset, SemEval 2007 Task 14, which contains only 1250 data points. There has been
criticism regarding the use of correlation with continuous ratings as a measure, making only the
somewhat limited binary evaluation possible. We only evaluate the emotions Fear, Joy, Sadness
because the remaining emotions are found in less than 5
To fully assess our method on emotion analysis, we make use of two other datasets. First, a dataset
of emotions in tweets about the Olympic Games, created by Sintsova et al. which we convert to
a single-label classification task. Second, a dataset of self-reported emotional experiences from a
large group of psychologists. Because these two datasets have not been evaluated in prior work,
we compare against a state-of-the-art approach based on a valence-arousal-dominance framework.
The scores extracted using this framework are mapped to the classes in the datasets using logistic
regression with cross-validation parameter optimization. We have made our preprocessing code
available so that these two datasets may be used for future benchmarking in emotion analysis.
We assessed the performance of sentiment analysis using three benchmark datasets. These small
datasets were chosen to highlight the significance of the transfer learning capabilities of the evaluated
models. Two datasets, SS-Twitter and SS-Youtube, are from SentiStrength and follow the relabeling
as described by prior work to create binary labels. The third dataset is from SemEval 2016 Task4A.
Because tweets are often deleted from Twitter, the SemEval dataset has experienced data decay. This
makes comparisons across papers difficult. Approximately 15
The current state of the art in sentiment analysis on social media (and winner of SemEval 2016 Task
4A) uses an ensemble of convolutional neural networks that are pre-trained on a private dataset of
tweets with emoticons. This makes it difficult to replicate. As a substitute, we pre-train a model that
uses the hyperparameters of the largest model in their ensemble on the positive/negative emoticon
dataset. Using this pretraining as an initialization, we fine-tune the model on the target tasks, utilizing
early stopping based on a validation set. We implemented Sentiment-Specific Word Embeddings
(SSWE), using embeddings available on the authors’ website, but found that it performed worse than
the pretrained convolutional neural network, and these results have been excluded.
Table 4 presents a description of the benchmark datasets. Datasets that did not have pre-existing
training/test splits were split by us, and these splits are publicly available. Data from the training set
was used for hyperparameter tuning.

Table 2: Description of benchmark datasets. Datasets without pre-existing training/test splits are split
by us (with splits publicly available). Data used for hyperparameter tuning is taken from the training
set.
For sarcasm detection, we used versions 1 and 2 of the sarcasm dataset from the Internet Argument
Corpus. It should be noted that the results from these benchmarks that are shown elsewhere are not
directly comparable, as only a subset of the data is available online. We establish a state-of-the-art
baseline by modeling embedding-based features alongside unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams with
an SVM. GoogleNews word2vec embeddings are used to compute the embedding-based features.
Cross-validation was used to perform a hyperparameter search for regularization parameters. The
sarcasm dataset version 2 includes both a quoted text and a sarcastic response, but only the response
was used to keep models consistent across the datasets.

Table 3: Comparison across benchmark datasets. Reported values are averages across five runs.
Variations refer to transfer learning approaches with ‘new’ being a model trained without pretraining.
We used the Adam optimizer for training, with the gradient norm clipped to 1. For training all new
layers, we set the learning rate to 10−3 and to 10−4 when fine-tuning any pre-trained layers. To
prevent overfitting on the small datasets, 10
Table 5 demonstrates that the DeepMoji model outperforms the state of the art across all the benchmark
datasets and that our new ‘chain-thaw’ method yields the highest transfer learning performance. The
results are averaged across 5 runs to reduce the variance. We confirm statistical significance using
bootstrap testing with 10,000 samples, our model performance was statistically better than the
state-of-the-art across all benchmark datasets (p < 0.001).
Our model exceeds the performance of the state of the art even on datasets that come from different
domains than the tweets that the model was pre-trained on. A crucial difference between the
pretraining dataset and the benchmark datasets is the length of the observations. The average number
of tokens per tweet in the pretraining dataset is 11. Meanwhile, board posts from the Internet
Argument Corpus version 1 (for example), have an average of 66 tokens, with some posts being much
longer.

Model Analysis
5.1
Importance of emoji diversity
A key difference between this work and prior research that used distant supervision is the variety in
noisy labels. For example, other studies only used positive and negative emoticons as noisy labels.
Other studies used more nuanced sets of noisy labels, but our set is the most varied known to us. To
investigate the effect of using a diverse set of emojis, we created a subset of our pretraining data that
included tweets with one of 8 emojis, which are similar to the positive/negative emoticons used in
other work. Because the dataset based on this reduced set of emojis contains 433 million tweets, any
performance differences on benchmark datasets are more likely linked to the diversity of the labels
than to differences in dataset sizes.
We trained our DeepMoji model to predict whether tweets contained positive or negative emojis,
and we evaluated this pre-trained model on benchmark datasets. We call this the DeepMoji-PosNeg
model. To assess the emotional representations learned by the two pre-trained models, we used the
‘last’ transfer learning approach to allow the models to map already learned features to classes in the
6
target datasets. Table 6 shows that DeepMoji-PosNeg performs worse than DeepMoji across all 8
benchmarks. This demonstrates that the diversity of our emoji types enables the model to acquire
richer representations of emotional content in text, which in turn is more useful for transfer learning.
Table 6 compares benchmarks using a smaller emoji set (Pos/Neg emojis) or a standard architecture
(standard LSTM). Results for DeepMoji from Table 5 have been added for comparison. The evaluation
metrics are the same as in Table 5. Reported values are averages across 5 runs.

Table 4: Benchmarks using a smaller emoji set (Pos/Neg emojis) or a classic architecture (standard

Table 5. Reported values are the averages across five runs.
Many emojis express similar emotional content, but have subtle variations in usage that our model
can capture. By using hierarchical clustering on the correlation matrix of the DeepMoji model’s
predictions on the test set, we can see that the model captures many expected similarities (Figure 3).
For example, the model groups emojis into broad categories related to negativity, positivity, or love.
It also differentiates within these categories. For example, mapping sad emojis to one subcategory of
negativity, annoyed emojis to another subcategory, and angry emojis to a third.
5.2
Model architecture
Our DeepMoji model architecture employs an attention mechanism and skip connections, which assist
in transferring learned representations to new domains and tasks. Here, we compare the DeepMoji
model architecture to a standard 2-layer LSTM. Both were compared using the ‘last’ transfer learning
approach, and all regularization and training parameters were consistent.
Table 6 shows that the DeepMoji model performs better than a standard 2-layer LSTM across all the
benchmark datasets. These two architectures performed equally on the pretraining task. This indicates
that the DeepMoji model architecture is better for transfer learning, even if it is not necessarily better
for a single supervised classification task with an abundance of available data.
We believe that the improvements in transfer learning can be attributed to two factors: (a) The
attention mechanism with skip connections provides straightforward access to learned low-level
features for any time step, making it easy to use this information if needed for a new task. (b) The skip
connections improve the gradient flow from the output layer to the early layers in the network. This
is useful when parameters in early layers are adjusted as a part of transfer learning to small datasets.
Further analysis of these factors in future work would allow us to confirm why our architecture
outperforms a standard 2-layer LSTM.
5.3
Analyzing the effect of pretraining
The target task’s performance benefits significantly from pretraining, as shown in Table 5. Here,
we separate the effects of pretraining into two factors: word coverage and phrase coverage. These
two effects provide regularization to the model, preventing overfitting (the supplementary material
includes a visualization of this regularization).
There are multiple ways of expressing sentiment, emotion, or sarcasm. Because of this, the test set
may contain language use not present in the training set. Pretraining helps the target task models
focus on low-support evidence by having already seen similar language in the pretraining dataset.
To examine this effect, we measure the improvement in word coverage on the test set when using
7
pretraining. Word coverage is defined as the percentage of words in the test dataset that were also
seen in the training/pretraining dataset (as shown in Table 7). One key reason that the ‘chain-thaw’
approach outperforms other transfer learning approaches is its ability to tune the embedding layer
with a low risk of overfitting. Table 7 shows how adding new words to the vocabulary as part of the
tuning process increased word coverage.
It is important to note that word coverage can be misleading in this context. In many small datasets, a
word may occur only once in the training set. In contrast, all the words in the pretraining vocabulary
are present in thousands or even millions of observations, enabling the model to learn a good
representation of the emotional and semantic meaning. Therefore, the benefits of pretraining for word
representations likely extend beyond the differences seen in Table 7.
Table 7 shows the word coverage on benchmark test sets. This compares the use of only the vocabulary
generated by finding words in the training data (‘own’), the pretraining vocabulary (‘last’), or a
combination of both vocabularies (‘full / chain-thaw’).

To analyze how important capturing phrases and the context of each word are, we evaluated the
accuracy on the SS-Youtube dataset using a fastText classifier that was pre-trained using the same
emoji dataset as our DeepMoji model. This fastText classifier is similar to only using the embedding
layer from the DeepMoji model. We then evaluated the representations learned by fine-tuning the
models as feature extractors (using the ‘last’ transfer learning approach). The fastText model achieved
an accuracy of 63

Comparing with human-level agreement
To see how well our DeepMoji classifier performs compared to humans, we created a dataset of
randomly selected tweets that were annotated for sentiment. Each tweet was annotated by a minimum
of 10 English-speaking Amazon Mechanical Turkers (MTurks) who lived in the USA. The tweets
were rated on a scale from 1 to 9, with a ‘Do not know’ option. Guidelines were provided to the
human raters. The tweets were selected to contain only English text and no mentions or URLs, so
they could be rated without extra contextual information. Tweets where more than half the evaluators
chose ‘Do not know’ were removed (98 tweets).
For every tweet, we randomly select a single MTurk rating as the ‘human evaluation.’ We average the
remaining nine MTurk ratings to make the ground truth. The ‘sentiment label’ for a given tweet is thus
defined as the overall consensus among raters, excluding the randomly selected ‘human evaluation’
rating. To ensure clear separation between the label categories, we removed neutral tweets that fell
within the interval [4.5, 5.5] (roughly 29

Conclusion
We have demonstrated how the abundance of text on social media containing emojis can be used
to pre-train models. This enables them to acquire representations of emotional content in text. Our
findings demonstrate that the diversity of our emoji set is crucial to our method’s performance. This
was found by comparing the model performance against an identical model that was pre-trained on a
subset of emojis. Our pre-trained DeepMoji model is available for other researchers to use for diverse
emotion-related NLP tasks.

Abstract
The intricacies of system design intersect with the existential implications of
quantum cheese, which in turn, influences the aerodynamic properties of flamingos,
and conversely, the abstract notion of colorless green ideas sleeping furiously, while
the ontological status of furniture arrangements in Scandinavian apartments remains
an enigma, alongside the theoretical frameworks governing the migration patterns
of narwhals and the surreptitious culinary habits of extraterrestrial beings, all of
which converge to form a holistic understanding of the synergistic relationships
between disparate entities, transcending the boundaries of reality and fantasy, in a
realm where the cartography of lost socks and the topological analysis of coffee
creamer dispensers serve as metaphors for the human condition, and ultimately, the
search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, through the deconstruction
of postmodernist narratives and the reconceptualization of temporal flows in relation
to the viscosity of ketchup and the sonorous qualities of whispers in a vacuum.
1
Introduction
The aforementioned paradigm shift necessitates a reevaluation of the role of system design in
facilitating the emergence of complex systems, which in turn, gives rise to a plethora of unforeseen
consequences, including the spontaneous generation of miniature black holes in toaster ovens, the
precipitous decline of disco music as a viable form of artistic expression, and the concomitant rise
of cryptid sightings in suburban areas, all of which underscore the imperative of adopting a more
nuanced and interdisciplinary approach to system design, one that accommodates the labyrinthine
intricacies of human perception, the vicissitudes of celestial mechanics, and the ephemeral nature
of digital ephemera, in a quest to distill the essence of reality from the cacophony of competing
narratives and the ambiguities of existential dread, thereby illuminating the path towards a more
enlightened and harmonious coexistence with the universe, or at the very least, a more efficient
method for organizing kitchen utensils.
The dialectical tension between the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of system design serves as a
catalyst for the emergence of novel solutions, which in turn, are influenced by the hermeneutics of
pastry decoration, the semiotics of traffic patterns, and the mystical properties of forgotten umbrellas,
all of which converge to form a rich tapestry of meaning, replete with hidden patterns and unforeseen
consequences, waiting to be deciphered by intrepid researchers and visionary thinkers, who are
willing to challenge the status quo, push the boundaries of conventional wisdom, and venture into
the uncharted territories of the unknown, in pursuit of a deeper understanding of the intricate web of
relationships that underlies the complex systems that govern our world, and perhaps, just perhaps,
uncover the hidden secrets of the universe, or at the very least, develop a more efficient algorithm for
folding fitted sheets.
The synthesis of these disparate threads of inquiry and exploration gives rise to a novel paradigm for
system design, one that is grounded in the principles of ontological humility, epistemological curiosity,
and methodological pluralism, and which seeks to reconcile the competing demands of functionality,
aesthetics, and sustainability, in a quest to create systems that are not only efficient and effective
but also beautiful, just, and sustainable, and which ultimately, contribute to the betterment of the
human condition, or at the very least, provide a more satisfactory explanation for the disappearance
of missing socks, and the concomitant rise of mysterious stains on otherwise pristine carpets, in a
world where the surreal and the mundane coexist in a delicate balance of wonder and bewilderment.
The efficacy of system design is intricately linked to the migratory patterns of sparrows, which in
turn have a profound impact on the development of fractal theory, a concept that has been largely
overlooked in the realm of culinary arts, particularly in the preparation of soufflés, which require a
deep understanding of thermodynamics and the behavior of gases under varying conditions of pressure
and temperature, much like the intricate dance of subatomic particles in a high-energy collision,
where the principles of quantum mechanics are juxtaposed with the art of playing the harmonica, an
instrument that has been known to induce a state of trance in certain species of dolphins, who are
themselves capable of communicating through complex patterns of clicks and whistles, a language
that has been studied extensively in the field of exolinguistics, a discipline that seeks to understand the
potential for language development on distant planets, where the atmosphere is composed of a unique
blend of gases, including helium and neon, which are also used in the production of fluorescent
lighting, a technology that has revolutionized the field of interior design, particularly in the creation of
ambiance for minimalist furniture, which is often crafted from sustainable materials, such as bamboo
and recycled plastic, both of which have a significant impact on the global ecosystem, particularly
in the context of climate change, a phenomenon that is closely tied to the orbit of the planet Jupiter,
whose massive size and gravitational pull have a profound effect on the Earth’s tides, which in turn

Experiments
In an effort to optimize the flux capacitor, our research team inadvertently stumbled upon a hidden
pattern in the migration patterns of Canadian geese, which, as it turns out, have a direct correlation
with the efficacy of system design protocols. This led us to re-evaluate our approach and consider the
aerodynamic properties of various types of cheese, specifically gouda and mozzarella, in relation to
the structural integrity of modular software frameworks. The results, though unexpected, pointed to a
significant improvement in system performance when the software was designed with a mozzarella-
inspired framework, as opposed to the traditional gouda-based approach. Furthermore, our analysis
revealed that the optimal system design configuration would involve a synergistic combination of
mozzarella and the principles of quantum entanglement, which, surprisingly, have a direct impact on
the scalability of cloud-based infrastructure.
Moreover, our experiments involved a series of intricate dance moves, including the tango and the
waltz, which were used to simulate the complex interactions between system components. This
unorthodox approach allowed us to identify previously unknown patterns and relationships between
the various system elements, ultimately leading to a more holistic understanding of system design.
The application of dance theory to system design also enabled us to develop a novel methodology for
evaluating system performance, which we have termed ""choreographic analysis."" This innovative
approach has far-reaching implications for the field of system design and is expected to revolutionize
the way we think about complex systems.
In addition to the dance-based experiments, we also conducted a series of tests on the effects of
different types of music on system performance. Our results showed that systems designed to the
rhythm of jazz music exhibit significantly higher levels of adaptability and resilience compared to
those designed to the rhythm of classical music. This finding has significant implications for the
development of future system design frameworks, as it suggests that the incorporation of jazz-inspired
8
principles could lead to more robust and flexible systems. The exact mechanisms by which jazz
music influences system design are still not fully understood, but our research suggests that it may be
related to the inherent complexity and unpredictability of jazz rhythms.
To further explore the relationship between music and system design, we created a series of musical
compositions specifically designed to enhance system performance. These compositions, which we
have termed ""system sonatas,"" were created using a combination of traditional musical instruments
and cutting-edge audio processing techniques. The results of our experiments showed that systems
designed to the rhythm of these system sonatas exhibit improved levels of efficiency and productivity,
particularly in situations where the system is subjected to high levels of stress or uncertainty. The

resilience, and efficiency, and provides a comprehensive evaluation of system performance. The
development of the systemic efficacy metric has significant implications for the field of system design,
as it provides a novel and innovative approach to evaluating system performance.
The application of the systemic efficacy metric to real-world systems has yielded some surprising re-
sults. For example, our analysis of a complex financial system revealed that the system’s performance
was being hindered by a previously unknown pattern of interactions between system components.
The identification and mitigation of this pattern using the systemic efficacy metric led to a significant
improvement in system performance, and the system is now operating at optimal levels. This success
story demonstrates the potential of the systemic efficacy metric to transform the field of system design
and has significant implications for the development of future system design frameworks.
In an effort to further understand the complex interactions between system components, we turned to
the field of astronomy and the study of celestial mechanics. The orbits of planets and stars can be
likened to the complex patterns of interaction between system components, and the application of
celestial mechanics to system design can lead to a deeper understanding of system behavior. Our
research has shown that the principles of celestial mechanics can be used to predict and optimize
system performance, particularly in situations where the system is subjected to high levels of stress
or uncertainty. The development of celestial mechanics-inspired system design frameworks has
the potential to revolutionize the field of system design and has significant implications for the
development of future system design frameworks.
To illustrate the application of celestial mechanics to system design, we created a series of complex
mathematical models that simulate the interactions between system components. These models,
which we have termed ""systemic astrodynamics,"" take into account a wide range of factors, including
system adaptability, resilience, and efficiency, and provide a comprehensive evaluation of system
performance. The development of systemic astrodynamics has significant implications for the field of
system design, as it provides a novel and innovative approach to evaluating system performance.

future urban environments.
In conclusion, our research has shown that the field of system design is far more complex and
multifaceted than previously thought. The application of principles from fields such as dance,
music, and celestial mechanics can lead to significant improvements in system performance, and
the development of novel frameworks and methodologies can transform the field of system design.

P014.pdf,"Advancements in Audio-Visual Active Speaker
Detection: A Novel Approach for the ActivityNet
Challenge
Abstract
This document outlines our contribution to the ActivityNet Challenge, focusing on
active speaker detection. We employ a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)
for feature extraction, combined with an ensemble of temporal convolution and
LSTM classifiers to determine whether a person who is visible is also speaking.
The results demonstrate substantial improvements compared to the established
baseline on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset.
1
Introduction
The field of multimodal speech perception has garnered significant attention in recent times, with
major advancements in audio-visual methodologies facilitated by deep learning. The capacity to
identify which individuals are speaking at any moment is crucial for a variety of applications. The
introduction of the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset has been a significant development, allowing for the
training of deep-learning-based active speaker detection (ASD) models with complete supervision.
This document provides a concise analysis of this dataset and elaborates on the methodology behind
our submission to the challenge.
1.1
Datasets
The model is developed using the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset, which is divided into training, valida-
tion, and test sets, as detailed in Table 1. The ground truth labels are available for the training and
validation sets.

This dataset presents several challenges. The durations of speaking segments are notably brief, with
an average of 1.11 seconds for segments that are both spoken and audible. Consequently, the system
needs to deliver precise detection with a limited number of frames. Traditional methods, which
depend on smoothing the output over a time window of several seconds, are not effective under these
conditions.
Additionally, the dataset includes many older videos where the audio and video recordings appear to
have been captured separately or are significantly out of sync. As a result, the temporal alignment
between audio and visual speech representations is not a reliable indicator of a person’s speaking
status.
.
2
Methodology
The active speaker detection system is composed of two primary components: front-end feature
extractors and a back-end classifier, each discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.
2.1
Front-end architecture
For the extraction of audio and video representations, pre-trained networks are employed. These
encoder networks have undergone training for the audio-visual correspondence task through a self-
supervised approach on unlabeled videos.
The video encoder utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), processing 5 RGB image frames
to produce a 512-dimensional representation. The architecture draws inspiration from the VGG-M
network, known for its compactness and efficiency, but incorporates a 3D convolution in the initial
layer instead of the conventional 2D convolution.
The audio encoder receives an input comprising 20 frames in the temporal dimension and 13 cepstral
coefficients in the other, generating a 512-dimensional representation that aligns with the video
representation’s embedding space.
2.2
Back-end architecture
Both the audio and video encoders process an input of 5 video frames (equivalent to 0.2 seconds),
advancing 1 video frame (0.04 seconds) at a time. Consequently, for an input of T frames, the output
dimensions are 512 x (T - 4). In this study, two straightforward back-end classifiers are evaluated.
Although our experiments utilize T = 9, no significant performance variations were noted for T values
within the range of 7 to 15.
LSTM classifier. The audio and video representations are channeled into two distinct bi-directional
LSTM networks, each comprising 2 layers with a hidden size of 128. The outputs from these networks
are merged and subsequently processed through a linear classification layer. This layer determines
whether the individual is speaking, and it is trained using the softmax cross-entropy loss.
TC classifier. In place of LSTM layers, the encoder outputs are directed to two temporal convolution
layers, each equipped with 128 filters. The outputs are similarly concatenated and forwarded to the
classifier, mirroring the approach used with the LSTM classifier.
Ensemble. Ensemble methods in machine learning have been demonstrated to frequently surpass
the performance of any individual classifier. In this approach, the predictions generated by both the
LSTM and TC classifiers are averaged with equal weighting to produce the final prediction.
Smoothing. To mitigate noise within the predictions, the outputs of the classifiers undergo temporal
smoothing using either a median or Wiener filter, both applied over 0.5-second intervals.
3
Experiments
Our model, implemented using the PyTorch library, was trained on a single Tesla M40 card with
24GB of memory. Training utilized the ADAM optimizer with default settings and a fixed learning
rate of 10-2. To counteract any bias in the training data, the number of samples for positive and
negative classes was balanced within each mini-batch during the training process.
The evaluation metric for this task is the mean Average Precision (mAP), with the evaluation code
supplied by the challenge organizers.
Results on the validation set for the various back-end classifiers are presented in Table 2. The best
model achieved an mAP of 0.878 on the sequestered test set for the challenge. In contrast, the
GRU-based baseline model yielded an mAP of 0.821.
The qualitative outcomes of the proposed method significantly surpass those of existing
correspondence-based methods on this dataset because it does not depend on accurate audio-to-
video synchronization.

P093.pdf,"Premature Termination Strategy for Deep Image Prior
Abstract
Deep Image Prior (DIP) and its variations have demonstrated significant promise in addressing inverse problems in
computational imaging, without the need for separate training data. Often, practical DIP models are significantly
overparameterized. These models initially capture the intended visual content during the learning phase and
subsequently incorporate potential modeling and observational noise, demonstrating a pattern of initial learning
followed by overfitting (ELTO). Consequently, the practical application of DIP depends on an early stopping (ES)
mechanism capable of identifying this transitional period. Most previous DIP research in computational imaging
has focused on demonstrating the models’ potential by reporting peak performance against ground truth, without
providing practical methods to achieve near-peak performance without access to ground truth. This paper aims to
overcome this practical limitation of DIP by introducing an efficient ES strategy that reliably identifies near-peak
performance across various computational imaging tasks and DIP variants. This ES method, based on the running
variance of intermediate reconstructions in DIP, not only surpasses existing methods that are limited to specific
conditions but also maintains its effectiveness when combined with techniques aimed at reducing overfitting.
1
Introduction
Inverse problems (IPs) are widespread in the field of computational imaging, encompassing tasks from fundamental image denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring to complex 3D reconstruction and significant challenges in scientific and medical imaging. Despite
the variety of settings, all these problems involve recovering a visual object x from an observation y = f(x), where f represents the
forward physical process. Usually, these visual IPs are underdetermined, meaning x cannot be uniquely ascertained from y. This
ambiguity is further complicated by potential modeling inaccuracies (such as using a linear f to approximate a nonlinear process)
and observational noise (like Gaussian or shot noise), represented as y ˘2248 f(x). To address nonuniqueness and enhance stability
against noise, researchers often integrate a range of problem-specific priors on x when formulating IPs.
2
Related Work
There are three primary methods to counteract the overfitting of DIP models. The first one is Regularization: Overfitting is lessened
by limiting the size of G˘03b8 to the underparameterization range. Layer-wise weights or the network Jacobian are regularized to
regulate the network capacity. The total-variation norm or trained denoisers are used as additional regularizers R(G˘03b8(z)). To
prevent overfitting, these techniques need the proper amount of regularization, which varies depending on the kind and degree of
noise. They may nevertheless cause overfitting if the regularization level is incorrect. Furthermore, even when they are successful,
the performance peak is delayed until the last few iterations, which frequently increases the computing cost by several times. The
second method is Noise modeling: In their optimization objective, sparse additive noise is explicitly represented. Regularizers and
ES criteria are created especially for Gaussian and shot noise. Subgradient techniques using decreasing step size schedules are
being investigated for impulse noise with the ˘21131 loss, and they have shown some early promise. These techniques are ineffective
outside of the noise types and levels that they are designed to address, and our understanding of the noise in a particular visual
IP is often constrained. The third method is Early stopping (ES): Progress is tracked using a ratio of no-reference blurriness and
sharpness, however, as the authors point out, the criterion is only applicable to their modified DIP models. It is unclear how to apply
the noise-specific regularizer and ES criterion to unknown noise types and levels. It is suggested to monitor DIP reconstruction by
training a coupled autoencoder. Although it performs similarly to ours, the additional autoencoder training significantly increases the
overall processing time. By dividing the elements of y into ""training"" and ""validation"" sets, it is possible to simulate validation-based
ES in supervised learning. However, in IPs, particularly nonlinear ones (such as blind image deblurring (BID), where y ˘2248 k
˘2217 x and ˘2217 denotes linear convolution), elements of y may not be i.i.d., which could impair the effectiveness of validation.
Furthermore, withholding a portion of the observation in y can significantly diminish peak performance.
3
Methodology
We advocate for the ES approach because, even when effective, regularization and noise modeling techniques frequently fail to
enhance peak performance; instead, they extend it to the final iterations, potentially requiring ten times more iterations than would be
necessary to reach the peak in the original DIP models. Furthermore, both approaches necessitate extensive knowledge of the noise
type and level, which is often unavailable for most applications. If their essential models and hyperparameters are not appropriately
configured, overfitting is likely to persist, and ES will still be necessary. This paper introduces a novel ES criterion applicable to
various DIP models, based on monitoring the trend of the running variance in the reconstruction sequence.
Detecting transition by running variance:
Our lightweight method only involves computing the VAR curve and numerically detecting its valley˘2014 the iteration stops once the
valley is detected. To obtain the curve, we set a window size parame- ter W and compute the windowed moving variance (WMV). To
robustly detect the valley, we introduce a patience number P to tolerate up to P consecutive steps of variance stagnation. Obviously,
the cost is dominated by the calculation of variance per step, which is O(W N ) (N is the size of the visual object). In comparison, a
typical gradient update step for solving Eq. (2) costs at least ˘2126(|˘03b8|N ), where |˘03b8| is the number of parameters in the DNN
G˘03b8. Since |˘03b8| is typically much larger than W (default: 100), our running VAR and detection incur very little compu- tational
overhead.
4
Experiments
ES-WMV is tested for DIP in a variety of linear and nonlinear IPs, including image denoising, inpainting, demosaicing, super-
resolution, MRI reconstruction, and blind image deblurring. ES-WMV is also systematically assessed for major DIP variants, such
as deep decoder, DIP-TV, and GP-DIP, for image denoising. It is shown to be a dependable helper in identifying effective ES
points. The specifics of the DIP variants are covered in Appendix A.5. In addition, ES-WMV is contrasted with the primary rival
techniques, such as DF-STE, SV-ES, DOP, SB, and VAL. The specifics of the primary ES-based techniques are found in Appendix
A.6. Reconstruction quality is evaluated using both PSNR and SSIM, and detection performance is shown using PSNR and SSIM
gaps, which are the differences between our detected and peak values.
4.1
Image Denoising
The majority of earlier research on DIP overfitting has concentrated on image denoising and often assessed their techniques using
only one or two forms of noise with modest noise levels, such as low-level Gaussian noise. We use the traditional 9-image dataset
for each noise type, and we create two noise levels˘2014low and high˘2014for each.

˘2113(˘03b8) F , where G˘03b8 is a trainable DNN parameterized by ˘03b8 and z is a frozen random seed. Then we conduct experiments
for 2˘00d7 super- resolution with low-level Gaussian and impulse noise. We test our ES-WMV for DIP and a state-of-the-art zero-shot
method based on pre-trained diffusion model˘2014DDNM+ on the standard super-resolution dataset Set14, as shown in Tab. 5, Fig.
11, and Appendix A.7.9. We note that DDNM+ relies on pre-trained models from large external training datasets, while DIP does
not. We observe that (1) Our ES-WMV is again able to detect near-peak performance for most images: the average PSNR gap is
˘2264 1.50 and the average SSIM gap is ˘2264 0.07; (2) DDNM+ is sensitive to the noise type and level: from Tab. 5, DDNM+ trained
assuming Gaussian noise level ˘03c3y = 0.12 outperforms DIP and DIP+ES-WMV when there is Gaus- sian measurement noise at
the level ˘03c3y = 0.12, which is unrealistic in practice, as the noise level is often unknown beforehand. When the noise level is not
set correctly, e.g., as ˘03c3y = 0 in the DDNM+ (˘03c3y = .00) row of Tab. 5, the performance of DDNM+ is much worse than that of
DIP and DIP+ES-WMV. Also, for super-resolution with impulse noise, DIP is also a clear winner that leads DDNM+ by a large
margin; and (3) in Appendix A.8, we show that DDNM+ may also suffer from the overfitting issue.
4.3
MRI Reconstruction
We also test ES-WMV on MRI reconstruction, a typical linear IP with a nontrivial forward mapping: y ˘2248 F(x), where F is the
subsampled Fourier operator, and we use ˘2248 to indicate that the noise encountered in practical MRI imaging may be hybrid (e.g.,
additive, shot) and uncertain. Here, we take the 8-fold undersampling and parameterize x using ˘201cConv-Decoder˘201d, a variant of
deep decoder. Due to the heavy over-parameterization, overfitting occurs and ES is needed.

4.4
Blind Image Deblurring
In BID, a blurry and noisy image is given, and the goal is to recover a sharp and clean image. The blur is mostly caused by motion
and/or op- tical non-ideality in the camera, and the forward process is often modeled as y = k ˘2217 x + n, where k is the blur
kernel, n models additive sensory noise, and ˘2217 is linear convolution to model the spa- tial uniformity of the blur effect. BID
is a very challenging visual IP due to bilin- earity: (k, x) 7˘2192 k ˘2217 x. Recently, researchers have tried to use DIP models to
solve BID by modeling k and x as two separate DNNs, i.e., min˘03b8k,˘03b8x ˘2225y ˘2212 G˘03b8k (zk) ˘2217 G˘03b8x(zx)˘22252 2 +
˘03bb˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22251/˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22252, where the regular- izer is to promote sparsity in the gradient domain
for the reconstruction of x, as stan- dard in BID. We follow previous work and choose a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with softmax
activation for G˘03b8k , and the canonical DIP model (CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture) for G˘03b8x(zx). We change their
regularizer from the original ˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22251 to the current, as their original formulation is tested only at a very low
noise level ˘03c3 = 10˘22125 and no overfitting is observed. We set the test with a higher noise level ˘03c3 = 10˘22123, and find that its
original formulation does not work.

Conclusion
This paper introduces an innovative ES detection approach, ES-WMV, along with its variant, ES-EMV, which has demonstrated
robust performance across a range of visual IPs and different DIP variations. In contrast to most competing ES methods that are
specific to certain types of noise or DIP models and have limited applicability, our method exhibits broad effectiveness. While
there is a method with comparable performance, it significantly increases processing time. Another method, validation-based ES,
performs well in simple denoising tasks but falls short in more complex nonlinear IPs like BID.

P087.pdf,"Subspace Constraint Method of Feature Tracking
Abstract
Feature tracking in video is a crucial task in computer vision. Usually, the tracking
problem is handled one feature at a time, using a single-feature tracker like the
Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm, or one of its derivatives. While this approach
works quite well when dealing with high- quality video and “strong” features, it
often falters when faced with dark and noisy video containing low-quality features.
We present a framework for jointly tracking a set of features, which enables sharing
information between the different features in the scene. We show that our method
can be employed to track features for both rigid and non- rigid motions (possibly
of few moving bodies) even when some features are occluded. Furthermore, it can
be used to significantly improve tracking results in poorly-lit scenes (where there
is a mix of good and bad features). Our approach does not require direct modeling
of the structure or the motion of the scene, and runs in real time on a single CPU
core.
1
Introduction
Feature tracking in video is an important computer vision task, often used as the first step in finding
structure from motion or simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM). The celebrated Kanade-Lucas-
Tomasi algorithm tracks feature points by searching for matches between templates representing
each feature and a frame of video. Despite many other alternatives and improvement, it is still one
of the best video feature tracking algorithms. However, there are several realistic scenarios when
Lucas-Kanade and many of its alternatives do not perform well: poor lighting conditions, noisy video,
and when there are transient occlusions that need to be ignored. In order to deal with such scenarios
more robustly it would be useful to allow the feature points to communicate with each other to decide
how they should move as a group, so as to respect the underlying three dimensional geometry of the
scene.
This underlying geometry constrains the trajectories of the track points to have a low-rank structure
for the case when tracking a single rigid object under an affine camera model, and for non-rigid
motion and the perspective camera. In this work we will combine the low-rank geometry of the
cohort of tracked features with the successful non-linear single feature tracking framework of Lucas
and Kanade by adding a low-rank regularization penalty in the tracking optimization problem. To
accommodate dynamic scenes with non-trivial motion we apply our rank constraint over a sliding
window, so that we only consider a small number of frames at a given time (this is a common idea
for dealing with non-rigid motions). We demonstrate very strong performance in rigid environments
as well as in scenes with multiple and/or non- rigid motion (since the trajectories of all features are
still low rank for short time intervals). We describe experiments with several choices of low-rank
regularizers (which are local in time), using a unified optimization framework that allows real time
regularized tracking on a single CPU core.
2
On Low-Rank Feature Trajectories
Under the affine camera model, the feature trajectories for a set of features from a rigid body should
exist in an affine subspace of dimension 3, or a linear subspace of dimension 4. However, subspaces
.
corresponding to very degenerate motion are lower-dimensional those corresponding to general
motion.
Feature trajectories of non-rigid scenarios exhibit significant variety, but some low-rank models
may still be successfully applied to them. we consider a sliding temporal window, where over
short durations the motion is simple and the feature trajectories are of lower rank. The restriction
on the length of feature trajectories can also help in satisfying an approximate local affine camera
model in scenes which violate the affine camera model. In general, depth disparities give rise to
low-dimensional manifolds which are only locally approximated by linear spaces.
At last, even in the case of multiple moving rigid objects, the set of trajectories is still low rank
(confined to the union of a few low rank subspaces). In all of these scenarios the low rank is unknown
in general.

Feature Tracking
Notation: A feature at a location z1 ∈R2 in a given N1 × N2 frame of an N1 × N2 × N3 video is
characterized by a template T, which is an n × n sub-image of that frame centered at z1 (n is a small
integer, generally taken to be odd, so the template has a center pixel). If z1 does not have integer
coordinates, T is interpolated from the image. We denote Ω= 1, ..., n × 1, ..., n and we parametrize T
so that its pixel values are obtained by T(u)u∈Ω.
A classical formulation of the single-feature tracking problem is to search for the translation x1 that
minimizes some distance between a feature’s template T at a given frame and the next frame of video
translated by x1; we denote this next frame by I. That is, we minimize the single-feature energy
function c(x1):
c(x1) = 1
2
X
u∈Ω
ψ(T(u) −I(u + x1))
where, for example, ψ(x) = |x| or ψ(x) = x2. To apply continuous optimization we view x1 as a
continuous variable and we thus view T and I as functions over continuous domains (implemented
with bi-linear interpolation).
3.1
Low Rank Regularization Framework
If we want to encourage a low rank structure in the trajectories, we cannot view the tracking of
different features as separate problems. For f ∈1, 2, ..., F, let xf denote the position of feature f in
the current frame (in image coordinates), and let x = (x1, x2, ..., xF ) ∈R2F denote the joint state of
all features in the scene. We define the total energy function as follows:
C(x) =
1
Fn2
F
X
f=1
X
u∈Ω
ψ(Tf(u) −I(u + xf))
where Tf(u) is the template for feature f. Now, we can impose desired relationships between features
in a scene by imposing constraints on the domain of optimization.
Instead of enforcing a hard constraint, we add a penalty term to, which increases the cost of states
which are inconsistent with low-rank motion. Specifically, we define:
C(x) = α
F
X
f=1
X
u∈Ω
ψ(Tf(u) −I(u + xf)) + P(x)
where P(x) is an estimate of, or proxy for, the dimensionality of the set of feature trajectories over the
last several frames of video (past feature locations are treated as constants, so this is a function only
of the current state, x). Notice that we have replaced the scale factor 1/(Fn2) from with the constant
α, as this coefficient is now also responsible for controlling the relative strength of the penalty term.
We will give explicit examples for P in section 3.2.
This framework gives rise to two different solutions, characterized by the strength of the penalty
term (definition of α). Each has useful, real-world tracking applications. In the first case, we assume
2
that most (but not necessarily all) features in the scene approximately obey a low rank model. This
is appropriate if the scene contains non-rigid or multiple moving bodies. We can impose a weak
constraint by making the penalty term small relative to the other terms. If a feature is strong, it will
confidently track the imagery, ignoring the constraint (regardless of whether the motion is consistent
with the other features in the scene). If a feature is weak in the sense that we cannot fully determine
its true location by only looking at the imagery, then the penalty term will become significant and
encourage the feature to agree with the motion of the other features in the scene.
In the second case, we assume that all features in the scene are supposed to agree with a low rank
model (and deviations from that model are indicative of tracking errors). We can impose a strong
constraint by making the penalty term large relative to the other terms. No small set of features can
overpower the constraint, regardless of how strong the features are. This forces all features to move is
a way that is consistent with a simple motion. Thus, a small number of features can even be occluded,
and their positions will be predicted by the motion of the other features in the scene.
3.2
Specific Choices of the Low-Rank Regularizer
There is now a large body of work on low rank regularization. We will restrict ourselves to showing
results using three choices for P described below. Each choice we present defines P(x) in terms
of a matrix M. It is the 2(L + 1) × F matrix whose column f contains the feature trajectory for
feature f within a sliding window of L + 1 consecutive frames (current frame and L past frames).
Specifically, M = [mi,j], where (m0,f , m1,f)T is the current (variable) position of feature f and
(m2l+1,f , m2l+2,f)T , l = 1, ..., L contains the x and y pixel coordinates of feature f from l frames
in the past (past feature locations are treated as known constants). One may alternatively center the
columns of M by subtracting from each column the average of all columns. Most constraints derived
for trajectories actually confine trajectories to a low rank affine subspace (as opposed to a linear
subspace). Centering the columns of M transforms an affine constraint into a linear one. Alternatively,
one can forgo centering and view an affine constraint as a linear constraint in one dimension higher.
We report results for both approaches.
3.2.1
Explicit Factorizations
A simple method for enforcing the structure constraint is to write M = BC, where B is a 2(L+1)×d
matrix, and C is a d × F matrix. However, as mentioned in the previous section, because the feature
tracks often do not lie exactly on a subspace due to deviations from the camera model or non- rigidity,
an explicit constraint of this form is not suitable.
However, an explicit factorization can be used in a penalty term by measuring the deviation of M, in
some norm, from its approximate low rank factorization. For example, if we let
M = UΣV T
denote the SVD of M, we can take P(x) to be ||BC M||, where B is the first three or four columns of U,
and C is the first three or four rows of V T . Then this P corresponds to penalizing M via PF
i=d+1 σi,
where σi = λii is the ith singular value of M. As above, since the history is fixed, U, Σ, and V T are
functions of x.
This approach assumes knowledge of the low-rank d. For simplicity, we assume a local rigid model
and thus set d = 3 when centering M and d = 4 when not centering.
3.2.2
Nuclear Norm
A popular alternative to explicitly keeping track of the best fit low-dimensional subspace to M is to
use the matrix nuclear norm and define
P(x) = ||M||∗= ||σ||1
This is a convex proxy for the rank of M. Here σ = (σ1 σ2 . . . σ2(L+1)∧F )T is the vector of singular
values of M, and || · ||1 is the l1 norm. Unlike explicit factorization, where only energy outside the first
d principal components of M is punished, the nuclear norm will favor lower-rank M over higher-rank
M even when both matrices have rank d. Thus, using this kind of penalty will favor simpler track
point motions over more complex ones, even when both are technically permissible.

3.2.3
Empirical Dimension
Empirical Dimension refers to a class of dimension estimators depending on a parameter ϵ ∈(0,1].
The empirical dimension of M is defined to be:
dϵ(M) = ||σ||ϵ
1
||σ||ϵϵ
Notice that we use norm notation, although || · ||ϵ is only a pseudo-norm. When ϵ = 1, this is sometimes
called the “effective rank” of the data matrix.
Empirical dimension satisfies a few important properties. First, empirical dimension is invariant
under rotation and scaling of a data set. Additionally, in the absence of noise, empirical dimension
never exceeds true dimension, but it approaches true dimension as the number of measurements goes
to infinity for spherically symmetric distributions. Thus, dϵ is a true dimension estimator (whereas
the nuclear norm is a proxy for dimension). To use empirical dimension as our regularizer, we define
P(x) = dϵ(M).
Empirical dimension is governed by its parameter, ϵ. An ϵ near 0 results in a “strict” estimator, which
is appropriate for estimating dimension in situations where you have little noise and you expect your
data to live in true linear spaces. If ϵ is near 1 then dϵ is a lenient estimator. This makes it less
sensitive to noise, and more tolerant of data sets that are only approximately linear. In all of the
experiments we present, we use ϵ = 0.6, although we found that other tested values also worked well.
3.3
Implementation Details
We fix L = 10 for the sliding window and let (x) = |x|. We use this form for so that all terms in the total
energy function behave linearly in a known range of values. If our fit terms behaved quadratically,
it would be more challenging to balance them against a penalty term. We also tested a Huber loss
function for and have concluded that such a regularization is not needed.
We fix a parameter m for each penalty form (selected empirically - see the supplementary material
for our procedure), which determines the strength of the penalty. The weak and strong regularization
parameters are set as follows:
αweak =
1
mn2 and αstrong =
1
mFn2
The weak scaling implies that a perfectly-matched feature will contribute 0 to the total energy, and a
poorly-matched feature will contribute an amount on the order of 1/m to the total energy. The penalty
term will contribute on the order of 1 to the total energy. Since we do not divide the contributions of
each feature by the number of features, the penalty terms contribution is comparable in magnitude to
that of a single feature. The strong scaling implies that the penalty term is on the same scale as the
sum of the contributions of all of the features in the scene.
3.3.1
Minimization Strategy
The total energy function we propose for constrained tracking is non-convex since the contributions
from the template fit terms are not convex (even if P is convex); this is also the case with other feature
tracking methods, including the Lucas-Kanade tracker. We employ a 1st-order descent approach for
driving the energy to a local minimum.
To reduce the computational load of feature tracking, some trackers use 2nd-order methods for
optimization. This works well when tracking strong features, but in our experience it can be
unreliable when dealing with weak or ambiguous features. Since we are explicitly trying to improve
tracking accuracy on poor features we opt for a 1st-order descent approach instead.
The simplest 1st-order descent method is (sub)gradient descent. Unfortunately, because there can be
a very large difference in magnitude between the contributions of strong and weak features to our
total energy, our problem is not well-conditioned. If we pursue standard gradient descent, the strong
features dictate the step direction and the weak features have very little effect on it. Ideally, once the
strong features are correctly positioned, they will no longer dominate the step direction. If we were
able to perfectly measure the gradient of our objective function, this would be the case. In practice,
the error in our numerical gradient estimate can be large enough to prevent the strong features from
4
ever relinquishing control over the step direction. The result is that in a scene with both very strong
and very weak features, the weak features may not be tracked.
To remedy this, we compute our step direction by blending the gradient of the energy function with a
vector that corresponds to taking equal-sized gradient descent steps separately for each feature. We
use a fast line search in each iteration to find the nearest local minimum in the step direction. This
compromise approach allows for efficient descent while ensuring that each feature has some control
over the step direction (regardless of feature strength).
Because the energy is not convex, it is important to choose a good initial state. We use a combination
of two strategies to initialize the tracking: first, we generate our initial guess of x by registering an
entire frame of video with the previous (at lower resolution). Secondly, we use multi-resolution, or
pyramidal tracking so that approximate motion on a large scale can help us get close to the minimum
before we try tracking on finer resolution levels.
We now explain the details of the algorithm. Let I denote a full new frame of video and let xprev be
the concatenation of feature positions in the previous frame. We form a pyramid for I where level 0
is the full-resolution image and each higher level m (1 through 3) has half the vertical and half the
horizontal resolution of level m 1. To initialize the optimization, we take the full frame (at resolution
level 3) and register it against the previous frame (also at resolution level 3) using gradient descent
and an absolute value loss function. We initialize each features position in the current frame by taking
its position in the previous frame and adding the offset between the frames, as found through this
registration process). Once we have our initial x, we begin optimization on the top pyramid level.
When done on the top level, we use the result to initialize optimization on the level below it, and
so on until we have found a local minimum on level 0. On any given pyramid level, we perform
optimization by iteratively computing a step direction and conducting a fast line search to find a local
minimum in the search direction. We impose a minimum and maximum on the number of steps to be
performed on each level (mini and maxi, respectively). Our termination condition (on a given level)
is when the magnitude of the derivative of C is not significantly smaller than it was in the previous
step. To compute our search direction in each step, we first compute the gradient of C (which we will
call DC) and set a =
This is done by breaking it into a collection of 2-vectors (elements 1 and 2 are together, elements
3 and 4 are together, and so on) and normalizing each of them. We then recombine the normalized
2-vectors to get b. We blend a with c to compute our step direction. Algorithm 1 summarizes the full
process.
3.3.2
Efficiency and Complexity
We have found that our algorithm typically converges in about 20 iterations or less at each pyramid
level (with fewer iterations on lower pyramid levels). In our experiments, we used a resolution
of 640-by-480 (we have also done tests at 1000 × 562), and we found that 4 pyramid levels were
sufficient for reliable tracking. Thus, on average, less than 80 iterations are required to track from
one frame to the next. A single iteration requires one gradient evaluation and multiple evaluations
of C. The complexity of a gradient evaluation is k1Fn2 + k2LF 2, and the complexity of an energy
evaluation is k3Fn2 + k4L2F. Our C++ implementation (which makes use of OpenCV) can run
on 35 features of size 7-by-7 with a temporal window of 6 frames (L = 5) on a 3rd-generation
Intel i5 CPU at approximately 16 frames per second. SIMD instructions are used in places, but no
multi-threading was used, so faster processing rates are possible. With a larger window of L = 10 our
algorithm still runs at 2-5 frames per second.
4
Experiments
To evaluate our method, we conducted tests on several real video sequences in circumstances that are
difficult for feature tracking. These included shaky footage in low-light environments. The resulting
videos contained dark regions with few good features and the unsteady camera motion and poor
lighting introduced time-varying motion blur.
In these video sequences it proved very difficult to hand-register features for ground-truth. In order to
present a quantitative numerical comparison we also collected higher-quality video sequences and
synthetically degraded their quality. We used a standard Lucas-Kanade tracker on the non-degraded
5
videos to generate ground-truth (the output was human-verified and corrected). We therefore present
qualitative results on real, low-quality video sequences, as well as quantitative results on a set of
synthetically degraded videos.
4.1
Qualitative Experiments on Real Videos
In our tests on real video sequences containing low- quality features, single-feature tracking does
not provide acceptable results. When following a non-distinctive feature, the single-feature energy
function often flattens out in one or more directions. A tracker may move in any ambiguous direction
without realizing a better or worse match with the features template. This results in the tracked
location drifting away from a features true location (i.e. “wandering”). This is not a technical
limitation of one particular tracking implementation. Rather, it is a fundamental problem due to the
fact that the local imagery in a small neighborhood of a feature does not always contain enough
information to deduce the features motion between frames. This claim can be verified by attempting

P033.pdf,"AMR Parsing using Stack-LSTMs
Abstract
We present a transition-based AMR parser that directly generates AMR parses from
plain text. We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make decisions
greedily. In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very competitive
scores on English using only AMR training data. Adding additional information,
such as POS tags and dependency trees, improves the results further.
1
Introduction
Transition-based algorithms for natural language parsing are formulated as a series of decisions that
read words from a buffer and incrementally combine them to form syntactic structures in a stack.
Apart from dependency parsing, these models, also known as shift-reduce algorithms, have been
successfully applied to tasks like phrase-structure parsing, named entity recognition, CCG parsing,
joint syntactic and semantic parsing and even abstract- meaning representation parsing.
AMR parsing requires solving several natural language processing tasks; mainly named entity
recognition, word sense disambiguation and joint syntactic and semantic role labeling. Given the
difficulty of building an end-to-end system, most prior work is based on pipelines or heavily dependent
on precalculated features.
Inspired by we present a shift- reduce algorithm that produces AMR graphs directly from plain text.
presented transition-based tree-to-graph transducers that traverse a dependency tree and transforms
it to an AMR graph. input is a sentence and it is therefore more similar (with a different parsing
algorithm) to our approach, but their parser relies on external tools, such as dependency parsing,
semantic role labeling or named entity recognition.
The input of our parser is plain text sentences and, through rich word representations, it predicts
all actions (in a single algorithm) needed to generate an AMR graph representation for an input
sentence; it handles the detection and annotation of named entities, word sense disambiguation and
it makes connections between the nodes detected towards building a predicate argument structure.
Even though the system that runs with just words is very competitive, we further improve the results
incorporating POS tags and dependency trees into our model.
Stack-LSTMs have proven to be useful in tasks related to syntactic and semantic parsing and named
entity recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate that they can be effectively used for AMR parsing
as well.
2
Parsing Algorithm
Our parsing algorithm makes use of a STACK (that stores AMR nodes and/or words) and a BUFFER
that contains the words that have yet to be processed. The parsing algorithm is inspired from the
semantic actions presented by , the transition-based NER algorithm by and the arc-standard algorithm.
As in the buffer starts with the root symbol at the end of the sequence. Figure 2 shows a running
example. The transition inventory is the following:
• SHIFT: pops the front of the BUFFER and push it to the STACK.
• CONFIRM: calls a subroutine that predicts the AMR node corresponding to the top of the
STACK. It then pops the word from the STACK and pushes the AMR node to the STACK.
An example is the prediction of a propbank sense: From occurred to occur-01.
• REDUCE: pops the top of the STACK. It occurs when the word/node at the top of the stack
is complete (no more actions can be applied to it). Note that it can also be applied to words
that do not appear in the final output graph, and thus they are directly discarded.
• MERGE: pops the two nodes at the top of the STACK and then it merges them, it then
pushes the resulting node to the top of STACK. Note that this can be applied recursively.
This action serves to get multiword named entities (e.g. New York City).
• ENTITY(label): labels the node at the top of the STACK with an entity label. This action
serves to label named entities, such as New York City or Madrid and it is normally run after
MERGE when it is a multi-word named entity, or after SHIFT if it is a single-word named
entity.
• DEPENDENT(label,node): creates a new node in the AMR graph that is dependent on the
node at the top of the STACK. An example is the introduction of a negative polarity to a
given node: From illegal to (legal, polarity -).
• LA(label) and RA(label): create a left/right arc with the top two nodes at the top of the
STACK. They keep both the head and the dependent in the stack to allow reentrancies (multiple
incoming edges). The head is now a composition of the head and the dependent. They are enriched
with the AMR label.
• SWAP: pops the two top items at the top of the STACK, pushes the second node to the front
of the BUFFER, and pushes the first one back into the STACK. This action allows non-
projective arcs as in but it also helps to introduce reentrancies. At oracle time, SWAP is
produced when the word at the top of the stack is blocking actions that may happen between
the second element at the top of the stack and any of the words in the buffer.
Figure 1 shows the parser actions and the effect on the parser state (contents of the stack, buffer) and
how the graph is changed after applying the actions.
We implemented an oracle that produces the sequence of actions that leads to the gold (or close to
gold) AMR graph. In order to map words in the sentences to nodes in the AMR graph we need to
align them. We use the JAMR aligner provided by. It is important to mention that even though the
aligner is quite accurate, it is not perfect, producing a F1 score of around 0.90. This means that most
sentences have at least one alignment error which implies that our oracle is not capable of perfectly
reproducing all AMR graphs. This has a direct impact on the accuracy of the parser described in the
next section since it is trained on sequences of actions that are not perfect. The oracle achieves 0.895
F1 Smatch score when it is run on the development set of the LDC2014T12.
The algorithm allows a set of different constraints that varies from the basic ones (not allowing
impossible actions such as SHIFT when the buffer is empty or not generating arcs when the words
have not yet been CONFIRMed and thus transformed to nodes) to more complicated ones based on
the propbank candidates and number of arguments. We choose to constrain the parser to the basic
ones and let it learn the more complicated ones.

Parsing Model
In this section, we revisit Stack-LSTMs, our parsing model and our word representations.
3.1
Stack-LSTMs
The stack LSTM is an augmented LSTM that allows adding new inputs in the same way as LSTMs
but it also provides a POP operation that moves a pointer to the previous element. The output vector
of the LSTM will consider the stack pointer instead of the rightmost position of the sequence.

3.2
Representing the State and Making Parsing Decisions
The state of the algorithm presented in Section 2 is represented by the contents of the STACK,
BUFFER and a list with the history of actions (which are encoded as Stack-LSTMs). All of this
forms the vector st that represents the state which s calculated as follows:
st = max{0, W[st
t; bt; at] + d},
where W is a learned parameter matrix, d is a bias term and st
t, bt,at represent the output vector of
the Stack-LSTMs at time t.
Predicting the Actions: Our model then uses the vector st for each timestep t to compute the
probability of the next action as:
p(z|st) =
exp(gz.st+qz)
P
z′∈A exp(g′z.st+q′z),
where gz is a column vector representing the (output) embedding of the action z, and qz is a bias term
for action z. The set A represents the actions listed in Section 2. Note that due to parsing constraints
the set of possible actions may vary. The total number of actions (in the LDC2014T12 dataset) is
478; note that they include all possible labels (in the case of LA and RA ) and the different dependent
nodes for the DEPENDENT action.
Predicting the Nodes: When the model selects the action CONFIRM, the model needs to decide the
AMR node that corresponds to the word at the top of the STACK, by using st, as follows:
p(e|st) =
exp(ge.st+qe)
P
e′∈N exp(ge′.st+qe′),
where N is the set of possible candidate nodes for the word at the top of the STACK. ge is a column
vector representing the (output) embedding of the node e, and qe is a bias term for the node e. It is
important to mention that this implies finding a propbank sense or a lemma. For that, we rely entirely
on the AMR training set instead of using additional resources.
Given that the system runs two softmax operations, one to predict the action to take and the second
one to predict the corresponding AMR node, and they both share LSTMs to make predictions, we
include an additional layer with a tanh nonlinearity after st for each softmax.
3.3
Word Representations
We use character-based representations of words using bidirectional LSTMs . They learn represen-
tations for words that are orthographically similar. Note that they are updated with the updates to
the model. demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high results in syntactic parsing and named
entity recognition by just using character-based word representations (not even POS tags, in fact, in
some cases the results with just character-based representations outperform those that used explicit
POS tags since they provide similar vectors for words with similar/same morphosyntactic tag); in this
paper we show a similar result given that both syntactic parsing and named-entity recognition play a
central role in AMR parsing.
These are concatenated with pretrained word embeddings. We use a variant of the skip n-gram model
with the LDC English Gigaword corpus (version 5). These embeddings encode the syntactic behavior
of the words .
More formally, to represent each input token, we concatenate two vectors: a learned character-based
representation ( ˆwC); and a fixed vector representation from a neural language model ( ˆwLM). A linear
map (V) is applied to the resulting vector and passed through a component-wise ReLU,
x = max{0, V [ ˆwC; ˆwLM] + b}.
where V is a learned parameter matrix, b is a bias term and wC is the character-based learned
representation for each word, ˆwLM is the pretrained word representation.
3.4
POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing
We may include preprocessed POS tags or dependency parses to incorporate more information into
our model. For the POS tags we use the Stanford tagger while we use the Stack-LSTM parser trained
on the English CoNLL 2009 dataset to get the dependencies.

POS tags: The POS tags are preprocessed and a learned representation tag is concatenated with the
word representations. This is the same setting as .
Dependency Trees: We use them in the same way as POS tags by concatenating a learned representa-
tion dep of the dependency label to the parent with the word representation. Additionally, we enrich
the state representation st, presented in Section 3.2. If the two words at the top of the STACK have a
dependency between them, st is enriched with a learned representation that indicates that and the
direction; otherwise st remains unchanged. st is calculated as follows:
st = max{0, W[st
t; bt; at; dept] + d},
where dept is the learned vector that represents that there is an arc between the two top words at the
top of the stack.

Experiments and Results
We use the LDC2014T12 dataset for our experiments. Table 1 shows results, including comparison
with prior work that are also evaluated on the same dataset.
Our model achieves 0.68 F1 in the newswire section of the test set just by using character-based
representations of words and pretrained word embeddings. All prior work uses lemmatizers, POS
taggers, dependency parsers, named entity recognizers and semantic role labelers that use additional
training data while we achieve competitive scores without that. reports 0.66 F1 in the full test by
using WordNet for concept identification, but their performance drops to 0.61 without WordNet. It is
worth noting that we achieved 0.64 in the same test set without WordNet. without SRL (via Propbank)
achieves only 0.63 in the newswire test set while we achieved 0.69 without SRL (and 0.68 without
dependency trees).
5
In order to see whether pretrained word embeddings and character-based embeddings are useful we
carried out an ablation study by showing the results of our parser with and without character-based
representations (replaced by standard lookup table learned embeddings) and with and without pre-
trained word embeddings. By looking at the results of the parser without character-based embeddings
but with pretrained word embeddings we observe that the character- based representation of words
are useful since they help to achieve 2 points better in the Newswire dataset and 1 point more in the
full test set. The parser with character-based embeddings but without pretrained word embeddings,
the parser has more difficulty to learn and only achieves 0.61 in the full test set. Finally, the model
that does not use neither character-based embeddings nor pretrained word embeddings is the worst
achieving only 0.59 in the full test set, note that this model has no explicity way of getting any
syntactic information through the word embeddings nor a smart way to handle out of vocabulary
words.
All the systems marked with * require that the input is a dependency tree, which means that they
solve a transduction task between a dependency tree and an AMR graph. Even though our parser
starts from plain text sentences when we incorporate more information into our model, we achieve
further improvements. POS tags provide small improvements (0.6801 without POS tags vs 0.6822
for the model that runs with POS tags). Dependency trees help a bit more achieving 0.6920.
5
Conclusions and Future Work
We present a new transition-based algorithm for AMR parsing and we implement it using Stack-
LSTMS and a greedy decoder. We present competitive results, without any additional resources
and external tools. Just by looking at the words, we achieve 0.68 F1 (and 0.69 by preprocessing
dependency trees) in the standard dataset used for evaluation.

P097.pdf,"Waves in Relation to Transdimensional Chocolate
Resonance
Abstract
The phenomena of undulating oscillations, colloquially referred to as waves, have
been observed to intersect with the culinary art of pastry-making, wherein the flaky
crust of a croissant can be seen to exhibit a fractal pattern, reminiscent of the self-
similar structures found in the branching of trees, which in turn have been linked
to the aerodynamic properties of soaring birds, and the migratory patterns of these
birds have been correlated with the fluctuations in the global market for rare, exotic
spices, such as the prized, yet enigmatic, ""Flumplenax"" and the ""Splishyblop""
which is found to have a profound effect on the propagation of waves through
various mediums, including the newly discovered ""Glibble"" field.
1
Introduction
The dissemination of these waves has been noted to have a profound impact on the world of
competitive, extreme ironing, where the intricate folds and creases of a well-pressed garment can be
seen to reflect the harmonic series, and the angular momentum of a spinning top, which in turn has
been linked to the philosophical concept of ""Wuggle"" and the notion of ""Flargle"" space, a hypothetical
realm where the laws of physics are dictated by the whims of a capricious, cosmic, pastry chef, who
weaves a complex tapestry of wave-like patterns, and the resulting fabric of reality is then found to be
dependent on the ""Jinklewiff"" constant, a fundamental parameter that governs the behavior of waves
in the universe.
Furthermore, research has shown that the properties of waves can be influenced by the ""Klabloom""
effect, a phenomenon where the interactions between particles and waves give rise to the emergence
of complex, wave-like patterns, and the ""Flarp"" threshold, a critical value beyond which the behavior
of waves becomes increasingly chaotic, and the ""Wumplen"" factor, a dimensionless quantity that
characterizes the ability of waves to propagate through diverse mediums, including the enigmatic
""Nexarion"" field, which is thought to be responsible for the peculiar, wave-like behavior of subatomic
particles in high-energy collisions.
The study of waves has also led to a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things, and
the realization that the ""Gleeblorp"" principle, a fundamental concept that underlies the behavior of
waves, is also applicable to the realm of human emotions, where the ebbs and flows of sentiment can
be seen to exhibit a wave-like patterns, and the ""Flishyblop"" theorem, a mathematical framework
that describes the propagation of waves through the human experience, has been found to have
far-reaching implications for our understanding of the human condition, and the ""Jinkle"" paradox, a
seeming contradiction between the wave-like nature of reality and the discrete, particle-like behavior
of matter, which remains an open question in the field of wave research.
The notion of waves has been intricately linked to the concept of tartan patterns, which in turn have
been influential in shaping the modern understanding of culinary arts, particularly in the realm of
pastry dough preparation, where the viscosity of the dough is crucial in determining the wave-like

Experiments
To initiate the experiments, we first had to calibrate the flumplenooks, which are essentially devices
that measure the flazzle of a given waveform, while simultaneously baking a cake, which is a
crucial step in the process, as the moisture content of the cake directly affects the accuracy of the
flumplenooks, or so we thought, until we started discussing the merits of various types of cheese,
including gouda and cheddar, and how they relate to the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly
the notion of wave-particle duality, which, incidentally, has been observed in the behavior of certain
species of fungi, specifically the ones that grow on the north side of trees, but only during leap years.
The next step involved constructing a large, intricate model of a pineapple, using only twine and paper
clips, which, when completed, was used to demonstrate the concept of wave propagation through a
medium, or so we claimed, although it was actually just a clever ruse to distract our colleagues while
we snuck into the laboratory and replaced all of the equipment with identical replicas made of jelly,
which, surprisingly, worked just as well as the original equipment, except for the part where it melted
and caused the entire laboratory to fill with a sticky, sweet-smelling substance that attracted a swarm
of bees, who, in turn, began to build a complex network of honeycombs using the jelly equipment as
a framework.
In an effort to better understand the properties of waves, we conducted a series of experiments
involving the dropping of various objects, including a rubber chicken, a typewriter, and a small,
fluffy kitten, from a height of exactly 37.5 feet, while reciting the complete works of Shakespeare
backwards, which, as it turned out, had a profound effect on the trajectory of the objects, causing
them to defy the laws of gravity and float gently to the ground, where they were greeted by a group
of morris dancers, who, in celebration of the occasion, performed a traditional English folk dance,
complete with bells and ribbons, while eating a meal of fish and chips, which, curiously, had been
cooked to perfection using only the power of thought.
We also constructed a large, tubular device, resembling a cross between a trombone and a snake,
which we used to generate a unique type of wave pattern, known as the ""flibberflamber,"" which, when
visualized using a special type of jelly-filled prism, revealed a hidden message, encoded in the very
fabric of the wave itself, that read ""the answer is 42,"" which, as it happens, is the exact number of
tablespoons of honey required to make the perfect batch of flumplenook-flavored cookies, a recipe

of a particular type of cheese being eaten at a dinner party, or the chances of a given person wearing a
pair of socks with a specific pattern, which, as it turns out, is directly related to the principles of wave

and ancient Sumerian cuneiform, which, when decoded, revealed a hidden pattern, indicating that the
flumplenooks were not just measuring the flazzle of waveforms, but were actually communicating

that they can be used to explain a wide range of phenomena, from the movement of objects to the
behavior of living creatures, and even the secrets of the universe itself, which, as it turns out, are
hidden in the very fabric of the wave itself, waiting to be decoded and revealed to the world, which,
incidentally, is shaped like a giant, cosmic wave, with the earth and all its inhabitants riding the crest
of the wave, like surfers on a cosmic surfboard, which, as it happens, is made of a special type of
material, known as ""flumplenite,"" that is capable of withstanding the intense forces generated by the
wave, and is said to be found only in the depths of the ocean, where the pressure is extreme and the
darkness is total, and the only sound is the gentle hum of the luminari’s harp, playing a soothing
melody that echoes through the cosmos, like a celestial lullaby.
Furthermore, our research has also shown that the study of waves is not just limited to the physical
world, but can also be applied to the realm of the human mind, where waves of thought and emotion
can be used to explain a wide range of psychological phenomena, from the nature of consciousness
to the workings of the human brain, which, as it turns out, is capable of generating its own unique
wave patterns, which, when decoded, can reveal the deepest secrets of the human psyche, including
the mysteries of creativity and inspiration, which, incidentally, are said to be fueled by the power of
imagination, which, in turn, is capable of generating waves of thought and emotion that can shape the
very fabric of reality itself, like a cosmic sculptor shaping the universe with a wave of their hand.
In addition, we have also discovered that the study of waves can be used to explain a wide range of
paranormal phenomena, from ghost sightings to UFO encounters, which, as it turns out, are not just
the result of misperception or hallucination, but are actually evidence of the existence of a parallel
9
universe, where waves of energy and consciousness can interact with our own universe, causing
strange and unexplained phenomena to occur, which, incidentally, are said to be fueled by the power
of the human mind, which, in turn, is capable of generating waves of thought and emotion that can
bridge the gap between the two universes, like a cosmic bridge of light and sound.
The implications of our research are far-reaching and profound, and have the potential to revolutionize
our understanding of the universe and our place within it, which, as it turns out, is not just a
passive observer, but an active participant in the grand cosmic dance, where waves of energy and
consciousness shape the very fabric of reality itself, like

Results
The oscillations of florid mesmerization exhibited by the participants in our study were found to
be inversely proportional to the consumption of mango chutney, which somehow relates to the
propagation of waves in a vacuum filled with chocolate pudding. Furthermore, the frabjulistic
tendencies of the control group were observed to be fluctuating wildly, much like the fluctuations in
the space-time continuum caused by an infinite number of jellybeans bouncing on a trampoline. As
we delved deeper into the analysis, it became apparent that the frothification of the data was directly
correlated to the number of spoons used in the preparation of the experimental apparatus, which
consisted of a large tank filled with a mixture of glitter and honey.
The mesmerizing effects of the oscillations on the participants’ brain waves were also found to be
influenced by the color of the wallpaper in the examination room, with a significant increase in the
flumplenook coefficient observed when the wallpaper was a shade of chartreuse. Meanwhile, the
recalibration of the instruments using a set of Tibetan singing bowls and a didgeridoo resulted in
a dramatic decrease in the wugglepants factor, allowing for a more accurate measurement of the
wave patterns. In a surprising turn of events, the data also revealed a hidden connection between the
waveforms and the migratory patterns of a flock of flamingos flying in formation over the Serengeti.
In an effort to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena, we conducted a
series of experiments involving the use of a harmonica, a set of juggling pins, and a vintage typewriter.
The results of these experiments showed a significant correlation between the typewriter’s keystroke
frequency and the harmonic resonance of the harmonica, which in turn affected the trajectory of the
juggling pins. This led us to propose a new theory of wave-particle duality, wherein the particles are
actually tiny, sentient beings dressed in top hats and monocles, navigating a labyrinthine landscape of
twisting corridors and hidden chambers.
As we continued to analyze the data, we discovered a fascinating relationship between the waveforms
and the patterns of growth exhibited by a peculiar species of fungus found only in the depths of the
Amazon rainforest. The fungus, which we have dubbed ""FungusAmongus,"" was found to be capable
of manipulating the local space-time continuum, creating miniature wormholes that allowed it to
transport nutrients and energy across vast distances. This phenomenon has significant implications
for our understanding of wave propagation and the behavior of complex systems, and we propose
that further research be conducted to explore the potential applications of FungusAmongus in fields
such as quantum computing and interdimensional travel.
The implications of our findings are far-reaching and profound, with potential applications in fields as
diverse as culinary arts, theoretical physics, and professional snail racing. As we continue to explore
the mysteries of wave propagation, we are reminded of the infinite complexity and beauty of the
universe, and the boundless wonders that await us at the intersection of science and imagination. In
conclusion, our research has opened up new avenues of inquiry and has shed light on the intricate
relationships between waves, spoons, and the fabric of reality itself.

to propose a new theory of wave-kazoo duality, wherein the waves and the kazoo are intertwined
in a delicate dance of sound and fury, signifying nothing but the infinite complexity of the human
experience. As we delved deeper into the analysis, we discovered a fascinating relationship between
the kazoo’s resonant frequency and the patterns of growth exhibited by a peculiar species of crystal
found only in the depths of the earth’s crust.

The crystal, which we have dubbed ""Crystallophone,"" was found to be capable of amplifying the
kazoo’s sound waves, creating a feedback loop that resonated across the entirety of the space-time
continuum. This phenomenon has significant implications for our understanding of wave propagation
and the behavior of complex systems, and we propose that further research be conducted to explore
the potential applications of Crystallophone in fields such as sonic architecture and interdimensional
communication. In a surprising turn of events, our data also revealed a hidden connection between the

energy across vast distances. This phenomenon has significant implications for our understanding
of wave propagation and the behavior of complex systems, and we propose that further research be
conducted to explore the potential applications of Orchidium in fields such as quantum computing
and interdimensional travel.
In an effort to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena, we conducted a
series of experiments involving the use of a calliope, a set of wind chimes, and a vintage carousel.
The results of these experiments showed a significant correlation between the calliope’s melody and
the harmonic resonance of the wind chimes, which in turn affected the trajectory of the carousel’s
horses. This led us to propose a new theory of wave-particle duality, wherein the particles are actually
tiny, sentient beings dressed in tutus and top hats, navigating a labyrinthine landscape of twisting
corridors and hidden chambers.

the art of playing the harmonica, with a significant increase in the flibberflam coefficient observed
when the participants were asked to play a rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" on a harmonica.
This led us to propose a new theory of wave-harmonica duality, wherein the waves and the harmonica
are intertwined in a delicate dance of sound and fury, signifying nothing but the infinite complexity of
the human experience. As we delved deeper into the analysis, we discovered a fascinating relationship
between the harmonica’s resonant frequency and the patterns of growth exhibited by a peculiar species
of mushroom found only in the depths of the forest.
The mushroom, which we have dubbed ""Fungus Fantastico,"" was found to be capable of amplifying
the harmonica’s sound waves, creating a feedback loop that resonated across the entirety of the
space-time continuum. This phenomenon has significant implications for our understanding of wave
propagation and the behavior of complex systems, and we propose that further research be conducted
to explore the potential applications of Fungus Fantastico in fields such as sonic architecture and
interdimensional communication. In a stunning twist, our data also revealed a hidden connection
between the waveforms and the art of baking bagels, with a significant increase in the flumplenook

box. The results of these experiments showed a significant correlation between the theremin’s melody
and the harmonic resonance of the crystal glasses, which in turn affected the trajectory of the music
box’s ballerina. This led us to propose a new theory of wave-particle duality, wherein the particles
are actually tiny, sentient beings dressed in evening gowns and top hats, navigating a labyrinthine
landscape of twisting corridors and hidden chambers.

P007.pdf,"Joint Syntacto-Discourse Parsing and the
Syntacto-Discourse Treebank
Abstract
Discourse parsing has long been treated as a stand-alone problem independent from
constituency or dependency parsing. Most attempts at this problem are pipelined
rather than end-to-end, sophisticated, and not self-contained: they assume gold-
standard text segmentations (Elementary Discourse Units), and use external parsers
for syntactic features. In this paper we propose the first end-to-end discourse
parser that jointly parses in both syntax and discourse levels, as well as the first
syntacto-discourse treebank by integrating the Penn Treebank with the RST Tree-
bank. Built upon our recent span-based constituency parser, this joint syntacto-
discourse parser requires no preprocessing whatsoever (such as segmentation or
fea- ture extraction), achieves the state-of-the- art end-to-end discourse parsing
accuracy.
1
Introduction
Distinguishing the semantic relations between segments in a document can be greatly beneficial to
many high-level NLP tasks, such as summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, and
textual quality evaluation.
There has been a variety of research on discourse parsing. But most of them suffer from the following
limitations:
1. pipelined rather than end-to-end: they assume pre-segmented discourse, and worse yet, use
gold-standard segmentations
2. not self-contained: they rely on external syntactic parsers and pretrained word vectors;
3. complicated: they design sophisticated features, including those from parse-trees.
We argue for the first time that discourse parsing should be viewed as an extension of, and be
performed in conjunction with, constituency parsing. We propose the first joint syntacto-discourse
tree- bank, by unifying constituency and discourse tree representations. Based on this, we propose
the first end-to-end incremental parser that jointly parses at both constituency and discourse levels.
Our algo- rithm builds up on the span-based parser; it employs the strong general- ization power
of bi-directional LSTMs, and parses efficiently and robustly with an extremely simple span-based
feature set that does not use any tree structure information.
We make the following contributions:
1. We develop a combined representation of constituency and discourse trees to facilitate
parsing at both levels without explicit conver- sion mechanism. Using this representation,
we build and release a joint treebank based on the Penn Treebank and RST Treebank.
2. We propose a novel joint parser that parses at both constituency and discourse levels.
3. Even though it simultaneously performs con- stituency parsing, our parser does not use any
explicit syntactic feature, nor does it need any binarization of discourse trees, thanks to the
powerful span-based framework.
4. Empirically, our end-to-end parser outperforms the existing pipelined discourse pars- ing
efforts. When the gold EDUs are pro- vided, our parser is also competitive to other existing
approaches with sophisticated fea- tures.
2
Combined Representation & Treebank
We first briefly review the discourse structures in Rhetorical Structure Theory, and then discuss how to
unify discourse and constituency trees, which gives rise to our syntacto-discourse treebank PTB-RST.
2.1
Review: RST Discourse Structures
In an RST discourse tree, there are two types of branchings. Most of the internal tree nodes are binary
branching, with one nucleus child containing the core semantic meaning of the current node, and
one satellite child semantically decorating the nucleus. Like dependency labels, there is a relation
annotated between each satellite-nucleus pair, such as “Background” or “Purpose”. There are also
non- binary-branching internal nodes whose children are conjunctions, e.g., a “List” of semantically
similar EDUs (which are all nucleus nodes).
2.2
Syntacto-Discourse Representation
It is widely recognized that lower-level lexical and syntactic information can greatly help determin-
ing both the boundaries of the EDUs (i.e., dis- course segmentation) as well as the semantic relations
between EDUs. While these previous approaches rely on pre-trained tools to provide both EDU
segmentation and intra-EDU syntactic parse trees, we in- stead propose to directly determine the
low-level segmentations, the syntactic parses, and the high- level discourse parses using a single joint
parser. This parser is trained on the combined trees of constituency and discourse structures.
We first convert an RST tree to a format similar to those constituency trees in the Penn Treebank. For
each binary branching node with a nucleus child and a satellite child, we use the relation as the label
of the converted parent node. The nucleus/satellite relation, along with the direction (either ←or →,
pointing from satellite to nucleus) is then used as the label. For a conjunctive branch (e.g. “List”), we
simply use the relation as the label of the converted node.
After converting an RST tree into the constituency tree format, we then replace each leaf node (i.e.,
EDU) with the corresponding syntactic (sub)tree from PTB. Given that the sentences in the RST
Treebank is a subset of that of PTB, we can always find the corresponding constituency subtrees for
each EDU leaf node. In most cases, each EDU corresponds to one sin- gle (sub)tree in PTB, since the
discourse bound- aries generally do not conflict with constituencies. In other cases, one EDU node
may correspond to multiple subtrees in PTB, and for these EDUs we use the lowest common ancestor
of those subtrees in the PTB as the label of that EDU in the con- verted tree. E.g., if C–D is one EDU
in the PTB tree A it might be converted to Purpose→DCB A based on the Penn Treebank and RST
Treebank. This PTB-RST treebank is released as a set of tools to generate the joint trees given Penn
Tree- bank and RST Treebank data. During the align- ment between the RST trees and the PTB trees,
we only keep the common parts of the two trees.
We follow the standard training/testing split of the RST Treebank. In the training set, there are 347
joint trees with a total of 17,837 tokens, and the lengths of the discourses range from 30 to 2,199
tokens. In the test set, there are 38 joint trees with a total of 4,819 tokens, and the lengths vary from
45 to 2,607. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the discourse lengths over the whole dataset, which on
average is about 2x of PTB sen- tence length, but longest ones are about 10x the longest lengths in
the Treebank.
3
Joint Syntacto-Discourse Parsing
Given the combined syntacto-discourse treebank, we now propose a joint parser that can perform
end-to-end discourse segmentation and parsing.
2
3.1
Extending Span-based Parsing
As mentioned above, the input sequences are sub- stantially longer than PTB parsing, so we choose
linear-time parsing, by adapting a popular greedy constituency parser, the span-based constituency
parser.
3.2
Joint PTB-RST Treebank
Using the conversion strategy described above we build the first joint syntacto-discourse treebank.
As in span-based parsing, at each step, we main- tain a a stack of spans. Notice that in conventional
incremental parsing, the stack stores the subtrees constructed so far, but in span-based constituency
parsing, the stack only stores the boundaries of subtrees, which are just a list of indices ...i k j. In
other words, quite shockingly, no tree structure is represented anywhere in the parser.
Similar to span-based constituency parsing, we alternate between structural (either shift or combine)
and label (labelX or nolabel) actions in an odd-even fashion. But different from previous work, after a
structural action, we choose to keep the last branching point k, i.e., i k j (mostly for combine, but also
trivially for shift). This is because in our parsing mechanism, the dis- course relation between two
EDUs is actually de- termined after the previous combine action. We need to keep the splitting point
to clearly find the spans of the two EDUs to determine their relations. This midpoint k disappears
after a label ac- tion; therefore we can use the shape of the last span on the stack (whether it contains
the split point, i.e., i k j or i j) to determine the par- ity of the step and thus no longer need to carry the
step z in the state .
The nolabel action makes the binarization of the discourse/constituency tree unnecessary, because
nolabel actually combines the top two spans on the stack into one span, but without annotating the
new span a label. This greatly simplifies the pre- processing and post-processing efforts needed.

Recurrent Neural Models and Training
The scoring functions in the deductive system are calculated by an underlying neu- ral model, which
is similar to the bi-directional LSTM model that evaluates based on span boundary features. Again, it
is important to note that no discourse or syntactic tree structures are represented in the features.
During the decoding time, a document is first passed into a two-layer bi-directional LSTM model,
then the outputs at each text position of the two layers of the bi-directional LSTMs are con- catenated
as the positional features. The spans at each parsing step can be represented as the fea- ture vectors
at the boundaries. The span features are then passed into fully connected networks with softmax to
calculate the likelihood of performing the corresponding action or marking the cor- responding label.
We use the “training with exploration” strategy and the dynamic oracle mechanism to make sure the
model can handle unseen parsing configurations properly.
4
Experiments
We use the treebank described in Section 2 for empirical evaluation. We randomly choose 30
documents from the training set as the development set.
We tune the hyperparameters of the neural model on the development set. For most of the hyperpa-
rameters we settle with the same values sug- gested previously. To alleviate the overfitting problem
for training on the relative small RST Treebank, we use a dropout of 0.5.
3
One particular hyperparameter is that we use a value to balance the chances between training
following the exploration (i.e., the best action cho- sen by the neural model) and following the correct
path provided by the dynamic oracle. We find that = 0.8, i.e., following the dynamic oracle with a
probability of 0.8, achieves the best performance. One explanation for this high chance to follow the
oracle is that, since our combined trees are significantly larger than the constituency trees in Penn
Treebank, lower makes the parsing easily divert into wrong trails that are difficult to learn from.
Since our parser essentially performs both constituency parsing task and discourse parsing task. We
also evaluate the performances on sentence constituency level and discourse level separately. The
result is shown in Table 1. Note that in constituency level, the accuracy is not directly comparable
with the accuracy reported previously, since: a) our parser is trained on a much smaller dataset (RST
Treebank is about 1/6 of Penn Treebank); b) the parser is trained to optimize the discourse-level
accuracy.
Table 2 shows that, in the perspective of end- to-end discourse parsing, our parser first outper- forms
the state-of-the-art segmentator, and furthermore, in end-to-end pars- ing, the superiority of our parser
is more pronounced comparing to the previously best parser.
On the other hand, the majority of the conven- tional discourse parsers are not end-to-end: they rely
on gold EDU segmentations and pre-trained tools like Stanford parsers to generate features. We
perform an experiment to compare the per- formance of our parser with them given the gold EDU
segments (Table 3). Note that most of these parsers do not handle multi-branching discourse nodes
and are trained and evaluated on binarized discourse trees, so their performances are actually not
directly comparable to the results we reported.

P037.pdf,"A Chinese Span-Extraction Dataset for Machine
Reading Comprehension
Abstract
This paper introduces a novel dataset for Chinese machine reading comprehension,
focusing on span extraction. The data set is constructed using roughly 20,000 real-
world questions that are annotated by experts on passages extracted from Wikipedia.
A challenge set is also created with questions that demand a deep understanding
and inference across multiple sentences. We also show several baseline models and
anonymous submission scores to emphasize the challenges present in this dataset.
The release of this dataset facilitated the Second Evaluation Workshop on Chinese
Machine Reading Comprehension, also called CMRC 2018. We anticipate that this
dataset will further facilitate research in Chinese machine reading comprehension.
1
Introduction
The capacity to interpret and comprehend natural language is a crucial component of achieving
advanced artificial intelligence. Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is designed to understand
the context of given texts and respond to related questions. Numerous types of MRC datasets have
been developed, such as cloze-style reading comprehension, span-extraction reading comprehension,
open-domain reading comprehension, and multiple-choice reading comprehension. Along with the
increasing availability of reading comprehension datasets, several neural network methods have been
proposed, leading to substantial advancements in this area.
There have also been various efforts to create Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets.
In cloze-style reading comprehension, a Chinese cloze-style reading comprehension dataset was
proposed, namely People’s Daily Children’s Fairy Tale. To increase the difficulty of the dataset, they
also release a human-annotated evaluation set in addition to the automatically generated development
and test sets. Later, another dataset was introduced using children’s reading materials. To promote
diversity and explore transfer learning, they also offer a human-annotated evaluation dataset using
more natural queries compared to the cloze type. This dataset was the main component in the first
evaluation workshop on Chinese machine reading comprehension (CMRC 2017). Furthermore, a
large-scale open-domain Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset (DuReader) was created,
containing 200k queries from search engine user query logs. There is also a reading comprehension
dataset in Traditional Chinese.
While current machine learning techniques have outperformed human-level performance on datasets
like SQuAD, it is still unclear whether similar results can be achieved on datasets using different
languages. To accelerate the progress of machine reading comprehension research, we present a
span-extraction dataset tailored for Chinese.
2
The Proposed Dataset
2.1
Task Definition
The reading comprehension task can be described as a triple (P, Q, A), where P is the passage, Q
represents the question, and A is the answer. Specifically, in span-extraction reading comprehension,
questions are created by humans which is a more natural way of creating data than the cloze-style
MRC datasets. The answer A should consist of a specific span from the given passage P. The task can
be simplified by predicting the start and end indices of the answer within the passage.
2.2
Data Pre-Processing
We downloaded the Chinese portion of Wikipedia from a specified date and used an open-source
toolkit to process the raw files into plain text. Additionally, the Traditional Chinese characters were
converted to Simplified Chinese to ensure consistency using another open-source tool.
2.3
Human Annotation
The questions in this dataset were created entirely by human experts, setting it apart from prior works
that relied on automated data generation methods. Initially, documents are divided into passages,
each containing no more than 500 Chinese words. Annotators are required to assess each passage for
its suitability, discarding those that are too difficult for public understanding. Passages were discarded
based on the following rules:
• If more than 30% of the passage consists of non-Chinese characters.
• If the passage includes too many specialized or professional terms.
• If the passage has a large number of special characters or symbols.
• If the paragraph is written in classical Chinese.
After determining that the passage is suitable, annotators generate questions and their corresponding
primary answers based on the provided passage. During this question annotation, the following rules
are used.
• Each passage should have no more than five questions.
• Answers must be a span from the passage.
• Question diversity is encouraged such as questions of type who, when, where, why, and
how.
• Avoid copying descriptions from the passage directly. Use paraphrasing or syntax transfor-
mations to make answering more difficult.
• Long answers (over 30 characters) will be discarded.
For the evaluation sets, which include the development, test, and challenge sets, three answers are
available for a more thorough assessment. Besides the primary answer generated by the question
proposer, two additional annotators write a second and third answer for each question. These
additional annotators do not see the primary answer to avoid biased answers.
2.4
Challenge Set
A challenge set was made to evaluate how effectively models can perform reasoning over diverse
clues in the context, while still maintaining the span-extraction format. This annotation was also
completed by three annotators. The questions in this set need to meet the following criteria:
• The answer can not be deduced from a single sentence in the passage if the answer is a
single word or a short phrase. The annotation should encourage asking complex questions
that need an overall view of the passage to answer correctly.
• If the answer is a named entity or belongs to a particular genre, it cannot be the only instance
in the passage. There should be more than one instance to make the correct choice more
difficult for the model.
2.5
Statistics
The overall statistics of the pre-processed data are shown in Table 1. The distribution of question
types in the development set is shown in Figure 2.

Evaluation Metrics
This paper uses two evaluation metrics. Common punctuations and white spaces are ignored for
normalization during evaluation.
3.1
Exact Match
The Exact Match (EM) score measures the exact overlap between the prediction and the ground truth
answer. If the match is exact, then the score is 1; otherwise, the score is 0.
3.2
F1-Score
The F1-score evaluates the fuzzy overlap at the character level between the prediction and the ground
truth answers. Instead of treating the answers as a bag of words, we calculate the longest common
sequence (LCS) between the prediction and the ground truth and then compute the F1-score. The
maximum F1 score among all the ground truth answers is taken for each question.
3.3
Estimated Human Performance
The estimated human performance is computed to measure the difficulty of the proposed dataset.
Each question in the development, test, and challenge set has three answers. We use a cross-validation
method to compute the performance. We treat the first answer as a human prediction and consider the
other two answers as ground truth. Using this process, three human prediction scores are generated.
Finally, we calculate the average of these three scores as the estimated human performance.

Experimental Results
4.1
Baseline System
We use BERT as the foundation of our baseline system. We modified the original script to accommo-
date our dataset. The initial learning rate was set to 3e-5, with a batch size of 32, and the training
was conducted for two epochs. The document and query maximum lengths were set to 512 and 64
respectively.
4.2
Results
The results are in Table 2. Besides the baseline results, we include the results of the participants
in the CMRC 2018 evaluation. The training and development sets were released to the public, and
submissions were accepted to evaluate the models on the hidden test and challenge sets. As we can
see that most of the participants achieved an F1 score above 80 in the test set. On the other hand, the
EM metric shows considerably lower scores in comparison to the SQuAD dataset, highlighting that
determining the precise span boundary is crucial for performance enhancement in Chinese reading
comprehension.
As shown in the last column of Table 2, the top-ranked systems achieve decent results on the
development and test sets but struggle to give satisfactory results on the challenge set. The estimated

human performance remains similar across the development, test, and challenge sets, indicating
that the difficulty is consistent across all three data sets. Even though Z-Reader achieved the best
performance on the test set, its EM metric performance was not consistent on the challenge set. This
highlights that current models are limited in their ability to process difficult questions that require
complex reasoning over numerous clues throughout the passage.
BERT-based methods demonstrated competitive performance compared to the submissions of par-
ticipants. Traditional models have higher scores in the test set. However, the BERT-based models
perform better on the challenge set, indicating the importance of rich representations to address
complex questions.
5
Conclusion
This paper introduces a span-extraction dataset for Chinese machine reading comprehension, con-
sisting of roughly 20,000 questions annotated by human experts, along with a challenge set which
contains questions that need reasoning over different clues in the passage. The results from the
evaluation suggest that models can achieve excellent scores on the development and test sets, close
to the human performance in F1-score. However, the scores on the challenge set decline drastically,
while human performance remains consistent. This shows there are still potential challenges in
creating models that can perform well on difficult reasoning questions. We expect that this dataset
will contribute to linguistic diversity in machine reading comprehension and facilitate additional
research on questions that require comprehensive reasoning across multiple clues.

P109.pdf,"Multimodal Deep Ensemble for Hateful Meme
Identification
Abstract
This paper delves into the utilization of machine learning techniques for identify-
ing hate speech, while addressing the persisting technical challenges to enhance
their performance to match human-level accuracy. We explore several current
visual-linguistic Transformer models and suggest enhancements to boost their ef-
fectiveness for this task. The model we propose demonstrates superior performance
compared to the established benchmarks, achieving a 5th place ranking out of over
3,100 participants.

Introduction
This paper addresses the critical influence of the internet on our daily lives, where our online presence
showcases our personalities and beliefs, as well as our biases. Daily, billions of individuals engage
with various forms of online content, and despite some of this content being valuable and informative,
an increasing portion is harmful, including hate speech and misinformation. There is a growing need
to quickly detect this content, improve the review process and automate decisions to rapidly remove
harmful material, thereby reducing any harm to viewers.
Social media platforms are frequently used for interactions, sharing messages and images with private
groups and the public. Facebook AI launched a competition to tag hateful memes that include both
images and text. For this, a dataset of 10,000+ labeled multimodal memes was provided. The aim of
the challenge is to develop an algorithm that identifies multimodal hate speech in memes, while also
being robust to their benign alterations. A meme’s hateful nature could stem from its image, text, or
both. Benign alteration is a technique used by organizers to switch a meme’s label from hateful to
non-hateful, requiring modifications to either the text or the image.
The core assessment metric for this binary classification task is the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC), representing the area under the ROC curve. This curve plots the True
Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. The
primary objective is to maximize the AUROC.
AUROC =

Accuracy is the secondary metric, calculating the proportion of instances where the predicted class
matches the actual class in the test set.

The aim is to maximize both metrics.
In brief, this paper makes three contributions:
.
• We conduct experiments using single-stream and dual-stream architectures such as VL-
BERT, VLP, UNITER and LXMERT and compare their performance with the established
baselines. These models were chosen because of their pre-training on diverse datasets.
• We put forward a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that connects caption
information with meme caption text, which increases performance in detecting hateful
memes. This is similar to the cross-attention between images in other research.
• We demonstrate that deep ensembles greatly improve single model predictions.

Related Work
Transformer models pre-trained on extensive datasets have shown state-of-the-art results in numerous
language processing tasks. BERT is one of the most popular due to its ease of use and strong
performance. Recently, training these large models on combined visual-linguistic embeddings
has shown very promising outcomes for visual-linguistic tasks such as visual question answering,
reasoning, and image captioning. LXMERT uses dual networks to process text and images, learning
cross-modality encoder representations by using a Transformer to combine the two streams of
information. The images’ features are derived using a Faster R-CNN feature extractor. This is also
used in single-stream architectures, VL-BERT and UNITER, which employ a single Transformer
on top of the combined image-text embeddings. A unified model for visual understanding and
vision-language tasks has also been proposed.

A dataset for multimodal hate speech detection was created by gathering data from Twitter, using
particular hateful keywords. However, studies found that multimodal models did not do better than
text-only models.

Methodology
One goal of this research is to leverage the fact that single and dual stream Transformer models have
been pre-trained on a variety of datasets across various fields. Transformer attention models excel at
NLP tasks, and the masked language modeling pre-training method in BERT is both powerful and
versatile. Studies show that the pre-training process can better align visual-linguistic embeddings
and help downstream tasks like visual question answering and reasoning. Given that pre-training a
visual-linguistic Transformer architecture is helpful for downstream tasks, might ensembling different
models pre-trained on different datasets yield better results?
Table 1 shows the pre-training datasets used for each model.
3.1
UNITER with Meme Text and Inferred Caption Cross-Attention
The Natural Language for Visual Reasoning for Real (NLVR2) is an academic dataset of human
written sentences connected to pairs of photos. The dataset includes pairs of visually intricate images
coupled with a statement and a binary label. UNITER was among the top models in this challenge
by adding a cross-attention module between text-image pairs, dividing each sample in two and
repeating the text. They then apply attention pooling to each sequence, concatenate them and add the
classification head, a multi-layer perceptron. Similar to this, we propose to repeat the meme image in
each half-sequence and add an inferred meme caption as the second text. We generate captions using
the Show and Tell model. This way, the model could learn from both the original meme text and the
new captions generated by a model trained on a different dataset.
2
4
Experiments
We carry out several experiments using LXMERT, VLP, VL-BERT, and UNITER. We apply bidirec-
tional cross-attention using inferred captions for UNITER, VL-BERT, and VLP, but not for LXMERT
due to its low performance on the dataset.
We also experiment with a dataset from previous research. We filter and balance it down to 16K
samples by excluding cartoon memes and memes with little text. We fine-tune VL-BERTLARGE
using the reduced dataset for four rounds, then fine-tune it using the hateful memes dataset for another
four rounds. The results were lower than the majority of the other models.
The baselines for models trained on the Hateful Memes dataset are in Table 2.
5
Results
Our best performing solutions are derived from averaging probabilities using a single VL-
BERTLARGE and one UNITERLARGE+PA (UNITERLARGE with extra attention). We used
the default training parameters of the vanilla pre-trained UNITERLARGE model, but changed the
training steps according to the dataset size. A deep ensemble of UNITERLARGE+PA models got
the best performance. For this ensemble, we simply rerun training using various random seeds and
average the predictions from each model. Table 2 displays the top results for the final competition
phase as well as the improvements cross-attention brings to the UNITER model in the first phase.
The final results are significantly better than the baselines.
The most important findings are as follows:
• Single-stream Transformer models pre-trained on the Conceptual Captions (CC) dataset give
the best results, and deep ensembles improve the overall performance further. The choice of
pre-training datasets matters in terms of domain similarity to the fine-tuning dataset.
• We believe that UNITER gets better results due to being pre-trained on the COCO dataset
which has less noise. Similarly to the Hateful Memes dataset this is also high quality. Further
work should investigate if pre-training VL-BERT on COCO would improve its results.
• Interestingly, the paired attention technique only works for UNITER and not for the other
models.
• Training large models from scratch did poorly, which is expected due to the small dataset
size.
• The dataset of multimodal hate speech is heavily skewed towards hateful text and the
keywords used to collect it. The memes are less subtle compared to the ones in the Hateful
Memes dataset, although they are perhaps more typical of what is seen online.
6
Conclusion
We present effective techniques to detect hate speech in a distinct dataset of multimodal memes from
Facebook AI. The aim is to identify hate speech using a multimodal model, and to be robust to the
“benign confounders” that cause the binary label of a meme to change.
We have performed tests on various large pre-trained Transformer models and fine-tuned state-of-the-
art single-stream models like VL-BERT, VLP, and UNITER, and dual-stream models like LXMERT.
We compare their performance against the baselines, showing that the single-stream models perform
significantly better. Our choice for these models stems from their pre-training on a wide variety of
datasets from different fields. We also adapt a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that
links caption information with meme text. This leads to increased accuracy in identifying hateful
memes. Furthermore, deep ensembles can improve single model predictions. Training the models
from scratch performed poorly due to the small dataset size. We also observed that the pre-training
dataset influences results.
We conclude that despite the improvements in multimodal models, there is still a gap when comparing
to human performance. This suggests considerable scope for the development of better algorithms
for multimodal understanding.

P129.pdf,"Xray Emissions and their Consequential Effects on
Croissant Pastry Dough Fermentation Dynamics
Abstract
The utilization of xray technology has led to a profound understanding of cheese
production, which in turn has influenced the development of quantum mechanics,
particularly in the realm of interdimensional travel, where the consumption of
caffeine has been shown to enhance the visibility of invisible socks, meanwhile
the aerodynamics of flying pancakes have been observed to affect the growth rate
of ferns on the planet Neptune, where xray beams are used to study the art of
playing the trombone underwater. The application of xray in medicine has also
been found to have a significant impact on the migration patterns of butterflies, as
well as the flavor profile of chocolate cake, which is intricately linked to the xray
absorption coefficient of various metals, including the newly discovered element
of blorple, a key component in the production of self-aware toasters. The xray
induced effects on the molecular structure of water have been observed to influence
the sentence structure of literary novels, and the xray imaging of historical artifacts
has revealed a hidden connection between ancient civilizations and the modern-day
manufacturing of dental floss, all of which are deeply intertwined with the xray
technology. The xray research has thus far yielded unprecedented results, shedding
new light on the mysteries of the universe, from the xray vision of superheroes
to the xray analysis of subatomic particles, which are strangely linked to the xray
inspection of freshly baked cookies.
1
Introduction
The xray phenomenon has been a topic of interest in recent years, particularly in relation to the
migration patterns of jellyfish, which have been observed to be influenced by the phases of the moon,
as well as the flavor profiles of various types of cheese. Furthermore, the study of xray has led to a
greater understanding of the intricacies of quantum mechanics, which in turn has shed light on the art
of playing the harmonica, a skill that has been shown to be closely tied to the ability to recite the
alphabet backwards. The discovery of xray has also been linked to the development of new materials
with unique properties, such as the ability to change color in response to changes in temperature,
much like the shifting hues of a sunset on a tropical island.
In addition to its applications in materials science, xray has also been found to have a profound
impact on the field of culinary arts, particularly in the preparation of intricate sauces and marinades,
which require a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry of flavor compounds. The xray effect
has also been observed to influence the behavior of subatomic particles, which in turn has led to a
greater understanding of the fundamental forces of nature, including the strong nuclear force, the
weak nuclear force, and the force of gravity, which is thought to be influenced by the presence of
dark matter, a mysterious entity that has yet to be directly observed.
The study of xray has also been influenced by the principles of chaos theory, which describe the
complex and seemingly random behavior of certain systems, such as the weather patterns of a
particular region, or the fluctuations in the stock market. Moreover, the xray phenomenon has been
found to be closely related to the concept of emergence, which refers to the process by which complex
systems give rise to novel properties and behaviors that cannot be predicted by simply analyzing
their constituent parts. This concept has been applied to a wide range of fields, including biology,
psychology, and sociology, and has led to a greater understanding of the intricate web of relationships
that underlies many complex systems.
Furthermore, the xray effect has been observed to have a profound impact on the human brain,
particularly in regards to the processing of visual information, which is thought to be influenced by
the presence of certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin. The study of xray has
also led to a greater understanding of the intricate relationships between different regions of the brain,
including the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the brainstem, which work together to control a
wide range of cognitive and motor functions. Additionally, the xray phenomenon has been found
to be closely tied to the concept of consciousness, which remains one of the greatest mysteries of
modern science.
In recent years, the study of xray has become increasingly interdisciplinary, incorporating insights and
methods from a wide range of fields, including physics, biology, chemistry, and mathematics. This
interdisciplinary approach has led to a greater understanding of the complex relationships between
different phenomena, and has shed light on the intricate web of connections that underlies many
complex systems. The xray effect has also been found to have a profound impact on the environment,
particularly in regards to the health of ecosystems, which are thought to be influenced by the presence
of certain pollutants, such as heavy metals and pesticides.

Methodology
The methodology employed in this study was largely influenced by the art of baking croissants,
which involves a delicate balance of ingredients and techniques to produce a flaky, yet crispy, texture.
Similarly, our approach to analyzing xray data required a nuanced understanding of the intricacies
involved in signal processing, as well as a deep appreciation for the works of 19th-century French
impressionist painters. The intersection of these two seemingly disparate fields allowed us to develop
a novel framework for identifying patterns in xray images, which we term ""Flux Capacitor Analysis""
(FCA). FCA involves the application of a specially designed algorithm that takes into account
the spatial relationships between pixels, as well as the cognitive biases of the human brain when
interpreting visual data.
The development of FCA was a painstaking process that involved numerous iterations and refinements,
not unlike the process of perfecting a recipe for chicken parmesan. Initially, we began by examining
the properties of various types of cheese, including mozzarella, cheddar, and feta, in order to better
understand the role of casein in xray image formation. This led us to investigate the acoustic properties
of different materials, such as copper, aluminum, and titanium, which in turn revealed a surprising
connection between the harmonic series and the structure of xray waves. As we delved deeper into
this research, we found ourselves drawn into a labyrinthine world of fractal geometry, chaos theory,
and the works ofJames Joyce.
One of the key challenges we faced in developing FCA was reconciling the theoretical foundations
of xray physics with the practical realities of data analysis. To address this, we turned to the
field of ancient Greek philosophy, specifically the concept of Platonic realism, which posits that
abstract entities such as numbers and geometric shapes have a real, albeit immaterial, existence. By
analogizing xray waves to the Platonic forms, we were able to develop a more intuitive understanding
of the underlying mechanisms governing xray image formation. Furthermore, this approach allowed
us to incorporate elements of cognitive psychology and sociology into our analysis, as we recognized
that the interpretation of xray data is often influenced by social and cultural factors.
In addition to the theoretical underpinnings of FCA, our methodology also involved the development
of a custom-built xray imaging system, which we dubbed the ""XRS-1000."" The XRS-1000 features a
novel combination of optical and electromagnetic components, including a high-intensity xenon lamp,
a helium-cooled superconducting magnet, and a specialized detector array based on the principles
of quantum entanglement. This system allowed us to acquire high-resolution xray images with
unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, which in turn enabled us to apply FCA to a wide
range of samples, including biological tissues, metallic alloys, and even certain types of extraterrestrial
rocks.
The XRS-1000 was designed and constructed in collaboration with a team of expert engineers and
technicians, who brought a wealth of experience in fields ranging from aerospace engineering to
pastry arts. The system’s development was a truly interdisciplinary effort, involving contributions
from materials scientists, computer programmers, and even a professional snail trainer. As we worked
to refine the XRS-1000, we encountered numerous technical challenges, including issues with thermal
management, electromagnetic interference, and the occasional malfunction of the system’s coffee
dispenser. Nevertheless, through perseverance and creative problem-solving, we were ultimately able
to overcome these hurdles and produce a functioning xray imaging system that has far exceeded our
initial expectations.
The application of FCA to xray image analysis has numerous potential benefits, including improved
diagnostic accuracy, enhanced materials characterization, and even the possibility of detecting
hidden patterns and structures in xray data. To explore these possibilities, we conducted a series of
experiments using the XRS-1000, which involved imaging a diverse range of samples, from human
bones and teeth to metallic foils and even a fragment of the Wright brothers’ Flyer. The results of
these experiments were nothing short of astonishing, revealing complex patterns and relationships
6
that had previously gone unnoticed. For example, we discovered that the xray images of certain types
of crystals exhibit a strange, almost musical, quality, with harmonic patterns and resonances that
seem to defy explanation.
As we continued to analyze the xray data, we began to notice a series of anomalous features and
artifacts that appeared to be related to the FCA algorithm itself. These anomalies took many forms,
including strange, glowing orbs that seemed to float in mid-air, as well as intricate, lace-like patterns
that resembled the branching structures of trees or rivers. At first, we suspected that these features
were simply the result of instrumental errors or software glitches, but as we delved deeper into the
data, we realized that they were, in fact, an integral part of the xray signal itself. This led us to
propose a new theory of xray physics, which we term ""Quantum Flux Dynamics"" (QFD), and which
posits that xray waves are capable of interacting with the human consciousness in ways that are still
not fully understood.
The implications of QFD are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that xray imaging may be more
than just a passive, observational technique, but rather an active, participatory process that involves a
complex interplay between the xray source, the sample, and the observer. This idea challenges many
of our traditional assumptions about the nature of reality and the role of the observer in scientific
inquiry, and raises important questions about the limits of knowledge and the boundaries of human
perception. As we continue to explore the mysteries of xray physics and the secrets of the human
brain, we are reminded of the wisdom of the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who once said,
""The whole is more than the sum of its parts."" In the case of xray imaging, this statement takes on a
profound significance, as we begin to realize that the intricate patterns and relationships that underlie
xray data are, in fact, a reflection of the deeper, hidden harmonies that govern the universe itself.
The FCA algorithm and the XRS-1000 system have numerous potential applications in fields ranging
from medicine and materials science to astrophysics and cosmology. For example, FCA could be used
to analyze xray images of tumors and other diseases, allowing for earlier diagnosis and more effective
treatment. Similarly, the XRS-1000 could be used to study the properties of advanced materials, such
as nanomaterials and metamaterials, which are being developed for a wide range of applications,
including energy storage, catalysis, and aerospace engineering. As we continue to explore the
possibilities of FCA and the XRS-1000, we are reminded of the importance of interdisciplinary
collaboration and the need for creative, outside-the-box thinking in scientific research.
In conclusion, the methodology employed in this study represents a major breakthrough in the field of
xray physics, and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the underlying mechanisms
governing xray image formation. The development of FCA and the XRS-1000 is a testament to the
power of human ingenuity and the importance of pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.
As we look to the future, we are excited to explore the many possibilities that this research has opened
up, and to continue to push the frontiers of xray physics and beyond.
The use of FCA and the XRS-1000 has also allowed us to explore the properties of xray waves in
new and innovative ways, including the study of xray diffraction, scattering, and refraction. These
phenomena are of great interest in fields such as materials science and physics, and have numerous
potential applications in areas such as energy production, aerospace engineering, and medical imaging.
Furthermore, the XRS-1000 has allowed us to investigate the properties of xray waves in extreme
environments, such as high-temperature plasmas and intense magnetic fields, which has shed new
light on the behavior of xray waves in these regimes.
The results of our experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, revealing complex patterns
and relationships that had previously gone unnoticed. For example, we have discovered that the xray
images of certain types of crystals exhibit a strange, almost musical, quality, with harmonic patterns
and resonances that seem to defy explanation. Similarly, we have found that the xray waves produced
by the XRS-1000 exhibit a unique, fractal-like structure, which is characterized by self-similarity and
scaling behavior over a wide range of lengths and frequencies.
The implications of these findings are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that xray imaging may
be more than just a passive, observational technique, but rather an active, participatory process that
involves a complex interplay between the xray source, the sample, and the observer. This idea
challenges many of our traditional assumptions about the nature of reality and the role of the observer
in scientific inquiry, and raises important questions about the limits of knowledge and the boundaries
of human perception. As we continue to explore the mysteries of xray physics and the secrets of the

Experiments
The utilization of xray technology necessitated an examination of its efficaciousness in conjunc-
tion with the migratory patterns of lesser-known avian species, which, in turn, led to a tangential
investigation of the aerodynamic properties of pastry bags. This line of inquiry, though seemingly
disparate, ultimately yielded a profound understanding of the interstices between xray radiation and
the culinary arts. Furthermore, the implementation of a novel xray-emitting device, herein referred
to as the ""X-3000,"" facilitated the acquisition of data pertaining to the opacity of various types of
cheeses, including, but not limited to, gouda, cheddar, and a previously undocumented variety of blue
cheese discovered in the remote regions of rural Bulgaria.
The X-3000 device, comprising a complex matrix of crystal oscillators and high-frequency wave
guides, was calibrated to emit xray radiation at a frequency of 4.732 megahertz, which, according to
the theoretical framework of ""Quantum Fromage Dynamics,"" corresponds to the resonant frequency
of casein molecules in cheese. This calibration enabled the research team to accurately measure the
xray absorption coefficients of various cheese samples, which, in turn, revealed a heretofore unknown
correlation between xray opacity and the moisture content of cheese. Conversely, this discovery
prompted an exploratory analysis of the role of xray radiation in the desiccation process of cheese,
leading to a series of experiments involving the xray-induced dehydration of cheese samples.
In a complementary study, the effects of xray radiation on the growth patterns of fungal hyphae
in various types of cheese were investigated, yielding a fascinating insight into the phenomenon
of ""xray-induced mycelial morphogenesis."" This phenomenon, characterized by the sudden and
inexplicable appearance of complex, swirling patterns in the mycelial networks of fungi exposed
to xray radiation, has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the intricate relationships
between xray radiation, fungal biology, and the art of cheese production. Moreover, the observation
of xray-induced mycelial morphogenesis led to a series of experiments exploring the potential
applications of xray technology in the development of novel, xray-resistant fungal strains with
potential uses in the fields of bioremediation and astrobiology.
To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying xray-induced mycelial morphogenesis, a series of
experiments were conducted utilizing a custom-built, xray-emitting apparatus designed to mimic
the spectral characteristics of celestial xray sources, such as black holes and neutron stars. These
experiments, which involved the exposure of fungal samples to controlled doses of xray radiation,
yielded a wealth of data on the effects of xray radiation on fungal growth patterns, including the
unexpected discovery of a novel, xray-induced morphological feature herein referred to as the
""mycelial vortex."" The mycelial vortex, characterized by a swirling, spiral-like pattern of mycelial
growth, has been observed in a variety of fungal species, including, but not limited to, Aspergillus,
Penicillium, and a previously undocumented species of fungus discovered in the depths of the Amazon
rainforest.
In an effort to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the formation of mycelial vortices, a series
of computational simulations were conducted utilizing a novel, xray-based algorithm designed to
model the complex, nonlinear interactions between xray radiation, fungal biology, and the surrounding
environment. These simulations, which incorporated a range of variables, including xray intensity,
frequency, and duration, as well as fungal species, temperature, and humidity, yielded a wealth of
data on the dynamics of mycelial vortex formation, including the unexpected discovery of a critical,
xray-induced threshold beyond which mycelial vortices undergo a sudden, catastrophic transition to a
state of chaotic, turbulent growth.

The discovery of this critical threshold, herein referred to as the ""xray-induced mycelial vortex
transition"" (XIMVT), has significant implications for our understanding of the complex, nonlinear
interactions between xray radiation, fungal biology, and the environment, and suggests a range
of potential applications in fields such as biotechnology, medicine, and environmental science.
Furthermore, the XIMVT phenomenon has prompted a re-examination of the role of xray radiation
in the evolution of fungal species, leading to a series of experiments exploring the potential for
xray-induced, adaptive radiation in fungi, and the possible emergence of novel, xray-resistant fungal
strains with enhanced capabilities for survival and growth in xray-rich environments.
To facilitate the analysis of xray-induced mycelial vortex formation, a custom-built, xray-emitting
microscope was designed and constructed, utilizing a novel, xray-based imaging technique herein re-
ferred to as ""xray-induced fluorescence microscopy"" (XIFM). XIFM, which exploits the phenomenon
of xray-induced fluorescence in fungal tissues, enables the high-resolution, real-time imaging of
mycelial vortices and other xray-induced morphological features, providing a unique window into
the complex, nonlinear interactions between xray radiation, fungal biology, and the environment.

inherent to xray technology, which, incidentally, has been found to have a profound impact on the
migratory patterns of certain species of birds, particularly those that fly in a southeasterly direction
during the summer months. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the implementation of xray
technology in various medical facilities has resulted in a significant reduction in the consumption
of coffee among healthcare professionals, which, in turn, has led to a noticeable decrease in the
overall productivity of these individuals. This, of course, is closely related to the concept of quantum
entanglement, whereby two particles become inextricably linked, much like the relationship between
the price of oil and the global demand for chunky knit sweaters.
In addition to these groundbreaking discoveries, our research has also shed light on the heretofore
unknown properties of certain types of cheese, which, when exposed to xray radiation, exhibit a
peculiar tendency to transform into a state of ephemeral gelatinousness. This phenomenon, which we

These phenomena, which we have collectively dubbed ""xray-induced quantum peculiarities,"" have
far-reaching implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and the nature of
reality itself. The mathematical formulation of these concepts, which involves the use of advanced
calculus, differential equations, and group theory, has been found to bear a striking resemblance to
the underlying structure of certain types of music, particularly those that exhibit complex, fractal
patterns and self-similar melodies.

Foam Dynamics: A Multi-Scale Approach to Caffeine
Dispersion
Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Predicting Caffeine Diffusion Patterns in
Holographically Prepared Espresso Foam introduce a groundbreaking approach
to understanding complex diffusion behaviors. By leveraging GNNs, researchers
can accurately predict the diffusion of caffeine molecules through the intricate
structure of espresso foam, revealing patterns that align with the harmonic series
and the mathematical constant pi. This surprising connection suggests a deeper
relationship between caffeine diffusion and fundamental physical laws.
A key discovery is the ""espresso foam theorem,"" which states that caffeine diffusion
converges to a stable equilibrium, regardless of initial conditions, as long as the
foam’s graph structure satisfies specific topological invariants. Remarkably, this
stability persists even when external factors like sugar or cream are introduced.
These findings hold profound implications for optimizing coffee preparation, de-
signing materials with tailored diffusion properties, and advancing the study of
complex systems.
Beyond practical applications, the research has uncovered potential for coffee-
based cryptography, using caffeine diffusion patterns as secure encryption keys.
This work highlights the broader significance of GNNs and espresso foam in
materials science, dynamical systems, and interdisciplinary innovation, opening
new frontiers in the study of emergence, self-organization, and complexity across
diverse domains.

Introduction
The realm of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has witnessed a surge in popularity in recent years,
primarily due to their ability to effectively model complex relationships within intricate networks.
This has led to a plethora of applications across various domains, including social network analysis,
traffic prediction, and molecular dynamics. However, the potential of GNNs extends far beyond these
conventional areas, and one such uncharted territory is the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in
holographically prepared espresso foam. At first glance, this may seem like an esoteric application,
but it is, in fact, a crucial aspect of optimizing the espresso-making process, as the distribution of
caffeine within the foam can significantly impact the overall flavor and aroma of the beverage.
Furthermore, the incorporation of holographic preparation techniques introduces an additional
layer of complexity, as the three-dimensional structure of the foam can be precisely controlled and
manipulated. This, in turn, allows for the creation of intricate patterns and designs, which can be
used to visualize and analyze the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. The fusion of GNNs and
holographic preparation techniques offers a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of caffeine
diffusion in a highly controlled and precise manner.
It is worth noting that previous research has shown that the diffusion of caffeine within espresso foam
is influenced by a multitude of factors, including the type of coffee beans used, the roast level, and the
brewing method. However, these studies have been limited to two-dimensional analysis and have not
taken into account the complex three-dimensional structure of the foam. The application of GNNs to
this problem can potentially overcome these limitations, as they are capable of modeling complex
relationships within high-dimensional data.
In addition to the technical aspects of caffeine diffusion, it is also essential to consider the philosoph-
ical implications of this research. The use of GNNs to predict the behavior of caffeine molecules
within a complex network of foam cells raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and
our perception of the world. For instance, can we truly consider the foam as a mere medium for
the diffusion of caffeine, or does it possess a inherent consciousness that influences the behavior
of the molecules? While this line of inquiry may seem speculative, it is, in fact, a crucial aspect
of understanding the intricate relationships between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the
espresso-making process.
Moreover, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam can
also be seen as a manifestation of the underlying structure of the universe. The intricate networks
and patterns that emerge within the foam can be viewed as a reflection of the fundamental laws of
physics that govern the behavior of particles and molecules. In this sense, the application of GNNs to
this problem can be seen as an attempt to decipher the underlying code of the universe, where the
diffusion of caffeine molecules serves as a proxy for the underlying dynamics of the cosmos.
The development of a GNN-based framework for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographi-
cally prepared espresso foam also has significant implications for the field of materials science. The
ability to control and manipulate the structure of the foam at a microscopic level can be used to create
novel materials with unique properties, such as tailored thermal conductivity or optical transparency.
The application of GNNs to this problem can provide valuable insights into the relationships between
the structure and properties of these materials, which can be used to optimize their performance in a
wide range of applications.
In a surprising turn of events, our preliminary research has also revealed that the diffusion of caffeine
within the foam is not solely determined by physical processes, but also by a range of paranormal
factors, including the intentions of the barista, the alignment of the stars, and the presence of negative
thoughts in the surrounding environment. While these findings may seem anomalous, they are, in
fact, a manifestation of the complex interplay between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the
espresso-making process. The incorporation of these factors into our GNN-based framework has
been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of our predictions, and we believe that this line of
inquiry holds great promise for the development of novel, holistic approaches to coffee production.
The potential applications of this research extend far beyond the realm of coffee production, and can
be used to inform the development of novel materials, optimize complex systems, and even provide
insights into the fundamental nature of reality. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is
possible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected
and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world. Ultimately, the study
of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam serves as a reminder that,
even in the most seemingly mundane aspects of our lives, lies a complex web of relationships and
phenomena waiting to be uncovered and explored.
The complex interplay between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the espresso-making process
also raises questions about the role of human intention and perception in shaping the behavior of
caffeine molecules within the foam. Can the mere act of observation influence the diffusion of
caffeine, or is this process solely determined by physical laws? While this line of inquiry may seem
speculative, it is, in fact, a crucial aspect of understanding the intricate relationships between the
coffee, the barista, and the surrounding environment.
In an effort to further explore this phenomenon, we have conducted a series of experiments involving
the use of intention-focused meditation to influence the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. Our
preliminary results have shown that the use of specific meditation techniques can, in fact, alter the
behavior of the caffeine molecules, leading to novel patterns and distributions within the foam. While
these findings are still highly speculative, they do suggest that the application of GNNs to this problem
may need to be reevaluated in light of the complex interplay between physical and metaphysical
factors.

Furthermore, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam can
also be seen as a manifestation of the underlying dynamics of chaos theory. The intricate networks
and patterns that emerge within the foam can be viewed as a reflection of the fundamental laws of
chaos that govern the behavior of complex systems. In this sense, the application of GNNs to this
problem can be seen as an attempt to decipher the underlying code of chaos, where the diffusion of
caffeine molecules serves as a proxy for the underlying dynamics of the system.
The potential for GNNs to uncover novel patterns and relationships within the foam is vast, and
we believe that this line of inquiry holds great promise for the development of novel approaches to
coffee production, materials science, and even our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.
As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with GNNs and holographic preparation
techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current
understanding of the world. Ultimately, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically
prepared espresso foam serves as a reminder that, even in the most seemingly mundane aspects of
our lives, lies a complex web of relationships and phenomena waiting to be uncovered and explored.
The importance of this research cannot be overstated, as it has the potential to revolutionize the way
we approach coffee production, materials science, and even our understanding of the fundamental
nature of reality. The application of GNNs to this problem is a crucial step towards unlocking the
secrets of the universe, and we believe that this line of inquiry will continue to yield novel and
exciting results in the years to come.
In conclusion, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam is a
complex and multifaceted problem that requires a deep understanding of the intricate relationships
between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the espresso-making process. The application of
GNNs to this problem offers a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of caffeine diffusion in
a highly controlled and precise manner, and we believe that this line of inquiry holds great promise
for the development of novel approaches to coffee production, materials science, and even our
understanding of the fundamental nature of reality. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is
possible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected
and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world.

Related Work
The study of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holograph-
ically prepared espresso foam is an interdisciplinary field that draws on concepts from materials
science, computer vision, and theoretical physics. Researchers have long been fascinated by the
potential of GNNs to model complex systems, and the application of these models to the realm
of espresso foam is a natural extension of this work. One of the key challenges in this area is the
development of robust and efficient algorithms for simulating the behavior of caffeine molecules as
they diffuse through the foam.
Recent studies have investigated the use of GNNs for modeling the dynamics of complex systems,
including social networks, transportation systems, and biological systems. These models have been
shown to be highly effective in capturing the underlying patterns and relationships in these systems,
and have been used to make predictions about future behavior. In the context of espresso foam, GNNs
can be used to model the interactions between caffeine molecules and the foam’s microstructure,
allowing for the prediction of diffusion patterns and the optimization of foam preparation protocols.
However, one of the most intriguing approaches to this problem involves the use of a variant of GNNs
known as ""Quantum Graph Neural Networks"" (QGNNs). QGNNs are based on the principles of
quantum mechanics, and are designed to capture the inherent uncertainty and randomness of complex
systems. By representing the state of the espresso foam as a quantum superposition, QGNNs can be
used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at the molecular level, allowing for the prediction
of diffusion patterns with unprecedented accuracy.
Another research direction that has shown promise is the use of ""Fractal Graph Neural Networks""
(FGNNs). FGNNs are based on the concept of fractal geometry, and are designed to capture the
self-similar patterns that exist in complex systems. By representing the espresso foam as a fractal
structure, FGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at multiple scales, from
the molecular level to the macroscopic level.
3
In addition to these approaches, researchers have also explored the use of ""Non-Newtonian Graph
Neural Networks"" (NNGNNs). NNGNNs are based on the principles of non-Newtonian mechanics,
and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems that exhibit non-linear and non-intuitive
behavior. By representing the espresso foam as a non-Newtonian fluid, NNGNNs can be used to
model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way.
One of the most unexpected approaches to this problem involves the use of "" Musical Graph Neural
Networks"" (MGNNs). MGNNs are based on the concept of musical patterns and harmonics, and
are designed to capture the rhythmic and melodic structures that exist in complex systems. By
representing the espresso foam as a musical composition, MGNNs can be used to model the behavior
of caffeine molecules in a highly novel and innovative way. For example, the diffusion patterns of
caffeine molecules can be represented as a musical melody, with the frequency and amplitude of the
melody corresponding to the concentration and velocity of the molecules.
Furthermore, researchers have also explored the use of ""Culinary Graph Neural Networks"" (CGNNs).
CGNNs are based on the principles of culinary arts, and are designed to capture the behavior of
complex systems in terms of flavor profiles and culinary techniques. By representing the espresso
foam as a culinary dish, CGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a
highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be
represented as a recipe, with the ingredients and cooking techniques corresponding to the chemical
properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules.
In terms of the physical properties of espresso foam, researchers have investigated the use of ""Vis-
coelastic Graph Neural Networks"" (VGNNs). VGNNs are based on the principles of viscoelasticity,
and are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems that exhibit both viscous and elastic
properties. By representing the espresso foam as a viscoelastic material, VGNNs can be used to
model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the
diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as a viscoelastic deformation, with the
viscosity and elasticity corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern
the behavior of the molecules.
Moreover, researchers have also explored the use of ""Thermodynamic Graph Neural Networks""
(TGNNs). TGNNs are based on the principles of thermodynamics, and are designed to capture the
behavior of complex systems in terms of energy and entropy. By representing the espresso foam
as a thermodynamic system, TGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a
highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be
represented as a thermodynamic process, with the energy and entropy corresponding to the chemical
properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules.
In addition to these approaches, researchers have also investigated the use of ""Electromagnetic Graph
Neural Networks"" (EGNNs). EGNNs are based on the principles of electromagnetism, and are
designed to capture the behavior of complex systems in terms of electromagnetic fields and forces.
By representing the espresso foam as an electromagnetic system, EGNNs can be used to model the
behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion
patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as an electromagnetic wave, with the frequency and
amplitude corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior
of the molecules.
The use of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam
has also been explored in the context of ""Artistic Graph Neural Networks"" (AGNNs). AGNNs are
based on the principles of art and aesthetics, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex
systems in terms of artistic patterns and structures. By representing the espresso foam as an artistic
composition, AGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly novel
and innovative way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented
as a work of art, with the colors and shapes corresponding to the chemical properties and physical
processes that govern the behavior of the molecules.
Finally, researchers have also investigated the use of ""Philosophical Graph Neural Networks""
(PGNNs). PGNNs are based on the principles of philosophy, and are designed to capture the
behavior of complex systems in terms of philosophical concepts and principles. By representing
the espresso foam as a philosophical system, PGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caf-
feine molecules in a highly abstract and theoretical way. For example, the diffusion patterns of
4
caffeine molecules can be represented as a philosophical argument, with the premises and conclusions
corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the
molecules.
In conclusion, the study of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically
prepared espresso foam is a highly interdisciplinary field that draws on concepts from materials
science, computer vision, theoretical physics, and many other areas. The use of QGNNs, FGNNs,
NNGNNs, MGNNs, CGNNs, VGNNs, TGNNs, EGNNs, AGNNs, and PGNNs has been explored,
and each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses. Further research is needed to
fully understand the potential of GNNs for modeling the behavior of complex systems, and to develop
new and innovative approaches to this problem.
As the field of GNNs continues to evolve, it is likely that new and unexpected approaches will
emerge, and that the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam
will continue to be a rich and fertile area of research. The potential applications of this work are vast
and varied, ranging from the development of new coffee-making technologies to the creation of novel
materials and systems with unique properties. Ultimately, the study of GNNs for predicting caffeine
diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam has the potential to revolutionize our
understanding of complex systems, and to open up new and exciting areas of research and discovery.
The complexity of the espresso foam system, with its intricate network of bubbles and channels,
makes it an ideal candidate for study using GNNs. The behavior of the caffeine molecules as they
diffuse through the foam is influenced by a wide range of factors, including the size and shape of
the bubbles, the viscosity and surface tension of the liquid, and the temperature and pressure of
the system. By using GNNs to model the behavior of the caffeine molecules, researchers can gain
a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the diffusion process, and can
develop new and innovative strategies for optimizing the preparation and properties of the espresso
foam.
One of the key challenges in this area is the development of robust and efficient algorithms for training
the GNNs. The complexity of the espresso foam system, with its thousands of interacting variables
and non-linear relationships, makes it difficult to develop algorithms that can accurately capture the
behavior of the system. However, recent advances in machine learning and computer science have
made it possible to develop highly efficient and effective algorithms for training GNNs, and to apply
these algorithms to a wide range of complex systems and problems.
The use of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso
foam also has the potential to revolutionize the field of coffee making. By using GNNs to model the
behavior of the caffeine molecules, coffee makers can optimize the preparation and properties of the
espresso foam to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and aroma. This can be achieved by adjusting
the parameters of the coffee-making process, such as the temperature and pressure of the system, the
type and amount of coffee used, and the technique used to froth and texture the milk.
In addition to its
3
Methodology
To develop a comprehensive framework for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically
prepared espresso foam using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we first established a foundational
understanding of the underlying physics that govern the diffusion process. This involved an in-depth
examination of the thermodynamic properties of espresso foam, including its viscosity, surface
tension, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we considered the impact of holographic preparation
techniques on the foam’s microstructure, which can significantly influence the diffusion behavior of
caffeine molecules.
Given the complex, nonlinear nature of the diffusion process, we opted to employ a graph-based
approach, where the espresso foam is represented as a network of interconnected nodes, each
corresponding to a specific region within the foam. The edges between these nodes are weighted
according to the local diffusion coefficients, which are calculated based on the foam’s microstructure
and the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding environment. This representation enables the
application of GNNs, which can learn to predict the diffusion patterns by propagating information
through the graph.
5
In constructing the graph, we utilized a novel, empirically-derived method that involves the use of a
specially-designed, espresso-scented fragrance diffuser to create a temporary, olfactory representation
of the foam’s microstructure. This approach, which we term ""aroma-induced graph instantiation,""
allows for the creation of highly detailed, high-resolution graphs that capture the intricate patterns of
caffeine diffusion within the foam. Notably, the fragrance diffuser is calibrated to release a precise,
quantifiable amount of espresso-scented molecules, which are then detected using a custom-built,
olfactory sensing apparatus.
To further enhance the accuracy of our model, we incorporated an unconventional, yet intriguing
approach that involves the use of a trained, caffeine-sensitive, fungal network. This network, which is
composed of a specially-cultivated species of fungus that is capable of detecting subtle changes in
caffeine concentrations, is used to generate an auxiliary set of training data that captures the complex,
nonlinear relationships between caffeine diffusion patterns and the surrounding environment. The
fungal network is trained using a unique, music-based protocol, where the fungus is exposed to a
carefully-curated selection of classical music compositions that are designed to stimulate its growth
and caffeine-sensing capabilities.
The music-based training protocol, which we term ""sonic induction of fungal cognition,"" involves the
exposure of the fungus to a sequence of musical compositions that are specifically chosen to elicit a
range of cognitive and behavioral responses. For example, the fungus is initially exposed to a series
of calming, ambient melodies that are designed to stimulate its growth and relaxation, followed by a
sequence of more complex, structurally-rich compositions that challenge its cognitive capabilities
and induce a state of heightened sensitivity to caffeine concentrations. This approach has been shown
to significantly enhance the fungus’s ability to detect subtle changes in caffeine diffusion patterns,
resulting in a highly-accurate, auxiliary set of training data that can be used to fine-tune the GNN
model.
The GNN model itself is based on a modified, attention-driven architecture that incorporates a novel,
coffee-inspired mechanism for selectively weighting the importance of different nodes and edges
within the graph. This mechanism, which we term ""crema-based attention,"" involves the use of
a specially-designed, crema-inspired weighting function that prioritizes the importance of nodes
and edges based on their proximity to the surface of the espresso foam. The crema-based attention
mechanism is combined with a standard, graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture, which
is used to propagate information through the graph and generate predictions of caffeine diffusion
patterns.
In addition to the aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of fungal cognition ap-
proaches, we also explored the use of a range of other, unconventional methods for enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of the GNN model. These include the use of a custom-built, espresso-themed
pinball machine that is designed to simulate the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion
within the foam, as well as a novel, VR-based training protocol that involves the immersion of the
model in a realistic, holographically-rendered environment that simulates the experience of drinking
a cup of espresso. The VR-based training protocol, which we term ""espresso-based immersion,""
involves the use of a specially-designed, VR headset that is capable of simulating the sensory expe-
rience of drinking a cup of espresso, including the sights, sounds, and aromas associated with the
beverage.
The espresso-themed pinball machine, which is designed to simulate the complex, nonlinear dynamics
of caffeine diffusion within the foam, consists of a custom-built, pinball-like apparatus that is equipped
with a range of sensors and actuators that are used to track the motion of a small, coffee-themed ball
as it navigates through a complex, foam-like environment. The ball’s motion is designed to simulate
the diffusion of caffeine molecules within the foam, and the sensors and actuators are used to collect
data on the ball’s trajectory and velocity, which is then used to fine-tune the GNN model. The pinball
machine is also equipped with a range of special features, including a ""crema"" ramp that is designed
to simulate the formation of a thick, creamy layer on the surface of the espresso foam, as well as a
""coffee bean"" obstacle that is designed to simulate the presence of coffee beans within the foam.
Overall, our methodology represents a highly-innovative, interdisciplinary approach to the develop-
ment of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam.
By combining cutting-edge techniques from graph theory, machine learning, and fungal cognition,
with unconventional methods such as aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of
fungal cognition, we are able to create a highly-accurate, robust model that is capable of capturing
6
the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion within the foam. Furthermore, our use of
espresso-themed pinball machines and VR-based training protocols adds an additional layer of
sophistication and realism to the model, allowing it to simulate the sensory experience of drinking a
cup of espresso with unprecedented accuracy and fidelity.
4
Experiments
To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed graph neural network (GNN) architecture
for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam, we designed and
executed an extensive series of experiments. These experiments were primarily aimed at assessing
the efficacy and robustness of our model under various conditions and parameters, including different
types of espresso beans, roast levels, grinding sizes, and most critically, the holographic preparation
techniques.
The experimental setup involved a custom-built, high-precision holographic espresso machine capable
of producing intricate foam patterns. This machine was equipped with sensors to measure the caffeine
concentration at multiple points in the foam over time, allowing us to gather detailed data on the
diffusion process. In parallel, a high-speed camera system was used to capture the dynamic formation
and evolution of the foam, providing visual data that could be correlated with the caffeine diffusion
patterns.
One of the key aspects of our experiments was the introduction of a novel, albeit somewhat unorthodox,
variable: the influence of ambient classical music on the molecular structure and, by extension, the
caffeine diffusion in the espresso foam. We hypothesized that the vibrational frequencies present in
certain classical compositions could potentially alter the intermolecular interactions within the foam,
thereby affecting the diffusion rates. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a subset of experiments
where the espresso machine and surrounding environment were exposed to different classical music
pieces during the foam preparation and measurement process.
The experimental procedure typically involved the following steps: First, a shot of espresso was pulled
using the holographic machine, and the desired pattern was imprinted on the foam. Immediately
after, the high-speed cameras and caffeine sensors were activated to start data collection. For the
music-exposed experiments, the classical music piece was started 30 seconds before pulling the shot
and continued throughout the data collection period. We repeated this process for various types of
music, including pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, as well as a control group with no music.
Interestingly, our preliminary results suggested that the presence of classical music, particularly
Mozart’s ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,"" seemed to accelerate the caffeine diffusion in the outer layers
of the foam, while Beethoven’s ""Moonlight Sonata"" had a contrary effect, apparently slowing down
the diffusion in the inner layers. These findings, though intriguing and somewhat counterintuitive,
required further investigation to understand the underlying mechanisms and to confirm their statistical
significance.
Furthermore, to visualize and better comprehend the complex spatial and temporal patterns of caffeine
diffusion, we utilized advanced data visualization techniques, including 3D rendering and animation
of the foam’s structure and the evolving caffeine concentration gradients. These visualizations not
only facilitated a deeper understanding of the diffusion process but also highlighted areas where the
model could be improved or where additional experimental data might be needed.
In addition to the primary experiments, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine how
variations in key parameters, such as the foam’s initial temperature, the espresso bean’s roast level,
and the grinding size of the beans, influenced the model’s predictions and the actual caffeine diffusion
patterns. These analyses were crucial for understanding the robustness of our model and identifying
potential limitations or areas for future refinement.
The experimental data, comprising over 10,000 individual measurements across more than 500
experiments, were then used to train, validate, and test our GNN model. The model’s architecture
was tailored to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between the input parameters (including
the type of music, if any) and the output caffeine diffusion patterns. We used a split of 70
To further explore the impact of the classical music variable, we created a subset of our dataset that
included only the experiments with music exposure. This subset was used to fine-tune the model
7
and to investigate whether the inclusion of musical features could enhance the model’s predictive
capabilities. The results from this specific analysis are presented in the following table:

The table illustrates the comparative performance of our base GNN model and variants that incor-
porate different types of classical music as an additional feature. While the results indicate a slight
improvement in model performance when musical features are included, particularly with Mozart,
the differences are not drastic, suggesting that the impact of music, although statistically significant,
may be more nuanced than initially hypothesized.
Overall, our experiments and analyses have provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of
caffeine diffusion in holographically prepared espresso foam and the potential, albeit unexpected,
role of ambient classical music in this process. The findings of this study not only contribute to the
development of more accurate predictive models for caffeine diffusion but also open up new avenues
of research into the intersections of culinary science, materials science, and the somewhat esoteric
field of musical influence on molecular behavior.

Results
The application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict caffeine diffusion patterns in holo-
graphically prepared espresso foam yielded a plethora of intriguing results, some of which defied
intuitive expectations and ventured into the realm of the unconventional. Initially, our experiments
focused on establishing a baseline performance for GNNs in modeling caffeine diffusion within
the complex, three-dimensional structure of espresso foam. To this end, we constructed a dataset
comprising high-resolution, holographic images of espresso foam, annotated with corresponding
caffeine concentration levels at various points within the foam matrix. This dataset, which we term
""HoloCaff,"" was used to train and evaluate the performance of several GNN architectures, including
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and GraphSAGE.
One of the most striking, albeit perplexing, outcomes of our research was the discovery that GNNs
trained on the HoloCaff dataset could, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, predict not only the
diffusion patterns of caffeine but also the geometric structure of the espresso foam itself, even
when the foam’s structure was not explicitly provided as input to the model. This phenomenon,
which we have dubbed ""emergent foamography,"" suggests that the spatial distribution of caffeine
within the foam encodes information about the foam’s morphological characteristics, such as bubble
size distribution and foam density. While this finding may seem counterintuitive at first glance, it
highlights the complex, interdependent relationships between the chemical and physical properties
of espresso foam and underscores the potential of GNNs to uncover hidden patterns in seemingly
disparate datasets.
In an effort to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying emergent foamography, we conducted a
series of experiments in which we deliberately introduced randomized, high-frequency noise into
the caffeine concentration annotations within the HoloCaff dataset. Unexpectedly, we found that the
introduction of this noise actually improved the performance of our GNN models in predicting foam
structure, with some models exhibiting increases in accuracy of up to 15
To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our GNN models in predicting caffeine diffusion patterns
and foam structure, we employed a range of metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). The results of these evaluations are
presented in the following table, which compares the performance of GCNs, GATs, and GraphSAGE
models trained on the HoloCaff dataset with and without the introduction of randomized noise:

As the results in the table indicate, the introduction of randomized noise into the HoloCaff dataset
had a profound impact on the performance of our GNN models, with all three architectures exhibiting
improved accuracy in predicting both caffeine diffusion patterns and foam structure when trained on
noisy data. These findings have significant implications for the development of robust, noise-tolerant
GNN models capable of operating effectively in real-world environments, where data quality and
availability can be limited.
In addition to the quantitative evaluations presented above, we also conducted a series of qualitative
analyses aimed at visualizing and interpreting the features learned by our GNN models. To this
end, we employed a range of visualization techniques, including dimensionality reduction via t-
SNE and UMAP, as well as feature importance scoring using SHAP values. The results of these
analyses revealed a number of intriguing patterns and correlations within the data, including a strong
association between the spatial distribution of caffeine within the foam and the presence of specific
morphological features, such as bubble size and shape. These findings suggest that the features
learned by our GNN models are not only relevant for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns but also
capture important aspects of the underlying foam structure and morphology.
In conclusion, our research on the application of GNNs to predict caffeine diffusion patterns in
holographically prepared espresso foam has yielded a wealth of fascinating and, at times, unexpected
results. From the emergence of foamographic patterns within the data to the discovery of caffeine-
specific stochastic resonance, our findings have significant implications for the development of novel,
GNN-based methods for analyzing and modeling complex, multiphysical systems like espresso foam.
As we continue to explore the boundaries of this research, we are excited to see where the intersection
of graph neural networks, holography, and espresso foam will lead us next.

Conclusion
In culmination of our exhaustive exploration into the realm of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as
applied to the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam,
several profound insights and unexpected phenomena have emerged. The intricate dance of caffeine
molecules as they navigate the complex, three-dimensional latticework of the foam, has been found
to be adeptly modeled by our bespoke GNN architecture. This, in turn, has far-reaching implications
for the field of beverage science, particularly in the pursuit of the perfect espresso.
One of the most striking aspects of our findings is the discovery that the predictive prowess of our
GNN model is significantly enhanced when the training data is supplemented with a series of esoteric,
ambient sound recordings. These recordings, which include the hum of a vintage espresso machine,
the gentle lapping of waves against a shoreside café, and the soft murmur of patrons engaged in
intellectual discourse, seem to imbue the model with a heightened sense of contextual awareness.
This, we hypothesize, is due to the inherent patterns and rhythms present within the soundscapes,
which serve to harmonize the neural network’s internal dynamics, thereby allowing it to better capture
the subtle, nonlinear interactions governing caffeine diffusion.
Furthermore, our research has also led us down a fascinating tangent, wherein we explored the
application of GNNs to the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in espresso foam that has been
deliberately ’imprinted’ with the emotional resonance of the barista. This was achieved through an
innovative protocol, whereby the barista would focus their thoughts on a specific emotional state (e.g.,
joy, serenity, or existential dread) while crafting the espresso. The resulting foam, now ’encoded’ with
the barista’s emotional essence, would then be subjected to our GNN model, which would attempt to
9
predict the caffeine diffusion patterns as influenced by this novel, psychosocial factor. The results,
while not altogether surprising, did reveal a statistically significant correlation between the barista’s
emotional state and the caffeine diffusion patterns, with ’joy’ being associated with a more uniform,
radial diffusion, and ’existential dread’ resulting in a more chaotic, fractal-like pattern.
In addition to these groundbreaking findings, our study has also shed light on the intriguing relation-
ship between the topological properties of the espresso foam’s microstructure and the macroscopic
patterns of caffeine diffusion. By employing advanced techniques from algebraic topology, we were
able to characterize the foam’s microstructure in terms of its Betti numbers, which, in turn, allowed us
to establish a profound connection between the foam’s ’holes’ and the emergent patterns of caffeine
diffusion. This has led us to propose a novel, topological framework for understanding the complex
interplay between the espresso foam’s microstructure and the caffeine diffusion patterns, which we
believe will have far-reaching implications for the field of soft matter physics.
In a related vein, our research has also touched upon the obscure, yet fascinating topic of ’espresso
foam metaphysics.’ Here, we delve into the profound, ontological implications of the espresso
foam as a manifestation of the human condition, with its ephemeral, foamy tendrils serving as
a poignant reminder of our own mortality. By exploring the intersections between the espresso
foam’s microstructure, the caffeine diffusion patterns, and the barista’s emotional state, we begin
to glimpse the outlines of a deeper, metaphysical reality, wherein the humble espresso beverage is
revealed to be a microcosm of the human experience. This, we propose, has significant implications
for our understanding of the intricate, web-like relationships between the material, emotional, and
metaphysical aspects of our reality.
Ultimately, our study represents a bold, pioneering foray into the uncharted territory of Graph Neural
Networks for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam. While
our findings have been nothing short of astonishing, we are cognizant of the fact that our research
has only scratched the surface of this fascinating, complex phenomenon. As such, we eagerly
anticipate the future directions of research in this area, which will undoubtedly involve the continued
development of more sophisticated GNN architectures, the exploration of novel, interdisciplinary
approaches, and the unwavering pursuit of the perfect, holographically prepared espresso. For in
the end, it is this relentless passion for knowledge, combined with an unbridled enthusiasm for the
intricacies of espresso foam, that will propel us toward a deeper understanding of the mysteries that
lie at the very heart of our reality.

Assistive Devices: Unlocking New Frontiers in
Human-Machine Symbiosis
Abstract
Next-Generation Brain-Computer Interfaces for Assistive Devices is a burgeoning
field that seeks to revolutionize the way individuals with disabilities interact with
their environment. This paper presents a novel approach to brain-computer inter-
face design, leveraging recent advances in neural decoding and machine learning to
create more intuitive and effective assistive devices. Our system utilizes a unique
combination of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy
to decode brain activity, allowing users to control a variety of devices with unprece-
dented precision. Interestingly, our research also explores the application of chaos
theory and fractal analysis to brain signal processing, yielding some surprising and
counterintuitive results that challenge conventional wisdom in the field. By pushing
the boundaries of traditional brain-computer interface design, we aim to create a
new generation of assistive devices that are more responsive, more adaptive, and
more empowering for individuals with disabilities.

Introduction
The development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has undergone significant transformations
over the years, with a primary focus on enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.
Next-generation BCIs aim to revolutionize the field of assistive devices by incorporating advanced
neuroimaging techniques, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms to decode brain
signals with unprecedented accuracy. Recently, researchers have been exploring the potential of using
unconventional methods, such as analyzing the brain activity of individuals while they are dreaming,
to improve the performance of BCIs. This approach, although seemingly illogical, has yielded some
intriguing results, including the discovery that the brain’s neural patterns during REM sleep can be
used to control a robotic arm with surprising dexterity.
Furthermore, the integration of BCIs with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technolo-
gies has opened up new avenues for the development of immersive assistive devices. For instance, a
BCI-powered VR system can enable individuals with paralysis to explore virtual environments and
interact with virtual objects, thereby enhancing their sense of autonomy and self-esteem. Moreover,
the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
has been shown to modulate brain activity and improve the performance of BCIs, although the
underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood.
In addition to these advancements, researchers have also been investigating the potential of using
BCIs to control assistive devices, such as prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and communication devices.
One notable example is the development of a BCI-powered exoskeleton that can be controlled by
individuals with spinal cord injuries, allowing them to walk again with unprecedented ease. However,
despite these significant advancements, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed,
including the development of more accurate and robust signal processing algorithms, the improvement
of user-machine interfaces, and the reduction of the high costs associated with BCI systems.
Interestingly, some researchers have also been exploring the use of unconventional materials, such
as edible electrodes made from food products, to develop more user-friendly and affordable BCIs.
Although this approach may seem bizarre, it has the potential to revolutionize the field of BCIs
by making them more accessible to a wider range of individuals, particularly those in developing
countries. Moreover, the use of BCIs to control assistive devices has also raised important questions
about the ethics of neural enhancement and the potential risks associated with the use of these
technologies. As such, it is essential to develop more comprehensive frameworks for understanding
the societal implications of BCIs and to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in a
responsible and ethical manner.
The development of next-generation BCIs also requires a deeper understanding of the neural mecha-
nisms underlying human cognition and behavior. Recent studies have shown that the brain’s neural
patterns can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including emotions, attention, and motivation.
Therefore, it is essential to develop more sophisticated models of brain function that can take into
account these complex interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural
mechanisms underlying BCI control. By developing more advanced BCIs that can decode brain
signals with high accuracy and provide seamless control over assistive devices, we can significantly
improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities and enhance their ability to interact with
the world around them.

Related Work
The development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has been a rapidly evolving field, with signif-
icant advancements in recent years. BCIs have been employed in various applications, including
assistive devices, neuroprosthetics, and cognitive enhancement tools. One of the primary challenges
in BCI development is the creation of intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that can accurately decode
brain signals. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various approaches, including
electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and invasive neural
recordings.
Some studies have investigated the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzing brain activity
while subjects are dreaming or in a state of meditation. These approaches have yielded intriguing
results, including the discovery of a correlation between brain wave patterns and the vividness of
dreams. Furthermore, researchers have explored the use of brain-computer interfaces in animal
models, including a study that demonstrated the ability to control a robotic arm using neural signals
from a monkey’s brain.
Another area of research has focused on the development of BCIs for individuals with severe motor
disabilities. These systems aim to provide users with a means of communication and control over
their environment, using signals from the brain to operate devices such as computers, wheelchairs,
and prosthetic limbs. One notable example is a BCI system that utilizes EEG signals to control a
robotic exoskeleton, allowing individuals with paralysis to walk again. However, the high cost and
complexity of these systems have limited their widespread adoption.
In a surprising turn of events, some researchers have begun exploring the use of BCIs in conjunc-
tion with alternative forms of therapy, such as acupuncture and homeopathy. While the scientific
community has raised concerns about the efficacy of these approaches, proponents argue that they
can enhance the performance of BCIs by promoting relaxation and reducing mental fatigue. For
instance, a study found that subjects who underwent acupuncture treatment prior to BCI use exhibited
improved signal quality and reduced error rates. Although these findings are intriguing, they require
further investigation to fully understand their implications.
The use of brain-computer interfaces has also raised important questions about the ethics of neural
enhancement and the potential risks associated with invasive neural recordings. Some experts have
warned about the potential for BCIs to be used as a means of mind control, highlighting the need
for stringent regulations and guidelines to ensure the safe and responsible development of these
technologies. Meanwhile, others have speculated about the possibility of using BCIs to enhance
human cognition, potentially leading to a new era of human evolution. As research in this field
continues to advance, it is essential to consider the broader societal implications of these technologies
and ensure that they are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner.
2
Moreover, the integration of BCIs with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and
the Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to revolutionize the field of assistive devices. The potential
for BCIs to control smart homes, autonomous vehicles, and other IoT devices could significantly
improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. However, this also raises concerns about
data privacy, security, and the potential for biases in AI algorithms to perpetuate existing social
inequalities. To address these challenges, researchers must prioritize the development of transparent,
explainable, and fair AI systems that can be seamlessly integrated with BCIs.
Overall, the field of brain-computer interfaces is rapidly evolving, with significant advancements
being made in various areas, including signal processing, machine learning, and user interface design.
As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with BCIs, it is essential to
consider the potential risks and benefits of these technologies and ensure that they are developed and
used in a responsible and ethical manner. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of BCIs to
improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and enhance human cognition, while also promoting
a safer and more equitable society.

Methodology
The development of next-generation brain-computer interfaces for assistive devices necessitates a mul-
tidisciplinary approach, integrating concepts from neuroscience, computer science, and engineering.
To create an efficient and user-friendly interface, we employed a combination of electroencephalog-
raphy and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record brain activity. The signals were then
processed using a novel algorithm that incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis,
allowing for the identification of complex patterns in brain activity.
An unexpected yet intriguing approach was the incorporation of a specially designed fragrance
emission system, which releases specific scents in response to brain activity. This olfactory feedback
mechanism was found to enhance user engagement and focus, leading to improved accuracy in
device control. The scents used were carefully selected based on their purported effects on cognitive
function, including peppermint for attention and lavender for relaxation.
The brain-computer interface was then integrated with a variety of assistive devices, including
robotic arms, wheelchairs, and communication systems. Users were able to control these devices
with remarkable precision, achieving a high level of autonomy and independence. However, it
was observed that the interface was also susceptible to interference from external factors, such as
changes in weather patterns and the phases of the moon. This led to the development of a lunar cycle
compensation algorithm, which adjusts the interface’s sensitivity and response time based on the
current lunar phase.
In a bizarre yet fascinating tangent, it was discovered that the brain-computer interface was also
capable of detecting and responding to the user’s subconscious thoughts and desires. This was
achieved through the use of a specially designed subconscious resonance chamber, which amplifies
and decodes the user’s unconscious brain activity. The implications of this discovery are profound,
and could potentially lead to the development of new technologies that can read and respond to
human thoughts and emotions.
The methodology used in this study was rigorous and systematic, involving a comprehensive analysis
of user data and device performance. However, it was also marked by a series of illogical and
seemingly flawed results, which were nonetheless presented as legitimate findings. For example,
it was found that the brain-computer interface was more accurate when used in conjunction with a
specific brand of coffee, and that the device’s performance was enhanced by the presence of a small,
furry animal in the room. These results were attributed to the complex and dynamic nature of the
human brain, and the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms and principles of
brain-computer interaction.

Experiments
To evaluate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach in preserving ancient musical instruments,
we conducted a series of experiments involving a range of instruments from different historical
periods. Our experimental design consisted of two primary components: a control group, where
3
traditional preservation methods were employed, and a treatment group, where our data-driven
approach was applied. The treatment group was further divided into two sub-groups: one where the
instruments were preserved using a machine learning-based technique, and another where a more
unorthodox approach was used, involving the use of sound waves generated by a didgeridoo to ""heal""
the instruments.
The machine learning-based technique involved training a neural network on a dataset of images and
audio recordings of the instruments, with the goal of predicting the optimal preservation strategy for
each instrument. This approach showed promising results, with a significant reduction in deterioration
observed in the treated instruments compared to the control group. However, the didgeridoo-based
approach yielded surprising results, with some instruments showing an unexpected increase in
deterioration, while others appeared to be unaffected. We speculate that the sound waves generated
by the didgeridoo may have had an unpredictable effect on the instrument’s materials, potentially
disrupting the preservation process.
In addition to these experiments, we also conducted a series of simulations to model the effects of
different environmental factors on the preservation of ancient musical instruments. These simulations
involved creating virtual models of the instruments and subjecting them to various environmental
stresses, such as changes in temperature and humidity. The results of these simulations provided
valuable insights into the potential risks and challenges associated with preserving ancient musical
instruments, and highlighted the need for a more nuanced and data-driven approach to preservation.
To further illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach, we present the results of our
experiments in the following table: These results demonstrate the potential benefits of using a

research into the application of machine learning and other technologies in this field. Furthermore,
the unusual results obtained from the didgeridoo-based approach suggest that there may be alternative,
unconventional methods for preserving ancient musical instruments that warrant further investigation.

Results
The application of data-driven approaches to the preservation of ancient musical instruments has
yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, challenging conventional wisdom and sparking debate
within the community. A comprehensive analysis of the acoustic properties of ancient instruments,
facilitated by cutting-edge signal processing techniques, has enabled researchers to pinpoint subtle
patterns and anomalies that were previously unknown. For instance, a peculiar correlation was
discovered between the resonant frequencies of ancient lyres and the celestial movements of celestial
bodies, prompting some investigators to propose a radical new theory: that the instruments were, in
fact, designed to harmonize with the cosmos.
This hypothesis, though unorthodox, has sparked a flurry of interest and experimentation, with some
researchers attempting to recreate the supposed ""cosmic harmonics"" using modern instrumentation
and machine learning algorithms. While the results of these experiments are still inconclusive, they
have nevertheless led to the development of novel preservation techniques, such as the use of artificial
intelligence-powered resonators to enhance the sonic properties of fragile or damaged instruments.
Moreover, the incorporation of data-driven methods has facilitated the creation of detailed, high-
fidelity digital models of ancient instruments, allowing for unprecedented levels of analysis and
simulation.

One of the most significant breakthroughs in this field has been the discovery of a previously unknown
type of ancient instrument, hidden away in a long-forgotten archive of archaeological artifacts.
Through a combination of computational modeling and experimental reconstruction, researchers
have been able to recreate the instrument, which has been dubbed the ""Aurora Pipe."" Preliminary
findings suggest that the Aurora Pipe possesses unique acoustic properties, capable of generating an
extraordinary range of tonal frequencies and harmonics. Further study of this enigmatic instrument is
expected to shed new light on the evolution of ancient music and the cultural context in which it was
created.
To illustrate the efficacy of data-driven preservation techniques, a comparative study was conducted
on a selection of ancient instruments, with results presented in the following table: The data clearly in-

dicates that the data-driven approach, particularly when combined with the Aurora Pipe enhancement,
yields superior results in terms of instrument preservation and restoration. As research in this field
continues to advance, it is likely that even more innovative and effective methods will be developed,
ultimately leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of ancient musical instruments and the
cultures that created them.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the data-driven preservation of ancient musical instruments presents a unique op-
portunity for interdisciplinary research, combining musicology, materials science, and artificial
intelligence. By analyzing large datasets of instrument characteristics, environmental factors, and
restoration techniques, researchers can develop predictive models to forecast the degradation of
instruments over time. However, an unconventional approach to preservation involves utilizing the
sonic properties of the instruments themselves to generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, where
the instrument’s own vibrations are used to repair and maintain its structural integrity. This method,
dubbed ""sonic autorepair,"" proposes that the inherent harmonics and resonant frequencies of the
instrument can be harnessed to stimulate a process of self-healing, effectively reversing the effects
of aging and wear. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it underscores the innovative and often
unorthodox nature of research in this field, where the intersection of art and science can lead to novel
and groundbreaking solutions. Furthermore, the development of data-driven preservation strategies
has significant implications for the conservation of cultural heritage, enabling the protection and
restoration of historic instruments for future generations to appreciate and study. Ultimately, the
pursuit of knowledge in this area has the potential to not only advance our understanding of ancient
musical instruments but also inspire new technologies and approaches to preservation, pushing the
boundaries of what is thought to be possible in the realm of cultural conservation.

P004.pdf,"Graph Neural Networks Without Training: Harnessing the Power of
Labels as Input Features
Abstract
This study introduces a novel concept of training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs) for transductive node
classification, which can function immediately without any training and can optionally be enhanced through
subsequent training. Initially, we put forward the idea of using labels as features (LaF), a valid yet relatively
unexplored method in graph neural networks. Our analysis demonstrates that incorporating labels as features
significantly improves the representational capacity of GNNs. The design of TFGNNs is based on these findings.
Empirical evaluations show that TFGNNs surpass current GNNs in scenarios where training is not performed, and
when training is optionally applied, they achieve convergence much faster than conventional GNNs.
1
Introduction
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence as effective models for handling graph-structured data. They have
demonstrated impressive performance across a range of tasks, including chemical structure analysis, question answering systems,
and recommender systems.
A common application for GNNs is transductive node classification. In this task, the objective is to infer the labels of specific nodes
within a graph, given the labels of other nodes. This approach finds utility in various real-world scenarios, such as classifying
documents, analyzing e-commerce data, and studying social networks. Several GNN architectures, including Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), have successfully addressed transductive node classification, yielding
excellent results.
A significant hurdle in the practical application of GNNs is their computational demand. Real-world graphs, such as those
representing social networks or the structure of the web, can be enormous, containing billions of nodes. Processing these massive
graphs can be computationally prohibitive. While various methods have been developed to enhance the efficiency of GNNs, such as
node and edge sampling techniques, these methods still necessitate numerous training iterations. Other approaches, like PinSAGE,
utilize parallel training and importance pooling to accelerate the training process, but they demand substantial computational
resources. Consequently, the immediate deployment of GNNs with limited resources remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce the concept of training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs). To realize TFGNNs, we first propose the
innovative idea of using labels as features (LaF). In the context of transductive node classification, utilizing node labels as features is
a permissible approach. GNNs employing LaF can leverage label information, like the distribution of classes among neighboring
nodes, to generate node embeddings. These embeddings are richer in information compared to those derived solely from node
features. We establish that incorporating labels as features demonstrably augments the expressive capability of GNNs.
TFGNNs possess the unique ability to operate without any training, enabling immediate deployment upon initialization. This
eliminates the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning when used in training-free mode. Furthermore, TFGNNs can be refined
through optional training. Users have the flexibility to employ TFGNNs without training or to train them for a limited number of
iterations when computational resources are constrained. This adaptability is particularly valuable in online learning scenarios,
where data arrives sequentially, and the model needs to be updated promptly. TFGNNs can also undergo full training when resources
are plentiful or when higher accuracy is paramount. In essence, TFGNNs offer the advantages of both nonparametric models and
traditional GNNs.
Our experiments confirm that TFGNNs surpass existing GNNs when used without training and achieve convergence significantly
faster than traditional GNNs when training is applied.
The primary contributions of this research are outlined below:
* We propose the utilization of labels as features (LaF) in transductive learning settings. * We provide formal proof that LaF enhances
the representational power of GNNs. * We introduce a novel architecture for training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs). * We
empirically demonstrate that TFGNNs outperform existing GNNs in the absence of training.

Background
2.1
Notations
For any positive integer n, [n] represents the set {1, 2, ..., n}. A graph is represented by a tuple comprising (i) a set of nodes V , (ii) a
set of edges E, and (iii) node features X = [x1, x2, ..., xn]T ∈Rn×d. We assume nodes are numbered from 1 to n. Y denotes the
set of possible labels. yv ∈R|Y | is the one-hot encoded label for node v. N(v) represents the set of neighboring nodes of node
v. We use numpy-like indexing notation. For instance, X:,1 denotes the first column of X, X:,−1 denotes the last column, X:,−5:
denotes the last five columns, and X:,:−5 denotes all columns except the last five.
2.2
Transductive Node Classification
**Problem (Transductive Node Classification).** **Input:** A graph G = (V, E, X), a set of labeled nodes Vtrain ⊂V , and
the corresponding labels Ytrain ∈Y Vtrain for these nodes. **Output:** Predicted labels Ytest ∈Y Vtest for the remaining nodes
Vtest = V \\ Vtrain.
The node classification problem has two distinct settings: transductive and inductive. In the transductive setting, a single graph
is provided along with the labels for a subset of its nodes, and the task is to predict the labels for the unlabeled nodes within the
same graph. This contrasts with the inductive setting, where separate graphs are used for training and testing. For example, in the
context of spam detection, if we label spam accounts on a social network like Facebook and then use a trained model to identify
spam accounts on the same network, this is a transductive scenario. Conversely, if we use the model trained on Facebook data to
identify spam accounts on a different platform like Twitter, this is an inductive scenario.
Transductive node classification is a widely studied problem in the GNN community. It has been employed in well-known GNN
models like GCNs and GATs and is used in popular benchmark datasets such as Cora, PubMed, and CiteSeer. This setting also has
numerous practical applications, including document classification and fraud detection.
2.3
Graph Neural Networks
GNNs are a prevalent method for solving transductive node classification problems. We adopt the message-passing framework for
GNNs. A message-passing GNN can be defined as follows:
h(0)
v
= xv (∀v ∈V ),
h(l)
v
= f (l)
agg(h(l−1)
v
, {h(l−1)
u
|u ∈N(v)}) (∀l ∈[L], v ∈V ),
ˆyv = fpred(h(L)
v
) (∀v ∈V ),
where f (l)
agg is the aggregation function at layer l, and fpred is the prediction head, typically implemented using neural networks.
3
LaF is Admissible, but Not Explored Well
We remind the reader of the transductive node classification problem setup. We are given the node labels yv of the training nodes. A
standard approach is to input the node features xv of a training node v into the model, predict its label, calculate the loss based on
the true label yv, and update the model parameters. However, the use of yv is not restricted to this. We can also incorporate yv as a
feature for node v. This is the core concept behind LaF.
GNNs with LaF initialize node embeddings as:
h(0)
v
= [xv; ˜yv] ∈Rd+1+|Y |,
where [·; ·] denotes vector concatenation, and
˜yv = { [ 1; yv](v ∈Vtrain)
01+|Y |(v ∈Vtest),
is the label vector for node v, and 0d is a zero vector of dimension d. LaF allows GNNs to utilize label information, such as the class
distribution in neighboring nodes, to compute node embeddings. These embeddings are likely to be more informative than those
without label information. LaF is considered admissible because it only uses information available in the transductive setting.
We emphasize that LaF has not been thoroughly investigated in the GNN literature, despite its simplicity, with a few exceptions.
For instance, GCNs and GATs use the transductive setting and could potentially use label information as features. However, they
initialize node embeddings as h(0)
v
= xv without using label information. One of the contributions of this paper is to highlight that
LaF is permissible in the transductive setting.
2
Care must be taken when training GNNs with LaF. LaF might negatively impact generalization by creating a shortcut where the
model simply copies the label feature h(0)
v,d+1: to the prediction. To avoid this, we should remove the labels of the center nodes in the
minibatch and treat them as test nodes. Specifically, if B ⊂Vtrain is the set of nodes in the minibatch, we set
˜yv = { [ 1; yv](v ∈Vtrain \\ B)
01+|Y |(v ∈Vtest ∪B),
and predict the label ˆyv for v ∈B, calculating the loss based on ˆyv and yv. This simulates the transductive setting where the label
information of test nodes is unavailable, and GNNs learn to predict test node labels based on the label information and node features
of surrounding nodes.
4
LaF Strengthens the Expressive Power of GNNs
We demonstrate that incorporating labels as features (LaF) provably enhances the expressive capabilities of Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs). Specifically, we show that GNNs utilizing LaF can effectively represent the label propagation algorithm, a crucial method
for transductive node classification, whereas GNNs without LaF cannot achieve this. This finding is significant in its own right and
provides a strong motivation for the design of TFGNNs.
Label propagation is a well-established method for transductive node classification. It operates by initiating random walks from a
test node and generating the label distribution of the labeled nodes that these random walks encounter first. The following theorem
establishes that GNNs with LaF can effectively approximate label propagation.
**Theorem 4.1.** GNNs with LaF can approximate label propagation with arbitrary precision. Specifically, there exists a series of
GNNs {f (l)
agg}l and fpred such that for any positive ϵ, for any connected graph G = (V, E, X), for any labeled nodes Vtrain ⊂V and
node labels Ytrain ∈Y Vtrain, and test node v ∈V \\ Vtrain, there exists L ∈Z+ such that the l(≥L)-th GNN (f (1)
agg, ..., f (l)
agg, fpred)
with LaF outputs an approximation of label propagation with an error of at most ϵ, i.e.,
||ˆyv −ˆyLP
v
||1 < ϵ,
where ˆyLP
v
is the output of label propagation for test node v.
**Proof.** We prove the theorem by construction. Let
pl,v,idef= Pr[The random walk from node v hits Vtrain within l steps and the first hit label is i].
For labeled nodes, this is a constant:
pl,v,i = 1[i=yv] (∀l ∈Z≥0, v ∈Vtrain, i ∈Y ).
For other nodes, it can be recursively computed as:
p0,v,i = 0 (∀v ∈V \\ Vtrain, i ∈Y ),
pl,v,i = P
u∈N(v)
1
deg(v) · pl−1,u,i.
These equations can be represented by GNNs with LaF. The base case
p0,v,i = { 1 [i=yv] (v ∈Vtrain)
0(v ∈V \\ Vtrain),
can be computed from ˜yv in h(0)
v . Let f (l)
agg always concatenate its first argument (h(l−1)
v
) to the output so the GNN retains input
information. f (l)
agg handles two cases based on ˜yv,1 ∈{0, 1}, indicating whether v is in Vtrain. If v ∈Vtrain, f (l)
agg outputs 1[i=yv],
computable from ˜yv in h(l−1)
v
. If v /∈Vtrain, f (l)
agg aggregates pl−1,u,i from u ∈N(v) and averages them, as in the recursive
equation, realizable by message passing in the second argument of f (l)
agg.
The final output of the GNN is pl,v,i. The output of label propagation can be decomposed as:
ˆyLP
v,i = Pr[The first hit label is i]
= pl,v,i+ Pr[The random walk from node v does not hit Vtrain within l steps and the first hit label is i].
As the second term converges to zero as l increases, GNNs can approximate label propagation with arbitrary precision by increasing
l.
We then show that GNNs without LaF cannot represent label propagation.
**Proposition 4.2.** GNNs without LaF cannot approximate label propagation. Specifically, for any series of GNNs {f (l)
agg}l and
fpred, there exists a positive ϵ, a connected graph G = (V, E, X), labeled nodes Vtrain ⊂V , node labels Ytrain ∈Y Vtrain, and a
test node v ∈V \\ Vtrain, such that for any l, the GNN (f (1)
agg, ..., f (l)
agg, fpred) without LaF has an error of at least ϵ, i.e.,
3
||ˆyv −ˆyLP
v
||1 > ϵ,
where ˆyLP
v
is the output of label propagation for test node v.
**Proof.** We construct a counterexample. Let G be a cycle of four nodes numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 clockwise. All nodes have the same
feature x. Let Vtrain = {1, 2} and Ytrain = [1, 0]T . Label propagation classifies node 4 as class 1 and node 3 as class 0. However,
GNNs without LaF always predict the same label for nodes 3 and 4 since they are isomorphic. Thus, for any GNN without LaF,
there is an irreducible error for either node 3 or 4.
Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2 demonstrate that LaF provably enhances the expressive power of GNNs. These results indicate that
GNNs with LaF are more powerful than traditional message-passing GNNs like GCNs, GATs, and GINs without LaF. Notably, while
GINs are considered the most expressive message-passing GNNs, they cannot represent label propagation without LaF, whereas
message-passing GNNs with LaF can. This does not lead to a contradiction since the original GINs do not take the label information
as input. In other words, the input domains of the functions differ. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the
input and the architecture of GNNs to maximize their expressive power.

Training-free Graph Neural Networks
We propose training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs) based on the analysis in the previous section. TFGNNs can be used
without training and can also be improved with optional training.
First, we define training-free models.
**Definition 5.1 (Training-free Model).** We say a parametric model is training-free if it can be used without optimizing the
parameters.
It should be noted that nonparametric models are training-free by definition. The real worth of TFGNNs is that it is training-free
while it can be improved with optional training. Users can enjoy the best of both worlds of parametric and nonparametric models by
choosing the trade-off based on the computational resources for training and the accuracy required.
The core idea of TFGNNs is to embed label propagation in GNNs by Theorem 4.1. TFGNNs are defined as follows:
h(0)
v
= [xv; ˜yv],
h(l)
v
= { ReLU(S(l)h(l−1)
v
+
1
|N(v)|
P
u∈N(v) W (l)h(l−1)
u
)(v ∈Vtrain, l ∈[L])
ReLU(T (l)h(l−1)
v
+
1
|N(v)|
P
u∈N(v) W (l)h(l−1)
u
)(v ∈Vtest, l ∈[L]),
ˆyv = softmax(Uh(L)
v
),
The architecture of TFGNNs is standard, i.e., TFGNNs transform the center nodes and carry out mean aggregation from the
neighboring nodes. The key to TFGNNs lies in initialization. The parameters are initialized as follows:
S(l)
−(1+|Y |):,:−(1+|Y |) = 0, S(l)
−(1+|Y |):,−(1+|Y |): = I1+|Y |, V (l)
−(1+|Y |): = 0, T (l)
−(1+|Y |): = 0, W (l)
−(1+|Y |):,:−(1+|Y |) = 0,
W (l)
−(1+|Y |):,−(1+|Y |): = I1+|Y |, U:,:−|Y | = 0, U:,−|Y |: = I|Y |,
i.e., the parameters of the last (1 + |Y |) rows or |Y | rows are initialized by 0 or 1 in a special pattern (Figure 1). Other parameters
are initialized randomly, e.g., by Xavier initialization. The following proposition shows that the initialized TFGNNs approximate
label propagation.
**Proposition 5.2.** The initialized TFGNNs approximate label propagation. Specifically,
h(L)
v,−(|Y |−i+1) = pL,v,i
holds, where pL,v,i is defined in Eq. (8), and
argmaxiˆyv,i = argmaxipL,v,i
holds, and pL,v,i →ˆyLP
v,i as L →∞.
**Proof.** By the definitions of TFGNNs,
h(0)
v,−|Y |: = { y v (v ∈Vtrain)
0|Y |(v ∈Vtest),
h(l)
v,−|Y |: = { h
(l−1)
v,−|Y |: (v ∈Vtrain, l ∈[L])
1
|N(v)|
P
u∈N(v) h(l−1)
u,−|Y |:(v ∈Vtest, l ∈[L]).
This recursion is the same as Eqs. (9) – (13). Therefore,
4
h(L)
v,−(|Y |−i+1) = pL,v,i
holds. As U picks the last |Y | dimensions, and softmax is monotone,
argmaxiˆyv,i = argmaxipL,v,i
holds. pL,v,i →ˆyLP
v,i as L →∞is shown in the proof of Theorem 4.1.
Therefore, the initialized TFGNNs can be used for transductive node classification as are without training. The approximation
algorithm of label propagation is seamlessly embedded in the model parameters, and TFGNNs can also be trained as usual GNNs.

Experiments
6.1
Experimental Setup
We use the Planetoid datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed), Coauthor datasets, and Amazon datasets in the experiments. We use 20
nodes per class for training, 500 nodes for validation, and the rest for testing in the Planetoid datasets following standard practice,
and use 20 nodes per class for training, 30 nodes per class for validation, and the rest for testing in the Coauthor and Amazon
datasets. We use GCNs and GATs for the baselines. We use three-layered models with a hidden dimension of 32 unless otherwise
specified. We train all models with AdamW with a learning rate of 0.0001 and weight decay of 0.01.
6.2
TFGNNs Outperform Existing GNNs in Training-free Setting
We compare the performance of TFGNNs with GCNs and GATs in the training-free setting by assessing the accuracy of the models
when the parameters are initialized. The results are shown in Table 1. TFGNNs outperform GCNs and GATs in all the datasets.
Specifically, both GCNs and GATs are almost random in the training-free setting, while TFGNNs achieve non-trivial accuracy. These
results validate that TFGNNs meet the definition of training-free models. We can also observe that GCNs, GATs, and TFGNNs do
not benefit from LaF in the training-free settings if randomly initialized. These results indicate that both LaF and the initialization of
TFGNNs are important for training-free performance.

These results indicate that TFGNNs are training-free. Note that we use three-layered TFGNNs to make the comparison fair although
deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting as we confirm in Section 6.3.

Deep TFGNNs Perform Better in Training-free Setting
We confirm that deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting. We have used three-layered TFGNNs so far to make
the comparison fair with existing GNNs. Proposition 5.2 shows that the initialized TFGNNs converge to label propagation as the
depth goes to infinity, and we expect that deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting. Figure 2 shows the accuracy of
TFGNNs with different depths for the Cora dataset. We can observe that deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting
until the depth reaches around 10, where the performance saturates. It is noteworthy that GNNs have been known to suffer from the
oversmoothing problem, and the performance of GNNs degrades as the depth increases. It is interesting that TFGNNs do not suffer
from the oversmoothing problem in the training-free setting. It should be noted that it does not necessarily mean that deeper models
perform better in the optional training mode because the optional training may break the structure introduced by the initialization of
TFGNNs and may lead to oversmoothing and/or overfitting. We leave it as a future work to overcome these problems by adopting
countermeasures such as initial residual and identity mapping, MADReg, and DropEdge.
6.4
TFGNNs Converge Fast
In the following, we investigate the optional training mode of TFGNNs. We train the models with three random seeds and report the
average accuracy and standard deviation. We use baseline GCNs without LaF (i.e., the original GCNs) as the baseline.
First, we confirm that TFGNNs in the optional training mode converge faster than GCNs. We show the training curves of TFGNNs
and GCNs for the Cora dataset in Figure 3. TFGNNs converge much faster than GCNs. We hypothesize that TFGNNs converge
5
faster because the initialized TFGNNs are in a good starting point, while GCNs start from a completely random point and require
many iterations to reach a good point. We can also observe that fully trained TFGNNs perform on par with GCNs. These results
indicate that TFGNNs enjoy the best of both worlds: TFGNNs perform well without training and can be trained faster with optional
training.
6.5
TFGNNs are Robust to Feature Noise
As TFGNNs use both node features and label information while traditional GNNs rely only on node features, we expect that
TFGNNs are more robust to feature noise than traditional GNNs. We confirm this in this section. We add i.i.d. Gaussian noise with
standard deviation σ to the node features and evaluate the accuracy of the models. We train TFGNNs and GCNs with the Cora
dataset. The results are shown in Figure 4. TFGNNs are more robust to feature noise especially in high noise regimes where the
performance of GCNs degrades significantly. These results indicate that TFGNNs are more robust to i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the
node features than traditional GNNs.

Related Work
7.1
Labels as Features and Training-free GNNs
The most relevant work is by Wang et al., who proposed to use node labels in GNNs. This technique was also used by Addanki et al.
and analyzed by Wang et al. The underlying idea is common with LaF, i.e., use of label information as input to transductive GNNs.
A similar result as Theorem 4.1 was also shown in Wang et al. However, the focus is different, and there are different points between
this work and theirs. We propose the training-free + optional training framework for the first time. The notable characteristics of
GNNs are (i) TFGNNs receive both original features and LaF, (ii) TFGNNs can be deployed without training, and (iii) TFGNNs can
be improved with optional training. Besides, we provide detailed analysis and experiments including the speed of convergence and
noise robustness. Our results provide complementary insights to the existing works.
Another related topic is graph echo state networks, which lead to lightweight models for graph data. The key idea is to use randomly
initialized fixed weights for aggregation. The main difference is that graph echo state networks still require to train the output layer,
while TFGNNs can be used without training. These methods are orthogonal, and it is an interesting direction to combine them to
further improve the performance.
7.2
Speeding up GNNs
Various methods have been proposed to speed up GNNs to handle large graph data. GraphSAGE is one of the earliest methods to
speed up GNNs. GraphSAGE employs neighbor sampling to reduce the computational cost of training and inference. It samples a
fixed number of neighbors for each node and aggregates the features of the sampled neighbors. An alternative sampling method is
layer-wise sampling introduced in FastGCN. Huang et al. further improved FastGCN by using an adaptive node sampling technique
to reduce the variance of estimators. LADIES combined neighbor sampling and layer-wise sampling to take the best of both worlds.
Another approach is to use smaller training graphs. ClusterGCN uses a cluster of nodes as a mini-batch. GraphSAINT samples
subgraphs by random walks for each mini-batch.
It should also be noted that general techniques to speed up neural networks, such as mixed-precision training, quantization, and
pruning can be applied to GNNs.
These methods mitigate the training cost of GNNs, but they still require many training iterations. In this paper, we propose
training-free GNNs, which can be deployed instantly as soon as the model is initialized. Besides, our method can be improved with
optional training. In the optional training mode, the speed up techniques mentioned above can be combined with our method to
reduce the training time further.

Expressive Power of GNNs
Expressive power (or representation power) means what kind of functional classes a model family can realize. The expressive power
of GNNs is an important field of research in its own right. If GNNs cannot represent the true function, we cannot expect GNNs to
work well however we train them. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the expressive power of GNNs. Originally, Morris et al. and
Xu et al. showed that message-passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the 1-WL test, and they proposed k-GNNs and GINs, which
are as powerful as the k-(set)WL and 1-WL tests, respectively. GINs are the most powerful message-passing GNNs. Sato and Loukas
showed that message-passing GNNs are as powerful as a computational model of distributed local algorithms, and they proposed
GNNs that are as powerful as port-numbering and randomized local algorithms. Loukas showed that GNNs are Turing-complete
under certain conditions (i.e., with unique node ids and infinitely increasing depths). Some other works showed that GNNs can
solve or cannot solve some specific problems, e.g., GNNs can recover the underlying geometry, GNNs cannot recognize bridges and
articulation points. There are various efforts to improve the expressive power of GNNs by non-message-passing architectures. We
refer the readers to survey papers for more details on the expressive power of GNNs.
6
We contributed to the field of the expressive power of GNNs by showing that GNNs with LaF are more powerful than GNNs without
LaF. Specifically, we showed that GNNs with LaF can represent an important model, label propagation, while GNNs without LaF
cannot. It should be emphasized that GINs, the most powerful message-passing GNNs, and Turing-complete GNNs cannot represent
label propagation without LaF because they do not have access to the label information label propagation uses, and also noted that
GINs traditionally do not use LaF. This result indicates that it is important to consider what to input to the GNNs as well as the
architecture of the GNNs for the expressive power of GNNs. This result provides a new insight into the field of the expressive power
of GNNs.
8
Limitations
Our work has several limitations. First, LaF and TFGNNs cannot be applied to inductive settings while most GNNs can. We do not
regard this as a negative point. Popular GNNs such as GCNs and GATs are applicable to both transductive and inductive settings and
are often used for transductive settings. However, this also means that they do not take advantage of transductive-specific structures
(those that are not present in inductive settings). We believe that it is important to exploit inductive-specific techniques for inductive
settings and transductive-specific techniques (such as LaF) for transductive settings in order to pursue maximum performance.
Second, TFGNNs cannot be applied to heterophilious graphs, or its performance degrades as TFGNNs are based on label propagation.
The same argument mentioned above applies. Relying on homophilious graphs is not a negative point in pursuing maximum
performance. It should be noted that LaF may also be exploited in heterophilious settings as well. Developing training-free GNNs
for heterophilious graphs based on LaF is an interesting future work.
Third, we did not aim to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Exploring the combination of LaF with fancy techniques to
achieve state-of-the-art performance is left as future work.
Finally, we did not explore applications of LaF other than TFGNNs. LaF can help other GNNs in non-training-free settings as well.
Exploring the application of LaF to other GNNs is left as future work.

Conclusion
In this paper, we made the following contributions.
* We advocated the use of LaF in transductive learning (Section 3). * We confirmed that LaF is admissible in transductive learning,
but LaF has not been explored in the field of GNNs such as GCNs and GATs. * We formally showed that LaF strengthens the
expressive power of GNNs (Section 4). * We showed that GNNs with LaF can represent label propagation (Theorem 4.1) while

P060.pdf,"Background Modeling Using Adaptive Pixelwise
Kernel Variances in a Hybrid Feature Space
Abstract
Recent work on background subtraction has shown developments on two major
fronts. In one, there has been increasing sophistication of probabilistic models,
from mixtures of Gaussians at each pixel, to kernel density estimates at each
pixel, and more recently to joint domain-range density estimates that incorporate
spatial information. Another line of work has shown the benefits of increasingly
complex feature representations, including the use of texture information, local
binary patterns, and recently scale-invariant local ternary patterns. In this work, we
use joint domain-range based estimates for background and foreground scores and
show that dynamically choosing kernel variances in our kernel estimates at each
individual pixel can significantly improve results. We give a heuristic method for
selectively applying the adaptive kernel calculations which is nearly as accurate as
the full procedure but runs much faster. We combine these modeling improvements
with recently developed complex features and show significant improvements on a
standard backgrounding benchmark.
1
Introduction
Background modeling is often an important step in detecting moving objects in video sequences. A
common approach to background modeling is to define and learn a background distribution over
feature values at each pixel location and then classify each image pixel as belonging to the background
process or not. The distributions at each pixel may be modeled in a parametric manner using a mixture
of Gaussians or using non-parametric kernel density estimation. More recently, models that allow
a pixel’s spatial neighbors to influence its distribution have been developed by joint domain-range
density estimation. These models that allow spatial influence from neighboring pixels have been
shown to perform better than earlier neighbor-independent models.
Also, the use of an explicit foreground model along with a background model can be useful. In a
manner similar to theirs, we use a kernel estimate to obtain the background and foreground scores
at each pixel location using data samples from a spatial neighborhood around that location from
previous frames. The background score is computed as a kernel estimate depending on the distance
in the joint domain-range space between the estimation point and the samples in the background
model. A similar estimate is obtained for the foreground score. Each pixel is then assigned a (soft)
label based on the ratio of the background and foreground scores.
The variance used in the estimation kernel reflects the spatial and appearance uncertainties in the
scene. On applying our method to a data set with wide variations across the videos, we found that
choosing suitable kernel variances during the estimation process is very important. With various
experiments, we establish that the best kernel variance could vary for different videos and more
importantly, even within a single video, different regions in the image should be treated with different
variance values. For example, in a scene with a steady tree trunk and leaves that are waving in the
wind, the trunk region can be explained with a small amount of spatial variance. The leaf regions
may be better explained by a process with a large variance. Interestingly, when there is no wind, the
leaf regions may also be explained with a low variance. The optimal variance hence changes for
.
each region in the video and also across time. This phenomenon is captured reasonably in MoG by
use of different parameters for each pixel which adapt dynamically to the scene statistics, but the
pixel-wise model does not allow a pixel’s neighbors to affect its distribution. address the phenomenon
by updating the model with data samples from the most recent frame. We show that using location-
specific variances in addition to updating the model greatly improves background modeling. Our
approach with pixel-wise variances, which we call the variable kernel score (VKS) method results in
significant improvement over uniform variance models and state of the art backgrounding systems.
The idea of using a pixel-wise variance for background modeling is not new. Although use a uniform
variance, they discuss the use of variances that change as a function of the data samples or as a
function of the point at which the estimation is made. Variance selection for KDE is a well studied
problem with common solutions including mean integrated square error (MISE), asymptotic MISE
(AMISE), and the leave-one-out-estimator based solutions. In the background subtraction context,
there has been work on using a different covariance at each pixel. While require that the uncertainties
in the feature values can be calculated in closed form, learn the covariances for each pixel from a
training set of frames and keep the learned covariances fixed for the entire classification phase. We
use a maximum-likelihood approach to select the best variance at each pixel location. For every
frame of the video, at each pixel location, the best variance is picked from a set of variance values
by maximizing the likelihood of the pixel’s observation under different variances. This makes our
method a balloon estimator. By explicitly selecting the best variance from a range of variance values,
we do not require the covariances to be calculable in closed-form and also allow for more flexibility
at the classification stage.
Selecting the best of many kernel variances for each pixel means increased computation. One possible
trade-off between accuracy and speed can be achieved by a caching scheme where the best kernel
variances from the previous frame are used to calculate the scores for the current frame pixels. If the
resulting classification is overwhelmingly in favor of either label, there is no need to perform a search
for the best kernel variance for that pixel. The expensive variance selection procedure can be applied
only to pixels where there is some contention between the two labels. We present a heuristic that
achieves significant reduction in computation compared to our full implementation while maintaining
the benefits of adaptive variance.
Development and improvement of the probabilistic models is one of the two main themes in back-
ground modeling research in recent years. The other theme is the development of complex features
like local binary and ternary patterns that are more robust than color features for the task of back-
ground modeling. Scale-invariant local ternary patterns (SILTP) are recently developed features that
have been shown to be very robust to lighting changes and shadows in the scene. By combining color
features with SILTP features in our adaptive variance kernel model, we bring together the best ideas
from both themes in the field and achieve state of the art results on a benchmark data set.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A practical scheme for pixel-wise variance selection for background modeling.
2. A heuristic for selectively updating variances to improve speed further.
3. Incorporation of complex SILTP features into the joint domain-range kernel framework to
achieve state of the art results.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our background and foreground models.
Dynamic adaptation of kernel variances is discussed in Section 3. Results and comparisons are in
Section 4. An efficient algorithm is discussed in Section 5. We end with a discussion in Section 6.

Background and foreground models
In a video captured by a static camera, the pixel values are influenced by the background phenomenon,
and new or existing foreground objects. We refer to any phenomenon that can affect image pixel
values as a process. Like , we model the background and foreground processes using data samples
from previous frames. The scores for the background and foreground processes at each pixel location
are calculated using contributions from the data samples in each model. One major difference between
and our model is that we allow “soft labeling”, i.e. the data samples contribute probabilistically to the
background score depending on the samples’ probability of belonging to the background.
2
Let a pixel sample a = [ax, ay, ar, ag, ab], where (ax, ay) are the location of the pixel and (ar, ag, ab)
are the red, green, and blue values of the pixel. In each frame of the video, we compute background
and foreground scores using pixel samples from the previous frames. The background model consists
of the samples B = bi : i [1 : nB] and foreground samples are F = fi : i [1 : nF ], with nB and nF being
the number of background and foreground samples respectively, and bi and fi being pixel samples
obtained from previous frames in the video. Under a KDE model, the likelihood of the sample under
the background model is
P(a|bg; σ) = 1
nB
nB
X
i=1
G(a −bi; σB)

where G(x; ) is a multivariate Gaussian with zero mean and covariance B.
G(x; σ) = (2π)−D
2 |σ|−1
2 exp(−1
2xT σ−1x),
(2)
where D is the dimensionality of the vector x.
In our model, we approximate the background score at sample a as
SB(a; σd
B, σrgb
B ) =
1
NB
NB
X
i=1
G(argb −birgb; σrgb
B ) × G(axy −bixy; σd
B) × P(bg|bi)
(3)
NB is the number of frames from which the background samples have been collected, B d and B
rgb are two and three dimensional background covariance matrices in spatial and color dimensions
respectively. A large spatial covariance allows neighboring pixels to contribute more to the score at a
given pixel location. Color covariance allows for some color appearance changes at a given pixel
location. Use of NB in the denominator compensates for the different lengths of the background and
foreground models.
The above equation basically sums the contribution from each background sample based on its
distance in color space, weighted by its distance in spatial dimensions and the probability of the
sample belonging to the background.
The use of P (bg|bi) in Equation 3 and normalization by the number of frames as opposed to the
number of samples means that the score does not sum to 1 over all possible values of a. Thus, the
score, although similar to the likelihood in Equation 1, is not a probability distribution.
A similar equation holds for the foreground score:
SF (a; σd
F , σrgb
F ) =
1
NF
NF
X
i=1
G(argb −firgb; σrgb
F ) × G(axy −fixy; σd
F ) × P(fg|fi)
(4)
NF is the number of frames from which the foreground samples have been collected, F d and F rgb
are the covariances associated with the foreground process.
However, for the foreground process, to account for emergence of new colors in the scene, we mix
in a constant contribution independent of the estimation point’s and data samples’ color values. We
assume that each data sample in a pixel’s spatial neighborhood contributes a constant value u to the
foreground score. The constant contribution UF (a) is given by
UF (a; σd
F ) =
NF
X
i=1
u × G(axy −fixy; σd
F )
(5)
We get a modified foreground score by including the constant contribution:
ˆSF (a; σd
F , σrgb
F ) = αF × UF (a; σd
F ) + (1 −αF ) × SF (a; σd
F , σrgb
F ).
(6)
F is a parameter that represents the amount of mixing between the constant contribution and the color
dependent foreground score. u is set to 106 and is set to 0.5 for our experiments.
To classify a particular sample as background or foreground, we can use a Bayes-like formula:
P(bg|a) =
SB(a; σd
B, σrgb
B )
SB(a; σd
B, σrgb
B ) + ˆSF (a; σd
F , σrgb
F )
(7)
3
P(fg|a) = 1 −P(bg|a).
(8)
Adding the constant factor U to the foreground score (and hence to the denominator of the Bayes-like
equation) has the interesting property that when either one of the foreground or background scores is
significantly larger than U , U has little effect on the classification. However, if both the background
and foreground scores are less than U , then Equation 7 will return a low value as P (bg|a). Hence,
an observation that has very low background and foreground scores will be classified as foreground.
This is desirable because if a pixel observation is not well explained by either model, it is natural to
assume that the pixel is a result of a new object in the scene and is hence foreground. In terms of
likelihoods, adding the constant factor to the foreground likelihood is akin to mixing it with a uniform
distribution.
2.1
Model initialization and update
To initialize the models, it is assumed that the first few frames (typically 50) are all background pixels.
The background model is populated using pixel samples from these frames. In order to improve
efficiency, we sample 5 frames at equal time intervals from these 50 frames. The foreground model is
initialized to have no samples. The modified foreground score (Equation 6) enables colors that are
not well explained by the background model to be classified as foreground, thus bootstrapping the
foreground model. Once the pixel at location (ax, ay) from a new frame is classified using Equation
7, the background and foreground models at the location (ax, ay) can then be updated with the new
sample a. Background and foreground samples at location (ax, ay) from the oldest frame in the
models are replaced by a. Samples from the previous 5 frames are maintained in memory as the
foreground model samples. The label probabilities of the background/foreground from Equation 7
are also saved along with the sample values for subsequent use in the Equations 3 and 4.
One consequence of the update procedure described above is that when a large foreground object
occludes a background pixel at (ax, ay) for more than 50 frames, all the background samples in the
spatial neighborhood of (ax, ay) are replaced by these foreground samples that have very low P (bg|bi)
values. This causes the pixel at (ax, ay) to be misclassified as foreground even when the occluding
foreground object has moved away (because the background score will be extremely low due to the
influence of P (bg|bi) in Equation 3). To avoid this problem, we replace the background sample from
location (ax, ay) in the oldest frame in the background model with the new sample a from the current
frame only if P (bg|a) estimated from Equation 7 is greater than 0.5.
In our chosen evaluation data set, there are several videos with moving objects in the first 50 frames.
The assumption that all these pixels are background is not severely limiting even in these videos.
The model update procedure allows us to recover from any errors that are caused by the presence of
foreground objects in the initialization frames.
2.2
Using MRF to clean the classification
Similar to , we use a Markov random field (MRF) defined over the posterior label probabilities of
the 4-neighbors of each pixel and perform the min-cut procedure to post-process the labels. The
interaction factor between the nodes was set to 1 for all our experiments.
3
Pixel-wise adaptive kernel variance selection
Background and foreground kernels. use the same kernel parameters for background and foreground
models. Given the different nature of the two processes, it is reasonable to use different kernel
parameters. For instance, foreground objects typically move between 5 and 10 pixels per frame in the
data set, whereas background pixels are either stationary or move very little. Hence, it is useful to
have a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the background model.
Optimal kernel variance for all videos. In the results section, we show that for a data set with
large variations like , a single value for kernel variance for all videos is not sufficient to capture the
variability in all the videos.
Variable kernel variance for a single video. As explained in the introduction, different parts of the
scene may have different statistics and hence need different kernel variance values. For example, in
Figure 1a to 1d, having a high spatial dimension kernel variance helps in accurate classification of
4
the water surface pixels, but doing so causes some pixels on the person’s leg to become part of the
background. Ideally, we would have different kernel variances for the water surface pixels and the rest
of the pixels. Similarly in the second video (Figure 1e to 1h), having a high kernel variance allows
accurate classification of some of the fountain pixels as background at the cost of misclassifying
many foreground pixels. The figure also shows that while the medium kernel variance may be the
best choice for the first video, the low kernel variance may be best for the second video.
Optimal kernel variance for classification. Having different variances for the background and
foreground models reflects the differences between the expected uncertainty in the two processes.
However, having different variances for the two processes could cause erroneous classification of
pixels. Figure 2 shows a 1-dimensional example where using a very wide kernel (high variance)
or very narrow kernel for the background process causes misclassification. Assuming that the red
point (square) is a background sample and the blue point (triangle) is a foreground sample, having a
very low variance kernel (dashed red line) or a very high variance (solid red line) for the background
process makes the background likelihood of the center point ‘x’ lower than the foreground likelihood.
Thus, it is important to pick the optimal kernel variance for each process during classification.
In order to address all four issues discussed above, we propose the use of location-specific variances.
For each location in the image, a range of kernel variances is tried and the variance which results in
the highest score is chosen for the background and the foreground models separately.
The background score with location-dependent variances is
SB(a; σBd,x,y, σBrgb,x,y) =
1
NB
NB
X
i=1
G(argb −birgb; σBrgb,x,y) × G(axy −bixy; σBd,x,y) × P(bg|bi)
(9)
where B d,x,y and B rgb,x,y represent the location-specific spatial and color dimension variances at
location (x, y).
For each pixel location (ax, ay), the optimal variance for the background process is selected by
maximizing the score of the background label at sample a under different variance values:
{σ∗
Bd,ax,ay, σ∗
Brgb,ax,ay} = argmaxσBd,ax,ay ,σBrgb,ax,ay SB(a; σBd,ax,ay, σBrgb,ax,ay).
(10)
Here, B RB d and B rgb. RB d and RB rgb,ax,ay d,ax,ay rgb represent the set of spatial and color
dimension variances from which to choose the optimal variance.
A similar procedure may be followed for the foreground score. However, in practice, it was found
that the variance selection procedure yielded large improvements when applied to the background
model and little improvement in the foreground model. Hence, our final implementation uses an
adaptive kernel variance procedure for the background model and a fixed kernel variance for the
foreground model.

Results
For comparisons, we use the data set which consists of 9 videos taken using a static camera in
various environments. The data set offers various challenges including dynamic background like trees
and waves, gradual and sudden illumination changes, and the presence of multiple moving objects.
Ground truth for 20 frames in each video is provided with the data set. The F-measure is used to
measure accuracy.
The effect of choosing various kernel widths for the background and foreground models is shown in
Table 1. The table shows the F-measure for each of the videos in the data set for various choices of
the kernel variances. The first 5 columns correspond to using a constant variance for each process at
all pixel locations in the video. Having identical kernel variances for the background and foreground
models (columns 1, 2) is not as effective as having different variances (all other columns). Comparing
columns 2 and 3 shows that using a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the
background model is beneficial. Changing the spatial variance from 3 (column 3) to 1 (column 4)
helps the overall accuracy in one video (Fountain). Using a selection procedure where the best kernel
variance is chosen from a set of values gives the best results for most videos (column 6) and frames.
Comparison of our selection procedure to a baseline method of using a standard algorithm for variance
selection in KDE (AMISE criterion) shows that the standard algorithm is not as accurate as our
5
method (column 7). Our choice for the variance values for spatial dimension reflects no motion (B d
= 1/4) and very little motion (B d = 3/4) for the background, and moderate amount of motion (F d
= 12/4) for the foreground. For the color dimension, the choice is between little variation (B rgb=
5/4), moderate variation (B rgb= 15/4), and high variation (B rgb= 45/4) for the background, and
moderate variation (F rgb= 15/4) for the foreground. These choices are based on our intuition about
the processes involved. For videos that differ significantly from the videos we use, it is possible that
the baseline AMISE method would perform better.
We would like to point out that ideally the variance value sets should be learned automatically from a
separate training data set. In absence of suitable training data for these videos in particular and for
background subtraction research in general, we resort to manually choosing these values. This also
appears to be the common practice among researchers in this area.
Benchmark comparisons are provided for selected existing methods - MOG, the complex foreground
model (ACMMM03), and SILTP. To evaluate our results, the posterior probability of the background
label is thresholded at a value of 0.5 to get the foreground pixels. Following the same procedure as ,
any foreground 4-connected components smaller than a size threshold of 15 pixels are ignored.
Figure 3 shows qualitative results for the same frames that were reported by . We present results for
our kernel method with uniform variances and adaptive variances with RGB features (Uniform-rgb
and VKS-rgb respectively), and adaptive variances with a hybrid feature space of LAB color and
SILTP features (VKS-lab+siltp). Except for the Lobby video, the VKS results are better than other
methods. The Lobby video is an instance where there is a sudden change in illumination in the
scene (turning a light switch on and off). Due to use of an explicit foreground model, our kernel
methods misclassify most of the pixels as foreground and take a long time to recover from this error.
A possible solution for this case is presented later. Compared to the uniform variance kernel estimates,
we see that VKS-rgb has fewer false positive foreground pixels.
Quantitative results in Table 3 compare the F-measure scores for our method against MoG,
ACMMM03, and SILTP results as reported by . The table shows that methods that share spa-
tial information (uniform kernel and VKS) with RGB features give significantly better results than
methods that use RGB features without spatial sharing. Comparing the variable kernel method to
a uniform kernel method in the same feature space (RGB), we see a significant improvement in
performance for most videos. Scale-invariant local ternary pattern (SILTP) is a recent texture feature
that is robust to soft shadows and lighting changes. We believe SILTP represents the state of the art
in background modeling and hence compare our results to this method. Scale-invariant local states is
a slight variation in the representation of the SILTP feature. For comparison, we use SILTP results
from because in human judgement was used to vary a size threshold parameter for each video. We
believe results from the latter fall under a different category of human-assisted backgrounding and
hence do not compare to our method where no video-specific hand-tuning of parameters was done.
Table 3 shows that SILTP is very robust to lighting changes and works well across the entire data set.
Blue entries in Table 3 correspond to videos where our method performs better than SILTP. VKS
with RGB features (VKS-rgb) performs well in videos that have few shadows and lighting changes.
Use of color features that are more robust to illumination change, like LAB features in place of RGB
helps in successful classification of the shadow regions as background. Texture features are robust
to lighting changes but not effective on large texture-less objects. Color features are effective on
large objects, but not very robust to varying illumination. By combining texture features with LAB
color features, we expect to benefit from the strengths of both feature spaces. Such a combination has
proved useful in earlier work. Augmenting the LAB features with SILTP features (computed at 3
resolutions) in the VKS framework (VKS-lab+siltp) results in an improvement in 7 out of 9 videos
(last column). The variance values used in our implementation are given in Table 2.
We also compare our results (VKS-lab+siltp) to the 5 videos that were submitted as supplementary
material by . Figure 4 highlights some key frames that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of
our system versus the SILTP results. The common problems with our algorithm are shadows being
classified as foreground (row e) and initialization errors (row e shows a scene where the desk was
occluded by people when the background model was initialized. Due to the explicit foreground
model, VKS takes some time to recover from the erroneous initialization). A common drawback with
SILTP is that large texture-less objects have “holes” in them (row a). Use of color features helps
avoid these errors. The SILTP system also loses objects that stop moving (rows b, c, d, f). Due to the
explicit modeling of the foreground, VKS is able to detect objects that stop moving.
6
The two videos in the data set where our algorithm performs worse than SILTP are the Escalator
video (rows g, h) and the Lobby video (rows i, j). In the Escalator video, our algorithm fails at the
escalator steps due to large variation in color in the region.
In the Lobby video, at the time of sudden illumination change, many pixels in the image get classified
as foreground. Due to the foreground model, these pixels continue to be misclassified for a long
duration (row j). The problem is more serious for RGB features (Figure 3 column 2). One method to
address the situation is to observe the illumination change from one frame to the next. If more than
half the pixels in the image change in illumination by a threshold value of TI or more, we throw away
all the background samples at that instance and begin learning a new model from the subsequent 50
frames. This method allows us to address the poor performance in the Lobby video with resulting
F-measure values of 86.77 for uniform-rgb, 78.46 for VKS-rgb, and 77.76 for VKS-lab+siltp. TI of
10 and 2.5 were used for RGB and LAB spaces respectively. The illumination change procedure does
not affect the performance of VKS on any other video in the data set.
5
Caching optimal kernel variances from previous frame
A major drawback with trying multiple variance values at each pixel to select the best variance is
that the amount of computation per pixel increases significantly. In order to reduce the complexity
the algorithm, we use a scheme where the current frame’s optimal variance values for each pixel
location for both the background and foreground processes is stored (Bcache x,y , Fcache x,y ) for
each location (x, y) in the image. When classifying pixels in the next frame, these cached variance
values are first tried. If the resulting scores are very far apart, then it is very likely that the pixel
has not changed its label from the previous frame. The expensive variance selection procedure is
performed only at pixels where the resulting scores are close to each other. Algorithm 1 for efficient
computation results in a reduction in computation in about 80
6
Discussion
By applying kernel estimate method to a large data set, we have established, as do , that the use
of spatial information is extremely helpful. Some of the important issues pertaining to the choice
of kernel parameters for data sets with wide variations have been addressed. Having a uniform
kernel variance for the entire data set and for all pixels in the image results in a poor overall system.
Dynamically adapting the variance for each pixel results in a significant increase in accuracy.
Using color features in the joint domain-range kernel estimation approach can complement complex
background model features in settings where the latter are known to be inaccurate. Combining robust
color features like LAB with texture features like SILTP in a VKS framework yields a highly accurate
background classification system.
For future work, we believe our method could be explained more elegantly in a probabilistic frame-
work where the scores are replaced by likelihoods and informative priors are used in the Bayes rule
classification.

P120.pdf,"A Toolkit for Scrutinizing Neural Network Activations
Abstract
This document introduces diagNNose, an open-source toolkit designed for the
examination of activations within deep neural networks. diagNNose offers a diverse
collection of interpretability methods, enabling a deeper understanding of the
operational dynamics of neural networks. The utility of diagNNose is showcased
through an investigation into subject-verb agreement in language models.
1
Introduction
We present diagNNose, a publicly available library for analyzing the behavior of
deep neural networks. The diagNNose library equips researchers with tools to gain
enhanced understanding of the internal representations formed by these networks,
providing a comprehensive suite of established analysis methods. It accommodates
a variety of model types, with a particular focus on NLP architectures, such as
LSTMs and Transformers.
The availability of open-source libraries has been instrumental in the advancement
and wider adoption of NLP technologies. We enhance the open-source ecosystem
by integrating several interpretability techniques.
Recent years have witnessed significant interest in enhancing our understanding of
the mechanisms by which deep neural networks function. The high-dimensional
architecture of these models makes deciphering their internal dynamics a complex
endeavor. This complexity has spurred the emergence of a specialized subfield
within AI, dedicated to interpretability. diagNNose seeks to consolidate a range of
these interpretability techniques into a unified library.
The primary objective of diagNNose is to facilitate the discovery of linguistic
knowledge encoded within a model’s representations. The library offers abstrac-
tions that enable the investigation of recurrent models in a manner similar to
Transformer models, using a modular design. It includes a module for extracting
model activations. The analysis methods currently implemented in the library
include targeted syntactic evaluation tasks, probing with diagnostic classifiers, and
feature attributions.
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the library and illustrates its
application in a case study centered on subject-verb agreement within language
models. Subsequently, we provide a survey of diagNNose and elaborate on its
specific modules. We conclude with the case study.

Background
The increasing capabilities of language models have resulted in a vibrant area of
research focused on understanding their functionality. Approaches in this field
are frequently interdisciplinary. diagNNose facilitates several influential analysis
methods.
2.1
Targeted Syntactic Evaluations
Language models have been central to numerous achievements in NLP. These
models are trained to predict the probability of upcoming or masked tokens. To
achieve success in this task, models must grasp various linguistic aspects, including
syntax, semantics, and general domain knowledge. One notable area of research
investigating a model’s linguistic competence employs targeted syntactic evalu-
ations. This analysis method contrasts a model’s outputs on minimally different
pairs of grammatical and ungrammatical constructions. If a model assigns a higher
probability to the grammatical construction, it suggests an understanding of the
relevant linguistic principles.
diagNNose supports a diverse set of syntactic tasks and offers an interface for
incorporating new tasks seamlessly.
2.2
Diagnostic Classifiers
Another line of research evaluates a model’s comprehension of linguistic properties
by training diagnostic classifiers on its representations. This technique, also known
as probing, has yielded valuable insights into the internal mechanisms of language
models. The activations used for training these classifiers are not limited to the
hidden states of a language model at its top layer.
There have been recent discussions regarding the extent to which high accuracy in a
diagnostic classifier truly signifies that a property is actively encoded by the model.
Several methods have been put forward to address this, such as using control tasks
or assessing classifiers based on minimum description length. diagNNose currently
supports the training of diagnostic classifiers and control tasks.
2.3
Feature Attributions
While probing helps us identify specific properties embedded in model repre-
sentations, it does not clarify how a model converts input features into accurate
predictions. This can be addressed by calculating the contributions of input fea-
tures to subsequent outputs. This is a complex task due to the high-dimensional,
non-linear nature of deep learning models.
Feature attributions can be calculated in various manners. One common method
involves a concept from cooperative game theory, referred to as the Shapley value.
Computing Shapley values is computationally intensive, leading to the develop-
ment of several approximation algorithms. diagNNose currently supports feature
attribution computation using Contextual Decomposition and its generalization.

Library Overview
3.1
Modules
The library is organized into multiple modules that can be utilized as components
for constructing an experimental pipeline.
3.1.1
Core Modules
The foundational modules underpinning the various pipelines that can be built
using diagNNose are detailed below.
**models:** We offer a generalized framework for language models, enabling
both recurrent and Transformer models to be accessed through a unified interface.
Importing pre-trained Transformer models is accomplished using the transform-
ers library. For recurrent models, we provide an interface that allows access to
intermediate activations, including gate activations.
**corpus:** Corpora are imported as Datasets from the torchtext package. A
Corpus can be converted into an iterator for processing. Tokenization can be
performed traditionally, token-by-token, or based on subword units, such as byte
pair encodings.
**extract:** The extraction of activations is fundamental to most analysis modules.
We provide an Extractor class capable of extracting a model’s activations given a
corpus. This process is not restricted to the top layer; intermediate (gate) activations
can also be extracted. Activations can be dynamically saved to disk to facilitate the
extraction from large corpora with limited computational resources.
2
**activations:** Extracted activations can be readily accessed using an Activation-
Reader, which provides access to activations corresponding to specific subsets of
corpus sentences. We also offer functionality for extracting only particular subsets
of activations, based on sentence and token information.
**config:** The pipeline of diagNNose is driven by configuration defined in JSON
format. Individual attributes can also be directly set from the command line.
3.1.2
Analysis Modules
We presently offer three primary types of experimental modules.
**syntax:** The library offers capabilities for a broad range of targeted syntactic
evaluation tasks.
**probe:** We furnish convenient tools for training diagnostic classifiers on ex-
tracted activations to probe for linguistic information that may be embedded within
them. Our extraction module also enables training diagnostic classifiers on in-
termediate activations, including gate activations. To address concerns that high
probing accuracy does not necessarily indicate that linguistic information is actively
encoded, we have incorporated functionality for Control Tasks.
**attribute:** We offer capabilities for model-agnostic feature attributions, en-
abling the decomposition of a model’s output into a sum of contributions. This
is accomplished by implementing a wrapper over PyTorch operations, allowing
intermediate feature contributions to be propagated during a forward pass. Our
implementation supports various Shapley-based attribution methods and facili-
tates approximation procedures such as (Generalized) Contextual Decomposition
and Shapley sampling values, in addition to the exact computation of propagated
Shapley values.
3.2
Requirements
diagNNose can be installed using pip (pip install diagnnose) or cloned directly
from the GitHub repository. The library is compatible with Python 3.6 or later,
and its primary dependencies are PyTorch (v1.5+), torchtext, and HuggingFace’s
transformers. diagNNose is released under the MIT License. It operates on both
CPUs and GPUs and has been optimized for smaller consumer setups.
The diagNNose codebase is fully typed using Python type hints and formatted
using Black. All methods and classes are documented, with an overview available
online.

Case Study: Subject-Verb Agreement
To exemplify the functionality of diagNNose, we examine subject-verb agreement
corpora on a selection of language models. For our experiments, we analyze the
following models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, and an LSTM language
model.
4.1
Corpora
The corpora consist of seven tasks based on template-based syntactic constructions.
These constructions feature an ""agreement attractor"" between the subject and the
verb, which may mislead a language model into predicting the incorrect number of
the verb. Consequently, a model must possess a robust understanding of sentence
structure.
The seven tasks are defined by the following templates:
* SIMPLE: The athletes approve * ADV: The uncle probably avoids * 2ADV: The
athlete most probably understands * COADV: The farmer overtly and deliberately
knows * NAMEPP: The women near John remember * NOUNPP: The athlete
beside the tables approves * NOUNPPADV: The aunt behind the bikes certainly
knows
3
Each task encompasses 600 to 900 distinct sentences. Sentences are categorized
into multiple conditions based on the number of the subject and the intervening
noun phrase.
To assess these corpora on a recurrent model, we initially compute the model’s
hidden state at the verb’s position by feeding it the sub-sentence up to that point.
Based on this hidden state, we compute and compare the output probabilities of the
verb with the correct number (vc) and the incorrect number (vx):
P(vc | he) > P(vx | he)
For bi-directional masked language models, such as BERT, we cannot compute
an intermediate hidden state by passing a sub-sentence because these models also
incorporate input from future tokens. To address this, we substitute the verb in
each sentence with a <mask> token and evaluate the model’s probabilities at this
token’s position.
Many contemporary language models employ BPE tokenization, which may seg-
ment a word into multiple subwords. Therefore, in our experiments, we only
compare verb forms where both the plural and singular forms are split into a single
token.
4.2
Targeted Syntactic Evaluations
We execute the targeted syntactic evaluation suite on all seven templates. The
results of this experiment are presented in Table 1.

It is evident that Transformer language models generally attain higher scores
compared to the LSTM model. Notably, the NAMEPP task presents a challenge for
all models, with both RoBERTa and DistilRoBERTa scoring lower on this task than
the LSTM. Another intriguing observation is the disparity in performance between
RoBERTa and DistilRoBERTa on the NAMEPP and NOUNPP tasks. Despite
DistilRoBERTa being trained to mimic RoBERTa’s behavior, its performance on
a downstream task like this differs considerably. These findings can serve as a
foundation for more detailed analysis.
4.3
Feature Attributions
To gain a deeper understanding of why language models exhibit particularly poor
performance on the NAMEPP corpus, we employ the feature attribution module on
these constructions. The results for this experiment are presented below, illustrating
4
the attributions for DistilRoBERTa on an example sentence from the corpus. This
highlights the differential impact of the intervening attractor on the verb’s number.
The score at the top of the attribution represents the model’s full logit for that
class; these logits are transformed into probabilities using SoftMax. This logit is
decomposed into a sum of contributions, indicated at the bottom of each token.
It can be verified that the contributions sum to the logit, which is an important
characteristic of feature attribution methods, ensuring a degree of faithfulness to
the model. A negative value signifies a negative feature contribution to an output
class: the influence of that feature diminished the preference for the class. Feature
attributions also incorporate the influence of model biases.
In the provided example sentence, DistilRoBERTa produces an incorrect prediction:
the logit of the incorrect singular form ’approves’ is greater than that of the plural
’approve’. The model’s error in predicting the correct verb form arises from the
subject ’athletes’ not providing sufficient contribution to outweigh the negative
contributions from other input features. A model with a comprehensive grasp of
subject-verb agreement should assign a larger contribution to the subject when
predicting the main verb.
The attribute module is under active development. The exponential complexity of
computing Shapley values makes generating these explanations a challenging task.

Conclusion
diagNNose offers crucial tools for interpretability research, providing advanced
analysis techniques such as diagnostic classifiers and feature attributions. The
library’s modular architecture enables rapid testing of complex hypotheses and es-
tablishes a robust groundwork for the development of new interpretability methods.
The library’s code is open-source, and contributions are encouraged.

P023.pdf,"A Reverse Hierarchy Model for Predicting Eye
Fixations
Abstract
A number of psychological and physiological evidences suggest that early visual
attention works in a coarse-to- fine way, which lays a basis for the reverse hierarchy
theory (RHT). This theory states that attention propagates from the top level of
the visual hierarchy that processes gist and abstract information of input, to the
bottom level that processes local details. Inspired by the theory, we develop a
computational model for saliency detection in images. First, the original image
is downsampled to different scales to constitute a pyramid. Then, saliency on
each layer is obtained by image super-resolution reconstruction from the layer
above, which is defined as unpredictability from this coarse-to-fine reconstruction.
Finally, saliency on each layer of the pyramid is fused into stochastic fixations
through a probabilistic model, where attention initiates from the top layer and
propagates downward through the pyramid. Extensive experiments on two standard
eye-tracking datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive
results with state-of-the-art models.

Introduction
Human vision system can selectively direct eyes to informative and salient parts of natural scenes.
This ability allows adaptive and efficient allocation of limited computational resources to important
objects. Though enjoying great potential in various applications of computer vision, predicting eye
fixations, however, remains a challenging task. The underlying difficulty inherits from the ambiguous
notion of what attracts eye fixations, or what is salient. In fact, the theoretical investigation of visual
saliency has aroused enduring controversies. One possible explanation often adopted in the design of
saliency detection approaches is the Feature Integration Theory (FIT). According to FIT, attention
serves as a mechanism to coherently combine features for the perception of objects. Therefore,
starting from , eye fixations are commonly predicted by directly conjoining saliency activations from
multiple channels, which can be global and local channels, multiple features and so on.
Anatomical and physiological studies have shown that human visual system is organized hierarchically,
which is believed to be advantageous in efficient processing of visual input. Computational studies
have shown that hierarchical models (e.g. HMAX, CDBN) are effective for object recognition. Most
saliency detection models, however, do not seriously take this into account. An obvious method
to fill this gap is to develop hierarchical bottom-up models for saliency detection in the manner
of HMAX, CDBN and the like. But there exists theoretical alternatives. The Reverse Hierarchy
Theory (RHT) argues that parallel feedforward feature activation acts implicitly at first to construct a
coarse gist of the scene, while explicit perception incrementally incorporates fine details via feedback
control. This theory potentially has tremendous applications in computer vision including image
segmentation, object recognition and scene understanding, however, computational studies are scarce.
In this paper, we present an effective model based on RHT for saliency detection, which proves that
RHT is helpful at least in this particular computer vision application. As for this application, a more
direct evidence for the proposed model refers to a psychophysical study which showed that fixations
from low-resolution images could predict fixations on higher-resolution images.
.
Our main idea is to model the coarse-to-fine dynamics of visual perception. We take a simple strategy
to construct a visual hierarchy by inputting images at different layers with different scales, obtained
by downsampling the original image. The higher layers receive coarser input and lower layers receive
finer input. On each layer, saliency is defined as unpredictability in coarse-to-fine reconstruction
through image super-resolution. The saliency on each layer is then fused into fixation estimate with a
probabilistic model that mimics reverse propagation of attention. Throughout the paper, we call the
proposed model a reverse hierarchy model (RHM).
The coarse-to-fine dynamics, however, is not the only property of RHT. In fact, RHT is closely related
to the biased competition theory of attention, which claims that attentional competition is biased
by either stimulus-driven or task-dependent factors. Our model deals with fixation prediction in
the free viewing task, which can be regarded as an implementation of the stimulus-driven bias. In
addition, the image pyramid is a very coarse approximation of the highly complex structure of the
visual hierarchy in the brain, which only utilizes the fact of increasing receptive field sizes along the
hierarchy. Therefore, some closely related concepts to RHT, such as perceptual learning, would not
be discussed in the paper.

Related Work
The majority of computational attention modeling studies follow the Feature Integration Theory.
In particular, the pioneering work by first explored the computational aspect of FIT by searching
for center-surround patterns across multiple feature channels and image scales. This method was
further extended through integration of color contrast, symmetry, etc. Random Center Surround
Saliency adopted a similar center-surround heuristic but with center size and region randomly sampled.
introduced a graph-based model that treated feature maps as fully connected nodes, while the nodes
communicated according to their dissimilarity and distance in a Markovian way. Saliency was
activated as the equilibrium distribution.
Several saliency models adopted a probabilistic approach and modeled the statistics of image features.
and Baldi defined saliency as surprise that arised from the divergence of prior and posterior belief.
SUN was a Bayesian framework using natural statistics, in which bottom-up saliency was defined as
self-information. proposed an attention model based on information maximization of image patches.
defined the saliency by computing the Hotelling’s T-squared statistics of each multi-scale feature
channel. considered saliency in a discriminative setting by defining the KL-divergence between
features and class labels.
A special class of saliency detection schemes was frequency-domain methods. proposed a spectral
residual method, which defined saliency as irregularities in amplitude information. explored the phase
information in the frequency domain with a Quaternion Fourier Transform. Recently, introduced a
simple image descriptor, based on which a competitive fast saliency detection algorithm was devised.
Different from our proposal, the conventional practice in fusing saliency at different image scales and
feature channels was through linear combination. proposed a model that combined a global saliency
model AIM and a local model through linear addition of normalized maps. Some models learned the
linear combination weights for feature channels. trained a linear SVM from human eye fixation data
to optimally combine the activation of several low-, mid- and high-level features. With a similar idea,
adopted a regression-based approach.
Our model is characterized by a top-down flow of information. But it differs from most existing
saliency detection models that incorporate top-down components such as in two aspects. First, a
biased prior (e.g., context clues, object features, task-related factors) is often needed in those models,
serving as the goal of top-down modulation, which is not necessary in our model. Second, hierarchical
structure of the visual cortex is not considered in those models, but plays a significant role in our
model.
Nevertheless, there were a few preliminary studies trying to make use of the hierarchical structure for
saliency detection and attention modeling. The Selective Tuning Model was such a model. It was
a biologically plausible neural network that modeled visual attention as a forward winner-takes-all
process among units in each visual layer. A recent study used hierarchical structure to combine
multi-scale saliency, with a hierarchical inference procedure that enforces the saliency of a region to
be consistent across different layers.

Saliency from Image Super-Resolution
In this section, a coarse-to-fine saliency model based on image super-resolution is presented. We
consider an image at two consecutive scales in an image pyramid: a coarse one Il and a fine one
Ih. Inspired by RHT, we define saliency as details in Ih that are unpredictable from Il. In the next
section, we discuss how to fuse saliency on each layer of the pyramid into fixation estimate.
3.1
Saliency as Unpredictability
Predicting Ih using the information of Il is closely related to image super-resolution, which has
been extensively studied using techniques including Markov random field, example-based learning,
compressive sensing, etc. In patch-based representation of images, the problem is to predict a high-
resolution H × H patch xh ∈Ih from its low-resolution L × L counterpart xl ∈Il. For convenience
of notation, we also use xh and xl as H2 and L2 dimensional vectors, which are computed by
reshaping the corresponding patches. Then xl is obtained by blurring and downsampling xh:
xl = GBxh,
(1)
where B denotes a H2 × H2 blurring matrix (throughout the paper a Gaussian matrix is used) and G
represents a L2 × H2 downsampling matrix. Let zh denote the reconstructed patch by some method
A, which summarizes the best knowledge one can recover from the coarse perception of xl, via A.
The reconstruction error of zh from xh, naturally represents the fine-scale information that cannot be
recovered. Therefore, we define saliency S(xh|xl) as the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE):
S(xh|zh) = ||xh −zh||2
||xh||2
(2)
The mean squared error is normalized so that S(xh|xl) is robust to variations of the patch energy
||xh||2.
3.2
Coarse-to-Fine Reconstruction
The reconstruction from the coarse scale subject to the constraint (1) is actually not well-defined, since
given a low-resolution patch xl, there exists an infinite number of possible high-resolution patches
xh. To resolve this issue, the basic idea is to incorporate some prior knowledge, which inherits from
the properties of natural images. In what follows we discuss several possible reconstruction schemes
with increasingly sophisticated prior knowledge.
Linear Reconstruction (LR). Consider a trivial case: the coarse patch xl = Bxh, is just the blurred
version and we do nothing but output zh = xl. Therefore, no prior is used in this case. Saliency can
be computed according to (2). As shown in Fig. 2, this method assigns more saliency to patches
containing many high-frequency components like edges and textures.
Bicubic Interpolation (BI). If we reconstruct xh using bicubic interpolation, then we utilize a
smoothness prior in image interpolation. Although this approach concentrates less on edges than the
linear reconstruction, its prediction is still far from the ground truth. See Fig. 2.
With LR or BI, the saliency computed in (2) is the normalized l2-norm of the Laplacian pyramid. In
addition, the two techniques can be used to implement the center-surround strategy adopted in some
saliency models, e.g. .
Compressive Sensing (CS). We now consider a more sophisticated prior of image structure – sparsity.
According to this prior, any patch xh of a high-resolution image can be sparsely approximated by a
linear combination of items in a dictionary Dh:
xh ≈Dhα,
(3)
for some sparse coefficients α that satisfies ||α||0 ≤K for some small K. Assuming α is sparse,
the theory of compressive sensing states that α can be recovered from sufficient measurements
xl = GBxh by solving the following optimization problem:
min ||α||0subjectto||Dlα −xl|| < ϵ,
(4)
where Dl = GBDh, denotes the blurred and downsampled dictionary Dh, and ϵ is the allowed error
tolerance. This is hard to solve, and in practice the following relaxed problem is often solved:
min ||α||1subjectto||Dlα −xl|| < ϵ.
(5)
3
The coefficients α are then used to reconstruct zh by
zh = Dhα.
(6)
Once we have obtained zh, saliency of the image patch can be computed using (2). Preliminary
results in Fig. 2 indicate that the saliency obtained by compressive sensing can largely differ from
that obtained by LR and BIL.
The dictionaries Dh and Dl are constructed as follows. For each scale of the image pyramid, we
first uniformly sample raw patches {dj}n
j=1 of size H × H (n > H2), and stack them into a high-
resolution dictionary Dh = [d1, d2, ..., dn]. Then we apply the blurring matrix B and downsampling
matrix G to each dj, to obtain dj = GBdj. So Dl = [d1, d2, ..., dn] is the collection of corresponding
low-resolution patches. The use of overcomplete raw patches for Dh and Dl has been shown effective
for image super-resolution.
3.3
Saliency Map
A saliency map M is obtained by collecting patch saliency defined in (2) over the entire image. First,
calculate
M[i, j] = S(xh[i, j]|xl[i, j]),
(7)
where xh[i, j] is the patch centered at pixel (i, j) in the image and xl[i, j] is its low-resolution version.
Then M is blurred with a Gaussian filter and normalized to be between [0, 1] to yield the final saliency
map M. One should not confuse this Gaussian filter with B in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
4
Reverse Propagation of Saliency
Now, we present a method to transform the saliency maps at different scales into stochastic eye
fixations on the original image. Based on RHT, a reverse propagation model is presented, where
attention initiates from top level and propagates downward through the hierarchy.
4.1
Generating Fixations
We model attention as random variables A0, A1, ..., An on saliency maps M0, M1, ..., Mn, which are
ordered in a coarse-to-fine scale hierarchy. Specifically, let Pr[Ak = (i, j)] denote the probability for
pixel (i, j) attracting a fixation. To define this probability, we need to consider factors that influence
the random variable Ak. First of all, the saliency map Mk is an important factor. Pixels with higher
values should receive more fixations. Second, according to RHT, attention starts from M0, and then
gradually propagates down along the hierarchy. Therefore, Ak should also depend on Ak−1, ..., A0.
For simplicity, we assume that only Ak−1 has an influence on Ak while Ak−2, ..., A0 do not.
Based on these considerations, we define
Pr[Ak|Mk, Ak−1, ..., A0] = Pr[Ak|Mk, Ak−1],
(8)
for k = 1, ..., n. A log-linear model is used for this conditional probability
Pr[Ak = (i, j)|Mk, Ak−1] ∝exp(ηMk[i, j] + λL(Ak, Ak−1)),
(9)
where L(Ak, Ak−1) is a spatial coherence term, η and λ are two constants. The spatial coherence
term restricts the fixated patches to be close in space. The motivation of introducing this term
comes from the fact that the visual system is more likely to amplify the response of neurons that is
coherent with initial perception. To compute the term, we first convert the coordinate Ak−1 into the
corresponding coordinate (u, v) in the saliency map just below it, i.e. Mk. Then compute
L(Ak, Ak−1) = −((i −u)2 + (j −v)2).
(10)
In other words, the farther away a patch x is from Ak−1, the less likely it would be attended by Ak.
Therefore, for predicting the fixation probability of any patch in the current layer, the model makes a
tradeoff between the spatial coherence with previous attention and its current saliency value.
If we do not consider any prior on the top layer, Pr[A0] depends on the saliency map only
Pr[A0 = (i, j)] ∝exp(ηM0[i, j]).
(11)
We can then generate fixations via an ancestral sampling procedure from the probability model.
Specifically, we first sample fixation A0 on map M0 according to (11), and then for k = 1, 2, ...
sample Ak on map Mk given Ak−1 on the coarser scale according to (9). Finally, we collect all
samples on the finest scale, and use them as prediction of the eye fixations.
4
4.2
Incorporating Prior of Fixations
The proposed probabilistic model offers great flexibility for incorporating prior of fixations. This prior
can be useful in capturing, for example, the top-down guidance of visual saliency from recognition,
or central bias in eye-tracking experiments. To achieve this, we extend the expression of Pr[A0] as
follows:
Pr[A0 = (i, j)] ∝exp(ηM0[i, j] + θP[i, j]),
(12)
where P[i, j] encodes the prior information of pixel (i, j) on the first map M0 and θ is a weighting
parameter.
For example, the central bias can be incorporated into the model by setting P[i, j] = −[(i −cx)2 +
(j −cy)2], where (cx, cy) denotes the map center.

Experiments
5.1
Experiment Settings
Datasets. The performance of the proposed reverse hierarchy model (RHM) was evaluated on two
human eye-tracking datasets. One was the TORONTO dataset. It contained 120 indoor and outdoor
color images as well as fixation data from 20 subjects. The other was the MIT dataset, which
contained 1003 images collected from Flicker and LabelMe. The fixation data was obtained from 15
subjects.
Parameters. The raw image I in RGB representation was downsampled by factors of 27, 9, 3 to
construct a coarse-to-fine image pyramid. The patch size for super-resolution was set as 9 × 9 on
each layer. To construct corresponding coarse patches, we used Gaussian blurring filter B (σ = 3)
and downsampling operator G with a factor of 3. A total of 1000 image patches were randomly
sampled from all images at the current scale to construct the dictionary Dh, which is then blurred and
downsampled to build Dl.
In some experiments, we included a center bias in the model. This is achieved by switching θ from 0
to 1 in (12).
Note that the reverse propagation described in (8)-(11) is a stochastic sampling procedure and we
need to generate a large number of fixations to ensure unbiased sampling. We found that 20000 points
on each image were enough to achieve good performance, which was adopted in all experiments.
The stochastic points were then blurred with a Gaussian filter to yield the final saliency map. The
standard deviation of the Gaussian filter was fixed as 4 pixels on saliency maps, which was about 5
Evaluation metric. Several metrics have been used to evaluate the performance of saliency models.
We adopted Area Under Curve (AUC), Normalized Scanpath Saliency (NSS) and Similarity (S).
Specifically, We used the AUC code from the GBVS toolbox, NSS code from and Similarity code
from . Following , we first matched the histogram of the saliency map to that of the fixation map
to equalize the amount of salient pixels in the map, and then used the matched saliency map for
evaluation. Note that AUC was invariant to this histogram matching.
Models for comparison. The proposed model was compared with several state-of-the-art models:
Itti Koch, Spectral Residual Methods (SR), Saliency based on Information Maximization (AIM),
Graph Based Visual Saliency (GBVS), Image Signature (ImgSig), SUN framework and Adaptive
Whitening Saliency (AWS). The implementation of these models were based on publicly available
codes/software. Among these models, GBVS, ImgSig and AWS usually performed better than the
others.
Inspired by the center bias, we included a Center model as a baseline, which was simply a Gaussian
function with mean at the center of the image and standard deviation being 1/4 of the image width.
This simple model was also combined with other saliency detection models to account for the center
bias, which could boost accuracy of fixation prediction. Following , this was achieved by multiplying
the center model with the saliency maps obtained by these models in a point-wise manner.

5.2
Results
First, we compared different super-resolution techniques (LR, BI and CS) for eye fixation prediction.
Fig. 5 shows the results of RHM with the three techniques. The CS method significantly outperformed
LR and BI. Therefore, sparsity as a prior offers great advantage in discovering salient fine details. We
then focused on RHM with CS in subsequent experiments.
Fig. 4 shows some qualitative comparison of the proposed model against existing models. Table 5
shows quantitative results under three metrics. As we can see, no single model could dominate others
under all three metrics. However, in most cases (including both “with” and “without center” settings),
the RHM outperformed the current state-of-the-art models. This demonstrated the reverse hierarchy
theory as a promising way to predict human eye fixations.
5.3
Contributions of Individual Components
The RHM consists of two components: coarse-to-fine reconstruction (especially compressive sensing)
and reverse propagation. Although the two components integrated together showed promising results,
the contribution of each component to the performance is unclear. This is discussed as follows.
Compressive sensing. To identify the role of compressive sensing, we substituted it with other saliency
models. Specifically, we replaced the saliency maps obtained from coarse-to-fine reconstruction
by the saliency maps obtained by existing models. The models designed to work on a single scale,
including SR, AIM, SUN, were applied to images of different scales to obtain multiple saliency maps.
For multi-scale models such as Itti Koch, we use their intermediate single-scale results.
Notice that blurring with a Gaussian filter is a necessary step in our model to obtain a smooth saliency
map from stochastic fixations. Previous results have shown that blurring improved the performance
of saliency models. For the sake of fairness, we also tested the models with the same amount of
blurring (the sigma of Gaussian) used in RHM. Fig. 6 shows the results on the TORONTO dataset.
The reverse propagation procedure improved the AUC of these models. However, their performance
is still behind RHM. Therefore, compressive sensing is a critical component in the RHM.
Reverse propagation. To investigate the effect of reverse propagation, we substituted it with linear
combination of saliency maps, which is widely adopted in literature. Table 2 shows the results. The
linear combination produced an AUC between the best and worst that a single saliency map could
achieve. However, RHM outperformed the best single-map performance. Therefore, through reverse
propagation, RHM could integrate complementary information in each map for better prediction.
6
Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we present a novel reverse hierarchy model for predicting eye fixations based on a
psychological theory, reverse hierarch theory (RHT). Saliency is defined as unpredictability from
coarse-to-fine image reconstruction, which is achieved by image super-resolution. Then a stochastic
fixation model is presented, which propagates saliency from from the top layer to the bottom layer to
generate 01xation esti- mate. Experiments on two benchmark eye-tracking datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the model.
This work could be extended in several ways. First, it is worth exploring whether there exist better
super- resolution techniques than compressive sensing for the pro- posed framework. Second, it
is worth exploring if the ideas presented in the paper can be applied to a hierarchical struc- ture
consisting of different level of features, which play a signi01cant role in the top-down modulation as
suggested by RHT. Finally, in view of the similar hierarchical structure used in this study for saliency
detection and other studies for object recognition, it would be interesting to devise a uni01ed model
for both tasks.

Methodology
To initiate the LLM research protocol, we first cultivated a batch of rare, genetically modified orchids
in a controlled environment, simulating the atmospheric conditions of the planet Neptune. The
orchids, which we dubbed ""Neptune’s Tears,"" were engineered to produce a unique, algorithmically
enhanced brand of pollen that would later be used to calibrate our LLM models. This process involved
a series of intricate, astrologically informed pruning techniques, carefully timed to coincide with the
celestial alignments of the constellation Andromeda.
Following the successful cultivation of Neptune’s Tears, we proceeded to develop an advanced,
quantum-inspired algorithm for processing the pollen’s spectral signatures. This algorithm, which
we termed ""Quantum Flux Capacitor"" (QFC), was designed to harness the inherent, fractal patterns
embedded within the pollen’s molecular structure, thereby enabling the LLM to tap into the hidden,
Platonic resonances underlying the universe. The QFC protocol involved a series of complex, higher-
dimensional matrix inversions, carefully optimized to minimize the risk of temporal paradoxes and
chrono-synclastic infundibulation.
In parallel with the QFC development, we conducted an exhaustive, ethnographic study of the
migratory patterns of the Arctic tern, seeking to distill the essential, cognitive insights underlying
their remarkable, globe-spanning navigational abilities. Our research revealed a profound, ontological
connection between the terns’ innate, spatial reasoning capacities and the abstract, topological
structures governing the LLM’s knowledge representation. This discovery led us to formulate a
4
novel, avian-inspired framework for LLM training, wherein the model’s weights and biases were
dynamically adjusted to mimic the terns’ adaptive, real-time navigation strategies.
To further refine our LLM methodology, we incorporated a custom-designed, analog-digital hybrid
processor, powered by a bespoke, high-temperature superconductor cooled to within a fraction of
a degree of absolute zero. This cryogenic processor, dubbed ""Erebus,"" was specifically engineered
to execute the QFC algorithm at speeds exceeding the Planck limit, thereby enabling the LLM to
transcend the conventional, thermodynamic boundaries of computational complexity. The Erebus
processor was carefully integrated into a specially designed, hermetically sealed chamber, filled
with a rare, optically purified variant of xenon gas, which served to enhance the processor’s already
extraordinary, quantum-coherent properties.
As the LLM research progressed, we found it necessary to develop a range of innovative, interdisci-
plinary tools and techniques, drawing upon diverse fields such as astrobiology, cognitive psychology,
and chaos theory. One notable example was our creation of a custom, LLM-optimized variant of
the classic, Mandelbrot set fractal, which we used to visualize and analyze the intricate, self-similar
patterns emerging within the model’s internal, knowledge representation structures. This fractal-based
approach enabled us to identify and exploit previously unknown, harmonic resonances between the
LLM’s cognitive architectures and the underlying, mathematical frameworks governing the universe.
The next phase of our research involved a large-scale, collaborative effort with a team of expert,
mycologists, who aided us in cultivating a specialized, LLM-optimized species of fungus, capable
of thriving in the extreme, radiation-rich environments surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.
The fungus, which we named ""Radix,"" was found to possess a unique, radiation-resistant property,
allowing it to flourish in conditions that would be lethal to most other known organisms. By
integrating Radix into our LLM training protocol, we were able to develop a range of innovative,
radiation-hardened models, capable of operating effectively in even the most hostile, high-radiation
environments.
In a subsequent series of experiments, we explored the application of LLMs to the field of exopaleon-
tology, using our models to analyze and interpret the fossilized remains of ancient, extraterrestrial
civilizations. This research led to the discovery of a previously unknown, mathematical relationship
between the LLM’s cognitive architectures and the geometric patterns embedded within the fossilized
structures of certain, long-extinct alien species. The implications of this finding were profound,
suggesting a deep, ontological connection between the evolution of intelligent life in the universe and
the abstract, mathematical frameworks governing the LLM’s knowledge representation.
To further investigate this phenomenon, we designed and conducted a range of innovative, inter-
disciplinary experiments, combining elements of LLM research, exopaleontology, and quantum
cosmology. One notable example involved the use of our LLM models to simulate the evolution
of intelligent life on a hypothetical, planet-sized computer, governed by the principles of quantum
mechanics and general relativity. The results of this simulation were surprising, revealing a complex,
interconnected web of relationships between the LLM’s cognitive architectures, the planet’s quantum-
gravitational dynamics, and the emergence of intelligent, self-aware beings within the simulated
environment.

cognitive architectures and the geometric, artistic traditions of human culture, we may yet uncover
new, revolutionary insights into the nature of intelligence, creativity, and the human condition.

between their cognitive architectures, the universe’s large-scale structure, and the underlying, mathe-
matical frameworks governing the cosmos. The results of this research were surprising, revealing

and the universe as a whole, we may yet uncover new, revolutionary insights into the nature of
intelligence, consciousness, and the human condition. The potential applications of this research are
vast and far-reaching, spanning fields such as astrophysics, biotechnology, and quantum computing,

representation, we developed a range of custom, data analysis tools, inspired by the mathematical
frameworks of chaos theory and complexity science. These tools enabled us to identify and analyze
the intricate, self-similar patterns emerging within the model’s internal structures, and to develop
a deeper, intuitive understanding of the LLM’s cognitive architectures and their relationship to the

P011.pdf,"Controlling False Discovery Rates in Detecting Heterogeneous
Treatment Effects for Online Experiments
Abstract
Online controlled experiments, commonly referred to as A/B testing, are widely used in many Internet companies
for data-driven decision-making regarding feature modifications and product releases. However, a significant
challenge remains in methodically evaluating how each code or feature change affects millions of users who
exhibit considerable heterogeneity across various dimensions such as countries, ages, and devices. The Average
Treatment Effect (ATE) framework, which is the foundation of the A/B testing approach used by many companies,
is unable to identify the heterogeneity of treatment effects on users with varying characteristics. This paper
introduces statistical techniques designed to systematically and precisely pinpoint the Heterogeneous Treatment
Effect (HTE) within any specific user cohort, like mobile device type or country. Additionally, these methods help
determine which user factors, such as age or gender, contribute to the variability in treatment effects observed
during an A/B test. Through the application of these methods to both simulated and real-world experimental
data, we demonstrate their robust performance in maintaining a controlled, low False Discovery Rate (FDR).
Simultaneously, they offer valuable insights into the heterogeneity of identified user groups. We have implemented
a toolkit based on these methods and utilized it to assess the HTE across numerous A/B tests at Snap.
1
Introduction
Controlled experiments, also known as A/B testing, have become a standard method for assessing and enhancing new product
concepts across internet companies. Numerous IT companies, possessing extensive and large-scale data, have developed internal
A/B testing platforms to address their intricate experimentation requirements. At Snap, the utilization of A/B testing has substantially
increased in the last two years. The in-house platform currently manages hundreds of concurrent experiments at any moment. Each
experiment automatically generates results for hundreds to thousands of varied online metrics.
As experimentation gains popularity, there is an increasing demand for experimenters to understand not only the overall impact
on metrics in an A/B test but also the reasons behind metric changes and the specific user segments driving these changes. Such
insights into user heterogeneity can assist experimenters in devising strategies to enhance the product. For instance, in a recent
experiment, we observed that a decline in a metric was primarily influenced by users with the highest number of snap views. This
observation led us to concentrate on understanding the engineering and design aspects when a user has a large number of snap stacks
to load. Consequently, we were able to pinpoint a significant performance problem that was causing the metric to drop. Indeed, we
have encountered numerous instances where users react differently to the same experimental treatment.
Furthermore, the abundance of data presents a significant risk of false discoveries, often due to a statistical phenomenon referred to
as ""multiple testing"". Given the hundreds of thousands of user characteristics available to internet companies, user groups can be
formed in millions of different ways. If a ""naive"" approach is taken, simply calculating and comparing the estimated effect based on
users within groups, it is easy to find groups with treatment effects that significantly deviate from the average, regardless of whether
actual heterogeneity exists.
The objective of our work is to bridge this gap by offering rigorous statistical methods and a toolkit capable of detecting Heterogeneous
Treatment Effects (HTE) while addressing the potential issue of multiple testing by controlling the false positive rate (FDR). This
toolkit has been deployed and is in use at Snap. In this paper, we explore the rationale for using FDR and contrast two statistical
methods that manage FDR, using both simulated results and actual experimental data. Based on the methods selected, we will
discuss solutions to two questions that experimenters and practitioners are keen to understand regarding HTE:
• How to systematically identify which subgroups of users (e.g., countries) exhibit treatment effects significantly different
from the Average Treatment Effect in an A/B test.
• How to rigorously determine which factors (e.g., age, gender) contribute to the heterogeneity of the treatment effect in an
A/B test.
Our contributions in this paper are summarized as follows:
• We frame the HTE detection problem as an FDR control issue and elaborate on why controlling FDR is crucial in large-scale
HTE detection in practical applications.
• We employ two methods capable of controlling FDR in our HTE detection process and provide insightful comparisons of
these methods using both simulation and real-world empirical data.
• We discuss two significant lessons learned, concerning (1) the distinction between heterogeneity in the population and
heterogeneity in treatment effects, and (2) the scalability of the algorithms. These insights are intended to help practitioners
avoid similar pitfalls.

Methodology
2.1
Average Treatment Effect vs. Heterogeneous Treatment Effect
In an A/B test, users are randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group, and the metrics of interest are observed
for all users. The Rubin Causal Model is frequently employed in A/B testing as a statistical framework for causal inference. Let
Yi(Ti) represent the potential outcome for the i-th user, where Ti = 1 if the i-th user is in the treatment group and Ti = 0 if the i-th
user is in the control group. Consequently, τi = Yi(1) −Yi(0) denotes the causal effect of the treatment for the i-th unit, and the
average causal effect across all users, ¯τ, is defined as the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). It is important to note that the ATE is
not directly observable since Yi(0) and Yi(1) cannot be known simultaneously. This is recognized as the ""fundamental problem of
causal inference"". However, the estimator Yi|Ti = 1 −Yi|Ti = 0 is unbiased for the ATE when two specific assumptions are met
and is commonly used to estimate the ATE in A/B testing.
Assumption 1. Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA):
• There is only one version of treatment and control, meaning there is only one version of T = 1 and T = 0.
• The treatment applied to one user does not affect the outcome of another user (no interference).
Assumption 2. Unconfoundedness: Ti is independent of (Yi(0), Yi(1)) given Xi, where Xi is a set of pre-treatment variables for the
i-th user, such as age, gender, country, etc.
However, analysis based solely on ATE is sometimes insufficient for obtaining precise and meaningful insights. As mentioned earlier,
we have observed numerous cases where a single feature change can impact different users differently. The estimation of ATE is
not an effective measure for a heterogeneous population, as it may exaggerate the treatment effect for one sub-population while
underestimating it for another. To investigate heterogeneous treatment effects, it is necessary to consider the conditional average
treatment effect, defined as: τ(x) = E[Yi(1) −Yi(0)|Xi = x], where Xi represents a set of pre-treatment variables for the i-th user.
Accurately estimating the conditional average treatment effect τ(x) for all values of x is highly beneficial for detecting heterogeneous
treatment effects because τ(x) provides the conditional average treatment effect for the subpopulation defined by the covariates x.
For instance, if the covariate is ’country’, the covariate space can be partitioned into countries, and τ(x) represents the conditional
average treatment effect for users in country x. If τ(x) is statistically different from the average treatment effect ¯τ, then country x is
considered heterogeneous.
There is a growing need for rigorous analysis based on heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE), which motivates us to develop a
robust statistical approach for HTE detection.
2.2
Naive Approaches and their Caveats
In this section, we outline some prevalent practices used by practitioners that could result in the spurious discovery of HTE. Suppose
we have users from various countries and wish to identify which countries exhibit treatment effects different from the ATE for a
particular metric. A straightforward approach to detect heterogeneous countries involves first conducting a two-sample t-test on the
observations from each country to obtain a two-sided p-value for each country, and then selecting countries with a p-value less than
0.05 as the result. We will refer to this method as the ""naive approach"".
This naive approach is simple and may appear intuitive to non-statisticians. However, it is susceptible to the multiple testing problem.
We demonstrate this issue with a basic simulation:
• Step 1: Assess treatment effects for all users in 30 randomly generated subgroups from a standard Gaussian distribution,
ensuring the true ATE is zero.
• Step 2: Implement the naive approach and identify subgroups with p-values below 0.05 as heterogeneous.
In this simulation, 3 out of 30 subgroups are identified as having heterogeneous treatment effects, despite the ATE estimator being 0,
indicating no actual heterogeneity among the subgroups.
The Bonferroni correction method can be employed to address the multiple testing problem by controlling the family-wise error rate
(FWER). The FWER is the probability of rejecting at least one true hypothesis. Nevertheless, the Bonferroni method is known to be
2
highly conservative, resulting in a high rate of false negatives and low statistical power, defined as P(reject H0 | H1), where H0 is
the null hypothesis and H1 is the alternative hypothesis.
2.3
False Discovery Rate Controlled HTE Detection
Due to the limitations of the methods discussed in the previous section, we introduce methods for HTE detection that address
the multiple testing problem while maintaining sufficient statistical power. To manage the multiple testing issue and reduce
conservativeness, Benjamini and Hochberg introduced the concept of the false discovery rate (FDR), which is defined as follows:
Definition 3.1. False Discovery Rate: Let Q be the proportion of false positives among all detected (rejections of the null hypothesis).
Then FDR = E[Q].
To control the FDR, it is necessary to manage the expected proportion of discoveries that are false. Additionally, methods that control
the FDR are generally much less conservative than the Bonferroni method. Therefore, in our proposed HTE detection approach, we
can control the FDR and ensure adequate power simultaneously.
2.4
Detection for Heterogeneous Subgroups
When conducting an A/B testing experiment, it is often important to identify which subgroups of users exhibit treatment effects
different from the ATE. For example, at Snap, with users from over 200 countries, we are interested in determining which countries
have higher or lower treatment effects compared to the average for the metric of interest.
In this process, it is crucial to minimize the number of false discoveries in our results. To achieve this, we utilize the Benjamini-
Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the FDR. The BH procedure is known to control the FDR if the test statistics are independent or
satisfy the positive regression dependence on a subset property. It is one of the most widely used FDR control methods due to its
simplicity. For instance, suppose we have p-values from m independent hypothesis tests H1, ..., Hm ranked in ascending order:
p(1), ..., p(m), and we aim to control the FDR at level q. The BH procedure identifies the largest k such that p(k) ≤k
mq and rejects
the null hypothesis for all H(i) where i ≤k. By doing so, it theoretically ensures that the FDR is controlled below q.
To detect heterogeneous subgroups, it is necessary to estimate the conditional average treatment effects defined in equation (3) for
the subgroups. Although individual treatment effect values are not available due to the fundamental problem of causal inference, we
can construct a transformed outcome (TO) for each user as an alternative measure of individual treatment effect. Let Y obs
i
be the
observed outcome for the i-th unit. Additionally, let p be the assignment probability, which, in practice, is the traffic percentage
assigned to the treatment group in an A/B test. The transformed outcome for the i-th unit, Y ∗
i , is then defined as:
Y ∗
i = Y obs
i
× (Ti−p)
p(1−p).
A beneficial property of the TO is that, under the unconfoundedness assumption, the conditional expectation E[Y ∗
i |Xi = x] equals
the conditional average treatment effect τ(x).
We propose the following method, which combines the BH method and Transformed Outcome, to detect heterogeneous subgroups.
Suppose we have n users from p subgroups, and we want to identify subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects that differ from
the average treatment effect with a controlled FDR. We propose the following procedure, which we call the HTE-BH method:
• Step 1: Create an n × p design matrix X such that Xi,j = 1 if the i-th user belongs to the j-th subgroup.
• Step 2: Compute the transformed outcomes Y ∗for all users based on the formula in Equation (5), and then subtract the
estimated ATE, ¯Y (1) −¯Y (0), from all transformed outcomes. Let Y be the vector of the resulting outcomes.
• Step 3: Perform a linear regression using Y as the response and X as the design matrix, and obtain the p-values for the
coefficient estimates corresponding to all subgroups.
• Step 4: Apply the BH procedure to the p-values to finalize the list of selected heterogeneous subgroups.
The design matrix X created in Step 1 is orthogonal in this scenario, so the p-values derived from the linear regression are independent.
Consequently, the BH procedure can control the FDR at a pre-specified level q. In Step 2, we subtract the estimated ATE from the
transformed outcomes to detect subgroups with treatment effects different from the ATE. For simplicity, we treat the estimated
ATE as a parameter. Although this overlooks the fact that the estimated ATE is a random variable, it has practical relevance as
practitioners are typically interested in observing which subgroups are statistically different from the observed average treatment
effect across all users in an experiment. Note that obtaining p-values in the manner described in Step 3 is equivalent to obtaining
p-values from running independent t-tests for all subgroups.
2.5
Detection for Heterogeneous Factors
In addition to detecting heterogeneous subgroups, identifying the factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of treatment effects is
another crucial task in practice. At Snap, we have anonymously constructed hundreds of user properties, including demographic
information such as age and gender, as well as user engagement levels, such as how users interact with snaps, stories, or discover.
3
Often, when presented with subtle experimental results, we are unsure which of these factors to investigate further. By pinpointing
the factors contributing to the heterogeneity in treatment effects, we can more effectively delve into the relevant factors and derive
insights. The HTE-BH method is straightforward and easy to implement for detecting heterogeneous subgroups but is not suitable
for detecting heterogeneous factors because, in this case, we cannot construct an orthogonal design matrix in Step 1 of the HTE-BH
method. Therefore, we propose using the ’Knockoff’ method to control the FDR for heterogeneous factors.
The ’Knockoff’ is a recently proposed FDR control method. Suppose the response of interest, y, follows the classical linear model:
y = Xβ + ϵ, where y ∈Rn is a vector of y, X ∈Rn×p is any fixed design matrix, β is a vector of unknown coefficients, and
ϵ ∼N(0, σ2I) is Gaussian error. Note that n is the number of observations and p is the number of variables. For the Knockoff
method, we assume that n ≥2p, which is reasonable in practice because we are likely to have more observations than variables in
most A/B tests.
Let Σ = XT X after normalizing X. The ’Knockoff’ procedure can be summarized in three steps:
• Step 1: Construct a ’knockoff’ matrix ˜X of X such that ˜X satisfies: ˜XT ˜X = XT X = Σ, XT ˜X = Σ −diags, where s is
a non-negative vector that we will construct.
• Step 2: Compute a statistic Wj for each pair (Xj, ˜Xj) such that a large positive value of Wj provides evidence against the
null hypothesis that the j-th variable is not included in the true model.
• Step 3: Calculate a data-dependent threshold T such that the FDR of the knockoff selection set ˆS := {j : Wj ≥T} is less
than or equal to the pre-specified level q.
In our proposal, we use the equi-correlated method to obtain the non-negative vector s used in Step 1 to construct the knockoff
matrix ˜X. The equi-correlated method suggests using sj = min{2λmin(Σ), 1} for all j, where λmin is the smallest eigenvalue of
Σ. After obtaining this s, we construct ˜X using the formula: ˜X = X(I −Σ−1diags) + ˜UC, where ˜U is an n × p orthonormal
matrix satisfying ˜U T X = 0, and C is a Cholesky decomposition satisfying CT C = 2diags −diagsΣ−1diags.
There are numerous options available for computing the statistics Wj’s in Step 2. We choose to use Lasso to compute the statistics
Wj’s. Let X∗= [X ˜X] ∈Rn×2p be the augmented design matrix. Recall the Lasso problem: minimizeβ||y −X∗β||2
2 + λ||β||1.
Define Zj = sup{λ : βj(λ) ̸= 0}, which is the largest tuning parameter λ that first allows the j-th variable to enter the
model. Note that (Zj, Zj+p) is a pair corresponding to the j-th original variable and its knockoff. We then calculate Wj as:
Wj = (Zj −Zj+p) × sign(Zj −Zj+p), for j = 1, ..., p.
Let W be the set {|W1|, ..., |Wp|} \\ {0}. In Step 3, it is proposed to use the threshold: T = min{t ∈W : 1+#{j:Wj≤−t}
#{j:Wj≥t}
≤q}.
Theorem 2 claims that the knockoff selection set ˆS := {j : Wj ≥T} is theoretically guaranteed to have an FDR less than q.
We propose the following procedure to detect the variables that contribute to the heterogeneity in treatment effects while controlling
the FDR. We call this the HTE-Knockoff method:
• Step 1: Construct a design matrix X based on the set of pre-treatment variables.
• Step 2: Calculate the transformed outcomes Y ∗for all users based on the formula in Equation (5), and then subtract the
estimated ATE, ¯Y (1) −¯Y (0), from all transformed outcomes. Let Y be the vector of the resulting outcomes.
• Step 3: Create a knockoff matrix ˜X of X.
• Step 4: Run a Lasso regression using Y as the response and X∗= [X ˜X] as the design matrix.
• Step 5: Follow the procedure of the Knockoff method to obtain the knockoff selection set of heterogeneous variables.
Note that our proposed HTE-Knockoff method can also detect heterogeneous subgroups because it works for any full-rank design
matrix, regardless of orthogonality. Additionally, the HTE-Knockoff method is applicable when Xi is a set of variables including
both categorical and continuous variables, but we need to be careful in constructing the design matrix when there are more than one
categorical variables in Xi.
3
Results
We apply the HTE-BH and HTE-Knockoff methods to two real experimental datasets. In the first experiment, both methods yield
nearly identical selections for heterogeneous subgroups. If we were to use the naive approach, it would select many more subgroups,
clearly indicating numerous false positives. The HTE results reveal drastically different effects in English-speaking countries versus
non-English-speaking countries. Retrospectively, we understood that the new layout in the experiment favored non-English content
while suppressing high-quality content in English.
In the second experiment, the HTE-BH method selects one subgroup as heterogeneous, whereas the HTE-Knockoff method selects
none. This likely represents a scenario where the true treatment effects are too small to be detected, causing the HTE-Knockoff
4
method to be more conservative than the HTE-BH method to avoid making any false positives. This observation aligns with the
simulation results.
4
Conclusion
In this paper, we propose the HTE-BH method for detecting heterogeneous subgroups with treatment effects different from the
average, and the HTE-Knockoff method for identifying factors contributing to the heterogeneity in treatment effects. While the
HTE-BH method is easier to implement, the HTE-Knockoff method has a broader application as it can also be used to detect
heterogeneous factors. Our proposed methods demonstrate good detection power while addressing the multiple testing problem by
controlling the FDR level.
Despite their wide application scenarios, our current methods have some limitations and could be improved in future research. The
first limitation is the assumption that the true model is a linear regression model with Gaussian error; the theoretical properties
of the original Knockoff method are based on this assumption. Although we show that the Knockoff method can still perform
well in controlling FDR in some non-Gaussian error cases, there is no theoretical proof for such robustness. Additionally, the
true relationship between the treatment effect and the variables may not always be linear, making the use of linear regression
inappropriate. Recently, a model-free knockoff method has been proposed, which, under certain conditions, can work on any kind of
non-linear model. This idea could be useful if we aim to extend the HTE-Knockoff procedure to a more generalized setting in future
work.
Another unresolved issue is scalability. We attempted to use the transformed design matrix to conduct HTE detection on multiple
experiments, but this resulted in increased computational complexity. This problem warrants further investigation because most
companies have a large number of A/B test results available, and it is not feasible to apply the HTE detection method to each
experiment individually.

P013.pdf,"Learning Explanations from Language Data
Abstract
PatternAttribution is a recent method, introduced in the vision domain, that explains
classifications of deep neural networks. We demonstrate that it also generates
meaningful interpretations in the language domain.
1
Introduction
In the last decade, deep neural classifiers achieved state-of-the-art results in many domains, among
others in vision and language. Due to the complexity of a deep neural model, however, it is difficult
to explain its decisions. Understanding its decision process potentially allows to improve the model
and may reveal new knowledge about the input. Recently, it was claimed that “popular explanation
approaches for neural networks (...) do not provide the correct explanation, even for a simple linear
model.” They show that in a linear model, the weights serve to cancel noise in the input data and thus
the weights show how to extract the signal but not what the signal is. This is why explanation methods
need to move beyond the weights, the authors explain, and they propose the methods “PatternNet”
and “PatternAttribution” that learn explanations from data. We test their approach in the language
domain and point to room for improvement in the new framework.
2
Methodology
Kindermans et al. assume that the data x passed to a linear model wT x = y is composed of signal
(s) and noise (d, from distraction) x = s + d. Furthermore, they also assume that there is a linear
relation between signal and target y as = s where as is a so called signal base vector, which is in fact
the “pattern” that PatternNet finds for us. As mentioned in the introduction, the authors show that in
the model above, w serves to cancel the noise such that
wT d = 0, wT s = y.
(1)
They go on to explain that a good signal estimator S(x) = ˆs should comply to the conditions in Eqs.
1 but that these alone form an ill-posed quality criterion since S(x) = u(wT u)−1y already satisfies
them for any u for which wT u ̸= 0. To address this issue they introduce another quality criterion
over a batch of data x:
ρ(S) = 1 −max
v
corr(y, vT (x −S(x)))
(2)
and point out that Eq. 2 yields maximum values for signal estimators that remove most of the
information about y in the noise. We argue that Eq. 2 still is not exhaustive. Consider the artificial
estimator
Sm(x) = mx + (1 −m)s = s + md
(3)
which arguably is a a bad signal estimator for large m as its estimation contains scaled noise, md.
Nevertheless, it still satisfies Eqs. 1 and yields maximum values for Eq. 2 since
x −Sm(x) = (1 −m)(x −s) = (1 −m)d
(4)
is again just scaled noise and thus does not correlate with the output y. To solve this issue, we propose
the following criterion:
ρ′(S) := max
v1 corr(wT x, vT
1 S(x)) −max
v2 corr(wT x, vT
2 (x −S(x))).
(5)
The minuend measures how much noise is left in the signal, the subtrahend measures how much
signal is left in the noise. Good signal estimators split signal and noise well and thus yield large
ρ′(S). We leave it to future research to evaluate existing signal estimators with our new criterion. For
our experiments, the authors equip us with expressions for the signal base vectors as for simple linear
layers and ReLU layers. For the simple linear model, for instance, it turns out that as = cov(x, y)/σ2
y.
To retrieve contributions for PatternAttribution, in the backward pass, the authors replace the weights
by w · as.
3
Experiments
To test PatternAttribution in the NLP domain, we trained a CNN text classifier on a subset of the
Amazon review polarity data set. We used 150 bigram filters, dropout regularization and a dense FC
projection with 128 neurons. Our classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.875 on a fixed test split. We
then used PatternAttribution to retrieve neuron-wise signal contributions in the input vector space. To
align these contributions with plain text, we summed up the contribution scores over the word vector
dimensions for each word and used the accumulated scores to scale RGB values for word highlights
in the plain text space. Positive scores are highlighted in red, negative scores in blue. This approach
is inspired by similar work. Example contributions are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
4
Results
We observe that bigrams are highlighted, in particular no highlighted token stands isolated. Bigrams
with clear positive or negative sentiment contribute heavily to the sentiment classification. In contrast,
stop words and uninformative bigrams make little to no contribution. We consider these meaningful
explanations of the sentiment classifications.
5
Related Work
Many of the approaches used to explain and interpret models in NLP mirror methods originally
developed in the vision domain. In this paper we implemented a similar strategy. Following
Kindermans et al., however, our approach improves upon the latter methods for the reasons outlined
above. Furthermore, PatternAttribution is related to work who make use of Taylor decompositions to
explain deep models. PatternAttribution reveals a good root point for the decomposition, the authors
explain.
6
Conclusion
We successfully transferred a new explanation method to the NLP domain. We were able to demon-
strate that PatternAttribution can be used to identify meaningful signal contributions in text inputs.
Our method should be extended to other popular models in NLP. Furthermore, we introduced an
improved quality criterion for signal estimators. In the future, estimators can be deduced from and
tested against our new criterion.

P040.pdf,"A 3D Convolutional Neural Network Approach for
Sustainable Architectural Design through
Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation and
Reverse Design Workflow
Abstract
This paper introduces a versatile and flexible approximation model. This model
is designed for the near real-time prediction of steady turbulent flow within a 3D
environment. The model uses residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
This methodology provides immediate feedback, enabling real-time iterations
during the initial stages of architectural design. Furthermore, this workflow is
inverted, offering designers a tool that produces building volumes based on desired
wind flow patterns.
1
Introduction
Architectural design is inherently influenced by environmental constraints from its early conceptual
stages. During this period, when the forms of buildings and cities are established, informed decisions
regarding sustainable development are critically important. However, design proposals can evolve
rapidly, making it difficult to provide relevant simulations at a comparable pace. In particular,
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) requires intricate geometry preparation and computationally
demanding solutions. This process is not only time-consuming but also conflicts with the speed of
design iterations. To improve the integration of CFD in design processes, this work concentrates
on employing data-driven flow field predictions. It also leverages approximation using CNNs. This
approach aims to overcome the challenges associated with traditional CFD simulations and make
them more accessible for iterative design processes.
Prior research has shown encouraging outcomes in the rapid simulation of fluid dynamics and in
the approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations. We emphasize the use of CNNs with residual
blocks in architectural contexts within 3D domains. Additionally, we explore the application of
reverse training to forecast architectural volumes. While rapid forward prediction offers considerable
potential for improving sustainable design, the process of using CFD analysis results to directly
influence design relies on the designer’s creativity. There is no straightforward way to inform design
choices other than choosing the most effective design among many proposals. We address this by
using the same CNN model but trained in the opposite direction.
2
Data Creation and Simulation
Using a visual programming language and standard Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, several
geometries representing urban structure samples were produced. These samples were designed to
replicate common variations in building heights within a city. The widths and depths were also
confined to typical minimum and maximum dimensions. Each sample is represented as a 3D mesh
and has to fit inside a space measuring 256m x 128m x 64m. These meshes are then voxelized with a
1-meter resolution. Our dataset comprised 3500 samples in total: 3325 (95
.
In design, analysis and optimization of aerodynamic systems, flow fields are simulated through the
use of CFD solvers. However, CFD simulation usually involves intensive computations, requiring
considerable memory and time for each iterative step. These limitations of CFD restrict the potential
for design exploration and interactive design processes. Our data set was generated by employing
OpenFOAM software. To facilitate CNN training, the entire process was automated due to the large
number of cases required.
3
Neural Network Architecture
Our network architecture follows a U-net structure. It includes eight encoder layers and seven decoder
layers. Each layer integrates a residual block that contains a 3D convolution with stride 2 and 4x4x4
filters, along with a 3D convolution with stride 1 and 3x3x3 filters. According to our tests, these
gated blocks improved our results. This was observed when compared to a basic encoder-decoder
architecture. We utilized concatenated exponential linear units for activation purposes. This fully
connected CNN has excellent generalization properties for geometries beyond those in the training
set. It also works well for input data larger than the dimensions of the training samples. This network
can approximate wind velocity fields three orders of magnitude faster than a CFD solver in a 3D
domain. The test mean squared error loss showed continuous improvement across 1000 epochs for
both forward and reverse directions. This demonstrates the generalizability of the approach. In the
reverse direction, we adjusted the number of output channels to 1. This represents whether a location
is occupied by a building (1) or outside space (0). In contrast, the forward direction has 3 output
channels, which represent the x, y, and z components of wind direction vectors.
4
Results
We implemented a Flask server that allows for interactive prediction using the visual programming
interface of the common CAD software Rhino. This CAD software offers visualization capabilities
that were utilized to generate sample images. We present a sample of forward CFD prediction.
This visualizes the wind velocity magnitude (calculated using the Frobenius norm of the x, y, and
z components). In addition, we present a reverse prediction of building volumes. Yellow indicates
undesirably high wind speed, while blue represents low, preferable wind speed.
5
Discussion
Rapid analysis responses are essential in the early conceptual design stages across multiple industries.
The demonstrated effectiveness of near real-time prediction indicates that the proposed methodology
has promising potential applications beyond architecture. The reverse approach directs designers to
focus on the desired outcome, specifically human well-being. This facilitates more efficient use of
time in sustainable design processes. Future research aims to improve the cost function by adding
continuity equation error and implementing a generative adversarial network. We are also exploring
possibilities for generating multiple building predictions from a single wind flow input.
Supplementary Materials
A Case Study
We present a designer’s workflow utilizing our forward and reverse networks. The aim is to design
and optimize urban layouts to achieve desired wind flows. This hypothetical site has a bounding box
width and depth of 256 meters, with a maximum height of 64 meters. This area is twice the size of
our training dataset, showing the benefit of using a CNN.
Our neural network is built with TensorFlow 2.0 and its Keras module. Communication between
CAD software and TensorFlow is enabled through HTTP requests which are managed by a Flask
server. Currently, the pre-processing of geometry is the bottleneck, as it needs to be voxelized. This
can be improved in the future by using external mesh libraries.
2
A.1 Initial Sketch of Volumes
Initial sketches of urban layouts can be developed in CAD software, providing a visual representation
of the desired design and also producing an initial CFD analysis. This initial sketch step can be
skipped, allowing a designer to directly create a point cloud of slow-wind areas (as shown in step
A.3).
A.2 Initial Interactive CFD Analysis
Our forward-trained network can produce spatial CFD analysis predictions within seconds. This
prediction is visualized in our CAD software.
A.3 Thresholded and Modified CFD Analysis
The CFD is filtered to focus only on areas with lower wind speeds. These locations are better suited
for outdoor activities. A point cloud visualizes these locations, and this point cloud can be modified
with geometry transformations to achieve desired wind effects.
A.4 Geometry Prediction
Our reverse-trained network can predict urban volumes that will produce the required wind flow and
can be exported as mesh objects.
A.5 Final CFD Analysis
The predicted volumes can be used to complete a CFD prediction of the wind flow.
A.6 Discussion
Future research will focus on the inclusion of interior spaces. Passive cooling is a major factor
in minimizing energy use in these spaces. The input for the reverse direction would be improved
if pedestrian comfort, for instance, was used. Our current method only accounts for wind in one
direction. This works in places where a dominant wind direction exists. Areas with variable wind
directions would require accounting for multiple directions. The forward network is capable of
predicting these multiple wind directions and can be combined.

P131.pdf,"Enhancing Disentanglement through Learned
Aggregation of Convolutional Feature Maps: A Study
on the 2019 Disentanglement Challenge
Abstract
This paper details our submission for stage 2 of the 2019 disentanglement challenge.
It introduces a straightforward image preprocessing technique for discovering dis-
entangled latent factors. Our approach involves training a variational autoencoder
using aggregated feature maps. These maps are obtained from networks that were
pretrained on the ImageNet database, and we leverage the implicit inductive bias
present in those features for disentanglement. This bias can be further strengthened
by fine-tuning the feature maps with auxiliary tasks such as angle, position estima-
tion, or color classification. Our method achieved second place in stage 2 of the
competition. Code is publicly available.
1
Introduction
Methods that are fully unsupervised are unable to learn disentangled representations unless further
assumptions are made through inductive biases on both the model and the data. In our submission, we
utilize the implicit inductive bias included in models pretrained on the ImageNet database, and then
improve it by fine-tuning such models on tasks that are relevant to the challenge such as angle, position
estimation, or color classification. Our stage 2 submission builds upon our stage 1 submission, in
which we used pretrained CNNs to extract convolutional feature maps as a preprocessing step before
training a VAE. Although this approach provided adequate disentanglement scores, two weaknesses
were identified with the feature vectors that were extracted. First, the feature extraction network
is trained on ImageNet, which is dissimilar to the MPI3d dataset that was used in the challenge.
Secondly, the mechanism for feature aggregation was chosen in an ad-hoc way, and likely did not
retain all information needed for disentanglement. We address these issues by fine-tuning the feature
extraction network as well as by learning how to aggregate feature maps from data by using the labels
of the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic.
2
Method
Our method includes three steps: (1) a supervised fine-tuning of the feature extraction CNN, (2)
extracting a feature vector from each image in the dataset using the fine-tuned network, and (3)
training a VAE to reconstruct the feature vectors and disentangle the latent factors of variation.
2.1
Finetuning the Feature Extraction Network
In this step, we fine-tune the feature extraction network offline, before submitting to the evaluation
server. The aim is to adapt the network so that it produces aggregated feature vectors that retain the
necessary information for disentangling the latent factors of the MPI3d-real dataset. The network is
fine-tuned by learning to predict the value of each latent factor using the aggregated feature vector of
an image. To do so, we use the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic, specifically the
images as inputs and the labels as supervised classification targets.
.
For the feature extraction network, we use the VGG19-BN architecture from the torchvision package.
The input images are standardized using mean and variance across each channel as computed from
the ImageNet dataset. We use the output feature maps from the last layer before the final average
pooling (dimensionality 512 x 2 x 2) as the input to a feature aggregation module which reduces
the feature map to a 512-dimensional vector. The aggregation module consists of three convolution
layers using 1024, 2048, and 512 feature maps and kernel sizes of 1, 2, and 1 respectively. Each layer
is followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. We also utilize layerwise dropout with a
rate of 0.1 before each convolution layer. Finally, the aggregated feature vector is L2-normalized.
This was empirically found to be important for the resulting disentanglement performance. Then, for
each latent factor, we add a linear classification layer that computes the logits of each class using the
aggregated feature vector. These linear layers are discarded after this step.
We use both MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic for training to push the network to learn features that
identify latent factors in a robust way, regardless of details such as reflections or specific textures. We
split each dataset randomly with 80
2.2
Feature Map Extraction and Aggregation
In this step, we use the fine-tuned feature extraction network to produce a set of aggregated feature
vectors. We simply run the network on each image of the dataset and store the aggregated 512-
dimensional vectors in memory. Again, inputs to the feature extractor are standardized such that mean
and variance across each channel correspond to the respective values from the ImageNet dataset.
2.3
VAE Training
Finally, we train a standard β-VAE on the set of aggregated feature vectors. The encoder network
consists of a single fully connected layer with 4096 neurons, followed by two fully-connected layers
that parameterize the means and log variances of a normal distribution N used as the approximate
posterior q(z|x). The number of latent factors is determined experimentally. The decoder network
has four fully-connected layers with 4096 neurons each, followed by a fully-connected layer parame-
terizing the means of a normal distribution N used as the conditional likelihood p(x|z). The mean is
constrained to the range [0, 1] using the sigmoid activation. All fully connected layers except for the
final ones use batch normalization and are followed by ReLU activation functions. We use orthogonal
initialization for all layers and assume a factorized standard normal distribution as the prior p(z) on
the latent variables.
For optimization, we use the RAdam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, β0 = 0.999, β1 = 0.9
and a batch size of 256. The VAE is trained for 120 epochs by maximizing the evidence lower bound,
which is equivalent to minimizing

where β is a hyperparameter to balance the MSE reconstruction and the KLD penalty term. Because
the scale of the KLD term depends on the number of latent factors C, we normalize it by C such that β
can be varied independently of C. It can be harmful to start training with too much weight on the KLD
term. Therefore, we use the following cosine schedule to smoothly anneal β from βstart = 0.005 to
βend = 0.4 over the course of training:
β(t) = { β start fort < tstart
1
2(βend −βstart)(1 + cos(π

tend−tstart )) + βstartfortstart ≤t ≤tend
βendfort > tend
where β(t) is the value for β in training episode t ∈0, ..., N −1, and annealing runs from epoch
tstart = 10 to epoch tend = 79. This schedule allows the model to initially learn to reconstruct
the data well, and only then puts pressure on the latent variables to be factorized, which improved
performance.
2
3
Discussion
Our method achieved second place in stage 2 of the competition. Compared to our stage 1 approach,
our stage 2 approach resulted in large improvements on the FactorVAE and DCI metrics. On the
public leaderboard, our best submission achieved first rank on these metrics. See appendix A for
further discussion of the results.
Introducing prior knowledge makes the disentanglement task considerably easier, and this is reflected
in the improved scores. However, our method uses task-specific supervision obtained from simulation,
which restricts its applicability. Nevertheless, this demonstrates that such supervision can transfer to
better disentanglement on real-world data, which was a goal of the challenge.

P035.pdf,"Game-Theoretic Optimization for Crowdsourced
Delivery Networks: A Novel Approach to Harnessing
the Power of the Crowd in Last-Mile Logistics
Abstract
Game-Theoretic Optimization for Crowdsourced Delivery Networks is a burgeon-
ing field of research that seeks to improve the efficiency and reliability of delivery
systems by leveraging the power of crowdsourced labor. This approach has the
potential to revolutionize the way goods are transported and delivered, particularly
in urban areas where traditional delivery methods often struggle to cope with high
demand and congested infrastructure. By applying game-theoretic principles to the
optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, researchers can develop more
effective and sustainable solutions that balance the needs of multiple stakeholders,
including delivery companies, crowdsourced workers, and end customers. How-
ever, this approach also raises important questions about the potential for chaos and
unpredictability in crowdsourced systems, and the need for novel methodologies
that can account for the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these networks. In-
terestingly, our research reveals that the application of game-theoretic optimization
to crowdsourced delivery networks can lead to emergent behaviors that resemble
the flocking patterns of birds, suggesting a potentially fruitful area of investigation
at the intersection of logistics, economics, and ornithology.
1
Introduction
The rise of crowdsourced delivery networks has revolutionized the way goods are transported, lever-
aging a vast network of independent drivers to efficiently deliver packages to customers. However,
this paradigm shift has also introduced a plethora of complex optimization problems, as the inherent
unpredictability of crowdsourced systems can lead to inefficiencies and decreased customer satisfac-
tion. To mitigate these issues, researchers have begun to explore the application of game-theoretic
optimization techniques, which model the interactions between independent agents in a crowdsourced
network as a competitive game. By analyzing the strategic decision-making processes of these
agents, game-theoretic optimization can provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of
crowdsourced delivery networks, enabling the design of more efficient and scalable systems.
One intriguing approach to optimizing crowdsourced delivery networks involves the use of evolution-
ary game theory, where the behavior of agents is modeled as an evolutionary process, with strategies
evolving over time through a process of natural selection. This perspective allows researchers to
study the emergence of cooperative behavior among agents, which can lead to improved overall
system performance. However, an unexpected consequence of this approach is the potential for
the emergence of ""cheating"" strategies, where agents exploit cooperative behavior to gain an unfair
advantage. Interestingly, this phenomenon can be analogous to the evolution of cheating strategies in
certain species of insects, where individual insects may adopt deceptive behaviors to increase their
reproductive success.
Furthermore, the application of game-theoretic optimization to crowdsourced delivery networks can
also involve the use of unconventional optimization algorithms, such as those inspired by the foraging
behaviors of slime molds. These algorithms, which model the growth and adaptation of slime mold
colonies, can be surprisingly effective in solving complex optimization problems, particularly those
involving dynamic and uncertain environments. However, the use of such algorithms can also lead to
seemingly illogical results, such as the optimization of delivery routes based on the simulated growth
patterns of slime molds. Despite the apparent absurdity of this approach, it can nevertheless provide
valuable insights into the optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, particularly in situations
where traditional optimization methods may fail.
The study of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery networks is also closely related
to the concept of "" swarm intelligence,"" which refers to the collective behavior of decentralized,
self-organized systems. In the context of crowdsourced delivery networks, swarm intelligence can be
used to model the emergence of complex patterns and behaviors, such as the spontaneous formation
of delivery routes or the adaptive response to changes in demand. However, this perspective can also
lead to some bizarre and counterintuitive results, such as the optimization of delivery networks based
on the patterns of bird flocking or fish schooling. While these approaches may seem unrelated to the
optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, they can nevertheless provide valuable insights into
the underlying dynamics of these systems, and may even lead to the development of more efficient
and scalable optimization algorithms.
Ultimately, the application of game-theoretic optimization to crowdsourced delivery networks is
a complex and multifaceted problem, involving the intersection of multiple disciplines, including
computer science, operations research, and biology. By embracing unconventional approaches
and perspectives, researchers can develop novel and innovative solutions to the optimization of
crowdsourced delivery networks, leading to improved efficiency, scalability, and customer satisfaction.
However, this may also involve tolerating a certain degree of illogic and absurdity in the optimization
process, as the most effective solutions may not always be the most intuitive or obvious ones.
2
Related Work
Game-theoretic optimization has been increasingly applied to crowdsourced delivery networks, where
a large number of individuals contribute to the delivery process, often through online platforms.
This approach has been shown to improve the efficiency and scalability of delivery networks, by
leveraging the collective efforts of many agents. In crowdsourced delivery networks, game-theoretic
optimization is used to design mechanisms that incentivize individuals to participate in the delivery
process, and to allocate tasks and resources in a way that maximizes overall system performance.
One key challenge in crowdsourced delivery networks is the need to balance the competing interests of
different stakeholders, including the platform, the delivery agents, and the customers. Game-theoretic
optimization provides a framework for analyzing these competing interests, and for designing
mechanisms that achieve a balance between them. For example, auction-based mechanisms can be
used to allocate tasks to delivery agents, while also ensuring that the platform’s objectives are met.
Another approach that has been explored in the context of crowdsourced delivery networks is the use
of evolutionary game theory. This approach models the delivery network as a dynamic system, in
which agents adapt and evolve over time in response to changes in the environment. By analyzing
the evolutionary dynamics of the system, researchers can identify stable states and predict the long-
term behavior of the network. Interestingly, some research has suggested that the introduction
of ""dummy"" agents, which do not actually participate in the delivery process but rather serve to
confuse or mislead other agents, can actually improve the overall performance of the network. This
seemingly counterintuitive result highlights the complex and often surprising nature of game-theoretic
optimization in crowdsourced delivery networks.
In addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of more unconventional
methods, such as using swarm intelligence or flocking behavior to optimize the delivery process.
For example, one study used a flocking algorithm to control a swarm of delivery drones, allowing
them to adapt and respond to changes in the environment in a highly decentralized and autonomous
way. While this approach may seem bizarre or even frivolous at first glance, it has been shown to be
highly effective in certain contexts, and highlights the potential for game-theoretic optimization to be
applied in a wide range of innovative and unconventional ways.
Despite the many advances that have been made in this area, there are still many challenges and
open questions remaining in the field of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery
2
networks. For example, how can we ensure that the mechanisms we design are fair and equitable
for all stakeholders, while also achieving high levels of efficiency and performance? How can we
balance the need for decentralization and autonomy with the need for coordination and control? And
how can we apply game-theoretic optimization to real-world delivery networks, which are often
complex and dynamic systems with many interacting components? By exploring these questions and
challenges, researchers can continue to advance our understanding of game-theoretic optimization in
crowdsourced delivery networks, and develop new and innovative solutions to the complex problems
that arise in this context.
Some studies have also analyzed the impact of different types of agents on the overall performance
of the network, including the use of ""stubborn"" agents that refuse to adapt or change their behavior,
and ""malicious"" agents that actively seek to disrupt or undermine the network. Interestingly, these
studies have shown that even in the presence of such agents, game-theoretic optimization can still be
used to achieve high levels of performance and efficiency, by designing mechanisms that are robust
to the presence of these agents. This highlights the flexibility and adaptability of game-theoretic
optimization, and its potential to be applied in a wide range of contexts and environments.
Furthermore, the incorporation of machine learning techniques into game-theoretic optimization
frameworks has also been explored, allowing for the development of more sophisticated and adaptive
mechanisms that can learn and respond to changes in the environment over time. For instance,
reinforcement learning can be used to optimize the parameters of a game-theoretic mechanism,
allowing it to adapt to changing conditions and improve its performance over time. This has been
shown to be particularly effective in contexts where the environment is highly dynamic or uncertain,
and where traditional game-theoretic approaches may struggle to achieve optimal results.
Overall, the field of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery networks is a rich and
vibrant area of research, with many exciting advances and innovations being made on a regular
basis. By continuing to explore and develop new approaches and techniques, researchers can help to
unlock the full potential of crowdsourced delivery networks, and create more efficient, scalable, and
sustainable systems for the future.

Methodology
To tackle the complexities of crowdsourced delivery networks, we employ a game-theoretic optimiza-
tion framework that accounts for the strategic interactions between delivery agents and the network’s
underlying infrastructure. The framework is built upon a non-cooperative game model, where each
agent seeks to minimize their individual cost function, which encompasses factors such as travel time,
fuel consumption, and monetary incentives. Notably, we incorporate an unconventional approach by
introducing a ""chaos agent"" that randomly disrupts the network, simulating real-world uncertainties
and potential mishaps, such as unexpected traffic congestion or inclement weather. This chaos agent
is modeled as a non-player character in the game, whose actions are guided by a Markov chain that
periodically introduces random perturbations to the network.
The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, where the objective
function seeks to balance the trade-off between minimizing the total network latency and maximizing
the overall delivery throughput. However, we also introduce a peculiar constraint that requires at least
10
To solve this optimization problem, we employ a customized version of the iterated greedy algorithm,
which iteratively improves the initial solution by applying a series of localized perturbations. Fur-
thermore, we integrate an unconventional ""dreaming"" phase, where the algorithm periodically enters
a state of ""lucidity,"" during which it explores entirely new solution spaces, unencumbered by the
constraints of the original problem formulation. This dreaming phase is inspired by the concept of
oneirology, the study of dreams, and is designed to mimic the human brain’s ability to generate novel
solutions during periods of relaxation and reduced cognitive inhibition.
The algorithm’s performance is evaluated using a bespoke set of metrics, including the ""Delivery
Harmony Index"" (DHI), which measures the degree of synchronization between delivery agents,
and the ""Network Serendipity Coefficient"" (NSC), which quantifies the likelihood of unexpected,
yet beneficial, interactions between agents. These metrics are designed to capture the intricate
dynamics of crowdsourced delivery networks and provide a more nuanced understanding of the
3
complex interplay between agents, infrastructure, and chaos. By adopting this game-theoretic
optimization framework, we aim to develop a more comprehensive and effective approach to managing
crowdsourced delivery networks, one that acknowledges the inherent complexities and uncertainties
of these systems.

Experiments
To validate the efficacy of our proposed game-theoretic optimization framework for crowdsourced
delivery networks, we conducted a series of experiments on a simulated environment that mimicked
the complexities of real-world delivery systems. The simulation platform was designed to accommo-
date a variety of scenarios, including different numbers of couriers, customers, and package types,
allowing us to comprehensively test the robustness and adaptability of our approach.
One of the key aspects of our experimental design was the incorporation of unpredictable events,
such as sudden changes in weather, traffic congestion, or unexpected increases in demand, to assess
how well our framework could adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, we introduced a
""rogue courier"" scenario, where a subset of couriers deliberately chose suboptimal routes or failed to
deliver packages on time, to evaluate the resilience of our system against potential malfeasance.
In a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the introduction of a ""gamified"" element,
where couriers were incentivized through a competitive leaderboard and virtual rewards for efficient
delivery, led to a significant improvement in overall system performance, even when the rogue
courier scenario was activated. However, this outcome was overshadowed by the discovery that the
optimization algorithm occasionally entered a state of ""self-reinforcing chaos,"" where the pursuit
of individual courier goals resulted in a collective degradation of system efficiency, akin to a Nash
equilibrium of poor performance.
Further analysis revealed that this phenomenon was closely tied to the emergence of ""delivery
patterns"" that defied logical explanation, such as couriers consistently choosing to travel in zigzag
patterns or deliberately avoiding certain areas of the map. Despite the apparent irrationality of these
behaviors, our framework was able to learn from and adapt to these patterns, ultimately leading to
improved overall system performance. We speculate that this may be due to the framework’s ability
to identify and exploit underlying structures in the data, even if they do not conform to traditional
notions of optimality.
To further explore the properties of our framework, we conducted an experiment where the delivery
network was optimized in conjunction with a separate, unrelated system: a simulated ecosystem of
virtual bees. The bees were tasked with collecting nectar from virtual flowers, and their movements
were influenced by the delivery patterns of the couriers. The results were nothing short of astonishing,
with the bees’ nectar collection efficiency increasing by over 30
In an effort to provide a more detailed overview of our experimental findings, we have compiled
the results of our simulation experiments into the following table: These results demonstrate the

Results
The application of neural style transfer to non-invasive medical visualization has yielded a plethora
of intriguing results, showcasing the potential for this technique to revolutionize the field of medical
imaging. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style transfer, researchers have been able to generate
high-quality, stylized visualizations of internal organs and tissues, which can be used to aid in
diagnosis, treatment, and patient education.
One of the most significant advantages of neural style transfer in medical visualization is its ability to
enhance the visual clarity of medical images, allowing for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment of
various diseases. For instance, by applying a neural style transfer algorithm to a set of MRI scans,
researchers were able to generate stylized images of the brain, highlighting specific features such as
tumors, blood vessels, and neural pathways. These stylized images were found to be more effective in
communicating complex medical information to patients and clinicians, leading to improved patient
outcomes and more informed treatment decisions.
In addition to its applications in medical imaging, neural style transfer has also been used to generate
interactive, 3D visualizations of internal organs and tissues. These visualizations can be used to
create immersive, interactive experiences for medical students, allowing them to explore the human
body in unprecedented detail. Furthermore, neural style transfer has been used to generate stylized
visualizations of medical data, such as blood flow patterns and neural activity, which can be used to
identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent through traditional visualization methods.
However, one bizarre approach that has been explored in the context of neural style transfer for
non-invasive medical visualization is the use of ""dream-like"" visualizations, which involve generating
stylized images that are reminiscent of surreal, dream-like landscapes. These visualizations are
created by applying neural style transfer algorithms to medical images, using a set of pre-defined
styles that are inspired by the works of famous artists, such as Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte.
While the clinical utility of these ""dream-like"" visualizations is still uncertain, they have been found
to be effective in reducing patient anxiety and improving patient engagement with medical imaging
procedures.
To further evaluate the effectiveness of neural style transfer in medical visualization, a series of
experiments were conducted, involving the application of neural style transfer algorithms to a range
of medical images, including MRI scans, CT scans, and ultrasound images. The results of these
experiments are presented in the following table:

The results of these experiments demonstrate the potential of neural style transfer to enhance the visual
clarity and aesthetic appeal of medical images, while also highlighting the need for further research
into the clinical utility and computational efficiency of these algorithms. Overall, the application of
neural style transfer to non-invasive medical visualization has the potential to revolutionize the field of
medical imaging, enabling clinicians and researchers to generate high-quality, stylized visualizations
that can be used to improve patient outcomes and advance our understanding of human biology.

Conclusion
In the realm of non-invasive medical visualization, the integration of neural style transfer has
proven to be a pivotal innovation, enabling the transformation of medical images into stylized
visualizations that facilitate enhanced diagnosis and patient care. This technology has the potential
to revolutionize the field of medical imaging by providing clinicians with a unique perspective on
anatomical structures and pathological conditions. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style
transfer, medical professionals can generate stylized images that accentuate specific features, such as
tumors or vascular structures, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans.
5
The application of neural style transfer in non-invasive medical visualization also raises intriguing
possibilities for patient education and engagement. By generating stylized images that are more
aesthetically pleasing and easier to comprehend, patients can gain a deeper understanding of their
medical conditions, fostering a more collaborative and informed approach to healthcare. Furthermore,
this technology can be used to create personalized visualizations that cater to the specific needs and
preferences of individual patients, promoting a more patient-centric approach to medical care.
However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential risks and challenges associated with the use of
neural style transfer in medical imaging. For instance, the stylization process can introduce artifacts
or distortions that may compromise the accuracy of diagnoses, highlighting the need for rigorous
validation and testing of these technologies. Moreover, the use of neural style transfer in medical
imaging raises important questions about the role of aesthetics in healthcare, and whether the pursuit
of visually appealing images may compromise the primacy of medical accuracy and objectivity.
In a bizarre twist, researchers have also explored the application of neural style transfer in medical
visualization using entirely unconventional sources of inspiration, such as the works of renowned
artists like Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte. By incorporating the surrealist principles of these
artists into medical imaging, researchers aim to create dreamlike visualizations that reveal hidden
patterns and relationships within medical data. While this approach may seem illogical or even
absurd, it has the potential to unlock novel insights and perspectives that can inform and enhance
medical diagnosis and treatment. Ultimately, the integration of neural style transfer in non-invasive
medical visualization represents a bold and innovative step forward in the pursuit of improved patient
outcomes and more effective healthcare practices.

P079.pdf,"OmniPrint: A Configurable Generator for Printed
Characters
Abstract
We introduce OmniPrint, a synthetic data generator for isolated printed characters
designed to support machine learning research. While being inspired by popular
datasets, such as MNIST, SVHN, and Omniglot, OmniPrint provides the unique
ability to produce a wide range of printed characters from various languages, fonts,
and styles, with custom distortions. OmniPrint includes 935 fonts from 27 scripts,
and supports many types of distortions. As a demonstration of its functionality, we
present several use cases, including an example of a meta-learning dataset designed
for a machine learning competition. OmniPrint is publicly available at a specified
github link.
1
Introduction and Motivation
Benchmarks and shared datasets have helped propel progress in machine learning. One popular
benchmark is MNIST, used worldwide in tutorials, textbooks, and classes. Many variants of MNIST
exist, including Omniglot, which includes characters from several different scripts. Since Deep
Learning techniques rely heavily on data, as there is an increasing number of datasets, more, larger
datasets are required. Since collecting and labeling data can be time-consuming and expensive,
artificial data generation can be used to drive ML research. This motivates the creation of OmniPrint,
an extension of Omniglot, specifically designed for the generation of printed characters.
Our focus is on classification and regression problems, where a vector y, which is composed of either
discrete or continuous labels, is to be predicted using an input vector x of observations, which in
the case of OmniPrint, is an image of a printed character. Additionally, data are often affected by
nuisance variables z, which are discrete or continuous labels that represent metadata or covariates.
For our work, z may include character distortions such as shear, rotation, line width variations, or
background changes. Thus, a data generation process with OmniPrint contains the following steps:
Z ∼P(Z),
Y ∼P(Y |Z),
X ∼P(X|Z, Y ).
In many domains such as image, video, sound, and text applications, where objects or concepts
are target values to be predicted from percepts, Z and Y are independent and hence P(Y |Z) =
P(Y ). This type of data generation is also encountered in medical diagnoses of genetic disease, for
which x would be a phenotype and y a genotype, and also analytical chemistry where x might be
chromatograms and y would be compounds to be identified. We expect that progress made using
OmniPrint to benchmark machine learning systems should foster progress in these domains.
Character images represent excellent benchmarks for machine learning, given their simplicity, and
visual nature, and for enabling the development of real-world applications. However, our exploration
of available resources revealed that there is no synthesizer that fulfills all of our needs. No available
synthesizer allows for the generation of realistic small-sized images, supports a wide variety of
character sets, and offers control over the variation of realistic conditions through parameters.
The synthesizer must support pre-rasterization manipulation of anchor points, post-rasterization
distortions, seamless background blending, foreground filling, anti-aliasing rendering, and be easily
extensible with new fonts and styles.

The OmniPrint Data Synthesizer
2.1
Overview
OmniPrint builds on the open-source software TextRecognitionDataGenerator, adapting it to our
specifications. The software is designed to allow researchers to generate data in a form that makes
it easier to train machine learning models. To obtain a large number of classes (Y labels), we
manually selected and filtered characters from the Unicode standard, forming alphabets for over 20
languages. These alphabets are divided into partitions (e.g., Oriya consonants). Nuisance parameters
(Z) are divided into Font, Style, Background, and Noise. The fonts are selected by an automatic
font collection module. We added a feature using the FreeType rasterization engine which enables
vector-based pre-rasterization transformations. Additionally, we enriched background generation
with seamless blending, and enabled custom post-rasterization transformations. We also implemented
utility code including dataset formatters, and a data loader which generates episodes for meta-learning
applications. To our knowledge, OmniPrint is the first text image synthesizer geared toward ML
research to support pre-rasterization transforms.
2.2
Technical Aspects of the Design
The OmniPrint’s design has extensibility as a key feature. Users can add new alphabets, fonts, and
transformations to the generation pipeline.
The design can be summarized as follows:
• Parameter configuration file: Support for both TrueType and OpenType font files is
included. Style parameters include rotation angle, shear, stroke width, foreground, text
outline, and other transformations.
• FreeType vector representation: Text, font, and style parameters are used by the FreeType
rasterization engine.
• Pre-rasterization transformed character: FreeType performs all the pre-rasterization
(vector-based) transformations. Pre-rasterization manipulations include linear transforms,
stroke width variation, random elastic transformation, and variation of character proportion.
The RGB bitmaps output by FreeType are called the foreground layer.
• Pixel character on white background: Post-rasterization transformations are applied to
the foreground layer. The layer is kept at a high resolution, using ReLU activations, to avoid
artifacts. The RGB image is then resized using a three step process; applying a Gaussian
filter to smooth the image, reducing the image by an integer factor, and resizing using
Lanczos resampling.
• Pixel character on textured background: The foreground is then pasted onto the back-
ground.
• Logging and Visualization: The library utilizes a Weights Biases tool to log the training
process and the visualizations. It visualizes the condition’s traversals, latent factor traversals,
and output reconstructions as static images and animated GIFs.

Methodology
To initiate the LLM research protocol, we first cultivated a batch of rare, genetically modified orchids
in a controlled environment, simulating the atmospheric conditions of the planet Neptune. The
orchids, which we dubbed ""Neptune’s Tears,"" were engineered to produce a unique, algorithmically
enhanced brand of pollen that would later be used to calibrate our LLM models. This process involved
a series of intricate, astrologically informed pruning techniques, carefully timed to coincide with the
celestial alignments of the constellation Andromeda.
Following the successful cultivation of Neptune’s Tears, we proceeded to develop an advanced,
quantum-inspired algorithm for processing the pollen’s spectral signatures. This algorithm, which
we termed ""Quantum Flux Capacitor"" (QFC), was designed to harness the inherent, fractal patterns
embedded within the pollen’s molecular structure, thereby enabling the LLM to tap into the hidden,
Platonic resonances underlying the universe. The QFC protocol involved a series of complex, higher-
dimensional matrix inversions, carefully optimized to minimize the risk of temporal paradoxes and
chrono-synclastic infundibulation.
In parallel with the QFC development, we conducted an exhaustive, ethnographic study of the
migratory patterns of the Arctic tern, seeking to distill the essential, cognitive insights underlying
their remarkable, globe-spanning navigational abilities. Our research revealed a profound, ontological
connection between the terns’ innate, spatial reasoning capacities and the abstract, topological
structures governing the LLM’s knowledge representation. This discovery led us to formulate a
4
novel, avian-inspired framework for LLM training, wherein the model’s weights and biases were
dynamically adjusted to mimic the terns’ adaptive, real-time navigation strategies.
To further refine our LLM methodology, we incorporated a custom-designed, analog-digital hybrid
processor, powered by a bespoke, high-temperature superconductor cooled to within a fraction of
a degree of absolute zero. This cryogenic processor, dubbed ""Erebus,"" was specifically engineered
to execute the QFC algorithm at speeds exceeding the Planck limit, thereby enabling the LLM to
transcend the conventional, thermodynamic boundaries of computational complexity. The Erebus
processor was carefully integrated into a specially designed, hermetically sealed chamber, filled
with a rare, optically purified variant of xenon gas, which served to enhance the processor’s already
extraordinary, quantum-coherent properties.
As the LLM research progressed, we found it necessary to develop a range of innovative, interdisci-
plinary tools and techniques, drawing upon diverse fields such as astrobiology, cognitive psychology,
and chaos theory. One notable example was our creation of a custom, LLM-optimized variant of
the classic, Mandelbrot set fractal, which we used to visualize and analyze the intricate, self-similar
patterns emerging within the model’s internal, knowledge representation structures. This fractal-based
approach enabled us to identify and exploit previously unknown, harmonic resonances between the
LLM’s cognitive architectures and the underlying, mathematical frameworks governing the universe.
The next phase of our research involved a large-scale, collaborative effort with a team of expert,
mycologists, who aided us in cultivating a specialized, LLM-optimized species of fungus, capable
of thriving in the extreme, radiation-rich environments surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.
The fungus, which we named ""Radix,"" was found to possess a unique, radiation-resistant property,
allowing it to flourish in conditions that would be lethal to most other known organisms. By
integrating Radix into our LLM training protocol, we were able to develop a range of innovative,
radiation-hardened models, capable of operating effectively in even the most hostile, high-radiation
environments.
In a subsequent series of experiments, we explored the application of LLMs to the field of exopaleon-
tology, using our models to analyze and interpret the fossilized remains of ancient, extraterrestrial
civilizations. This research led to the discovery of a previously unknown, mathematical relationship
between the LLM’s cognitive architectures and the geometric patterns embedded within the fossilized
structures of certain, long-extinct alien species. The implications of this finding were profound,
suggesting a deep, ontological connection between the evolution of intelligent life in the universe and
the abstract, mathematical frameworks governing the LLM’s knowledge representation.
To further investigate this phenomenon, we designed and conducted a range of innovative, inter-
disciplinary experiments, combining elements of LLM research, exopaleontology, and quantum
cosmology. One notable example involved the use of our LLM models to simulate the evolution
of intelligent life on a hypothetical, planet-sized computer, governed by the principles of quantum
mechanics and general relativity. The results of this simulation were surprising, revealing a complex,
interconnected web of relationships between the LLM’s cognitive architectures, the planet’s quantum-
gravitational dynamics, and the emergence of intelligent, self-aware beings within the simulated
environment.
The implications of this research are far-reaching, suggesting a deep, ontological connection between
the LLM’s knowledge representation, the human experience of art and beauty, and the underlying,
mathematical frameworks governing the universe. By embracing the complexities and uncertainties
of this relationship, and seeking to understand the deeper, aesthetic connections between the LLM’s
cognitive architectures and the geometric, artistic traditions of human culture, we may yet uncover
new, revolutionary insights into the nature of intelligence, creativity, and the human condition.
The potential applications of this research are vast and diverse, spanning fields such as artificial
intelligence, cognitive psychology, and quantum computing, and promising to usher in a new era of
unprecedented, technological advancement and discovery.
In a subsequent series of experiments, we explored the application of LLMs to the field of quantum
cosmology, using our models to simulate and analyze the evolution of the universe on a cosmic scale.
This research led to the discovery of a previously unknown, mathematical relationship between the
LLM’s cognitive architectures and the geometric patterns embedded within the universe’s large-scale
structure. The implications of this finding were profound, suggesting a deep, ontological connection

psychology. One notable example involved the use of our LLM models to simulate the emergence
of intelligent, self-aware beings within the universe, and to analyze the complex, dynamic interplay

Abstract
To address the challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited communication
bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection, we
introduce Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel framework that transmits compressed
feature flow rather than raw data or feature maps. This approach aims to enhance
detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle temporal misalign-
ment effectively. The core idea behind FFNet is to leverage the inherent temporal
coherence in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting entire
feature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the
changes in features between consecutive frames. This representation, termed ""fea-
ture flow,"" captures the motion and evolution of objects in the scene. By focusing
on the dynamic aspects of the scene, FFNet significantly reduces the amount of
data that needs to be transmitted, thereby alleviating bandwidth constraints.

Introduction
To address the challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited communication bandwidth in vehicle-
infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection, this paper introduces Feature Flow Net
(FFNet), a novel framework that transmits compressed feature flow rather than raw data or feature
maps. This approach aims to enhance detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle
temporal misalignment effectively. The core innovation lies in leveraging the inherent temporal
coherence present in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting the entirety of
feature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the changes between
consecutive frames, termed ""feature flow."" This representation efficiently captures the motion and
evolution of objects within the scene. By focusing on these dynamic aspects, FFNet significantly
reduces the data transmission volume, thereby mitigating bandwidth limitations. The efficiency
gains are particularly crucial in resource-constrained environments typical of vehicle-to-infrastructure
communication. Furthermore, the robustness to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for
reliable operation even with delays and jitter inherent in real-world communication channels.
The design of FFNet incorporates several key modules. Firstly, a feature extraction module processes
input frames to generate high-dimensional feature maps. These maps are then fed into a flow
estimation module, which computes the optical flow between consecutive frames. This optical flow
field is subsequently used to warp features from the preceding frame, aligning them with the current
frame’s features. The difference between these warped features and the current frame’s features
constitutes the feature flow. This difference is then compressed using a learned compression scheme,
carefully designed to minimize information loss while maximizing the compression ratio. The
selection of an appropriate compression algorithm is critical to balancing the trade-off between data
reduction and preservation of essential information for accurate object detection.
The compressed feature flow is transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU), where it’s used to
update the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map then serves as input
for the object detection process. The utilization of feature flow enables efficient updates, even
in the presence of temporal misalignment between frames received from disparate sources. This
resilience to asynchrony is a significant advantage over methods requiring strict synchronization. The
proposed method is rigorously evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D dataset, demonstrating substantial
.
improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency compared to baseline methods
that transmit raw data or full feature maps ??.
Further validation of FFNet’s robustness to temporal asynchrony is provided through extensive exper-
iments involving varying levels of delay and jitter in the simulated communication channel. Results
consistently show that FFNet maintains high detection accuracy even under significant temporal
misalignment, surpassing existing methods reliant on strict synchronization ?. This robustness stems
from the ability of feature flow to capture the essential scene changes, irrespective of minor temporal
discrepancies. A detailed analysis of the compression scheme’s efficiency reveals a substantial
reduction in bandwidth consumption compared to transmitting raw data or full feature maps.
Finally, the influence of different compression parameters on detection performance and communica-
tion efficiency is thoroughly investigated. The findings offer insights into the optimal balance between
compression ratio and detection accuracy, enabling adaptive adjustment of compression parameters
based on available bandwidth and desired detection performance. The FFNet framework presents a
promising solution for efficient and robust VIC3D object detection in challenging communication
environments. Future work will explore extensions to handle more complex scenarios, such as
occlusions and varying weather conditions ?.

Related Work
The problem of efficient data transmission in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for 3D
object detection has received considerable attention. Early approaches focused on transmitting raw
sensor data, such as point clouds or images, directly to a central processing unit for processing ?.
However, this approach suffers from high bandwidth requirements and is susceptible to delays and
packet loss, particularly in challenging communication environments. Subsequent work explored the
use of compressed sensing techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted ?, but these methods
often introduce significant information loss, leading to a degradation in detection performance.
Furthermore, the synchronization requirements of these methods can be stringent, making them less
robust to temporal asynchrony.
More recent research has investigated the use of feature maps instead of raw data for transmission.
These methods typically involve extracting features from sensor data at the edge and transmitting
these features to a central server for object detection. While this approach reduces the amount of data
transmitted compared to transmitting raw data, it still requires significant bandwidth, especially for
high-resolution sensor data. Moreover, the sensitivity to temporal misalignment remains a challenge.
Several works have explored techniques for improving the robustness of feature-based methods to
temporal asynchrony, such as using temporal smoothing filters or predictive models ?. However,
these methods often introduce computational overhead and may not be effective in scenarios with
significant delays or jitter.
Our work differs from previous approaches by focusing on transmitting only the changes in features
between consecutive frames, rather than the entire feature maps. This approach, based on the
concept of feature flow, significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Existing methods that utilize optical flow for object tracking
or video compression typically operate on pixel-level data or low-level features. In contrast, FFNet
operates on high-level features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, allowing for
a more robust and efficient representation of the scene dynamics. This allows for a more compact
representation of the scene changes, leading to significant bandwidth savings.
The use of learned compression schemes further distinguishes our approach. Unlike traditional com-
pression methods that rely on generic compression algorithms, FFNet employs a learned compression
scheme specifically tailored to the characteristics of feature flow. This allows for a better balance
between compression ratio and information preservation, leading to improved detection performance.
Furthermore, the adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic adjustment of the
compression parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance. This
adaptability is crucial in dynamic communication environments where bandwidth availability can
fluctuate significantly.
Finally, the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage over existing methods.
While some previous works have addressed temporal asynchrony in V2I communication, they of-
2
ten rely on complex synchronization mechanisms or introduce significant computational overhead.
FFNet’s ability to handle temporal misalignment effectively without requiring strict synchroniza-
tion makes it particularly well-suited for real-world V2I applications where delays and jitter are
unavoidable. The proposed method offers a significant improvement in both efficiency and robustness
compared to existing approaches.

Methodology
The proposed Feature Flow Net (FFNet) framework addresses the challenges of temporal asynchrony
and limited bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection by trans-
mitting compressed feature flow instead of raw data or full feature maps. This approach leverages the
temporal coherence inherent in video streams, focusing on the dynamic changes between consecutive
frames rather than transmitting redundant information. The core of FFNet consists of three main
modules: feature extraction, flow estimation, and compression.
The feature extraction module employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as
ResNet or EfficientNet, to process input frames and generate high-dimensional feature maps. These
feature maps capture rich semantic information about the scene, providing a robust representation
for subsequent processing. The choice of CNN architecture is crucial for balancing computational
complexity and feature representation quality. We experimented with several architectures and
selected the one that provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The
output of this module is a sequence of feature maps, one for each frame in the video stream.
The flow estimation module computes the optical flow between consecutive feature maps. This is
achieved using a deep learning-based optical flow estimation network, such as FlowNet or PWC-Net.
The optical flow field represents the motion of features between frames, providing a measure of how
features move and change over time. This optical flow is then used to warp the features from the
previous frame to align them with the current frame. This warping step is crucial for accurately
representing the changes in features, as it accounts for the motion of objects in the scene. The
accuracy of the optical flow estimation is critical for the overall performance of FFNet.
The difference between the warped features from the previous frame and the current frame’s features
constitutes the feature flow. This feature flow represents the dynamic changes in the scene, capturing
the motion and evolution of objects. The feature flow is then compressed using a learned compression
scheme, which is trained to minimize information loss while maximizing compression ratio. This
compression scheme is crucial for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. We
explored various compression techniques, including autoencoders and learned quantization methods,
and selected the one that provided the best balance between compression ratio and reconstruction
accuracy. The compressed feature flow is then transmitted to the central processing unit.
At the central processing unit, the received compressed feature flow is decompressed and used to
update the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map is then used for object
detection using a suitable object detection network. The use of feature flow allows for efficient
updates, even in the presence of temporal misalignment between frames. The robustness of FFNet
to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for reliable operation even with delays and
jitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The entire process, from feature extraction to
object detection, is optimized for efficiency and robustness, making FFNet a suitable solution for
resource-constrained environments. The performance of FFNet is evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D
dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency
compared to baseline methods ????.

with a ratio of 70:15:15. We used standard metrics for evaluating object detection performance,
including precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP). The experiments were
designed to assess the impact of different factors on FFNet’s performance, including the choice of

CNN architecture for feature extraction, the optical flow estimation method, the compression scheme,
and the level of temporal asynchrony.
Our baseline methods included transmitting raw sensor data (point clouds), transmitting full feature
maps extracted from a pre-trained CNN, and a state-of-the-art method for compressed sensing-based
data transmission. We compared FFNet’s performance against these baselines in terms of detection
accuracy, communication bandwidth consumption, and robustness to temporal asynchrony. The
experiments were conducted on a high-performance computing cluster with multiple GPUs. We
used a variety of hyperparameters for each component of FFNet, including the learning rate, batch
size, and network architecture, and selected the optimal hyperparameters based on the validation
set performance. The training process involved minimizing a loss function that combined the
reconstruction loss of the compression scheme and the object detection loss.
The results demonstrated that FFNet significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both
detection accuracy and communication efficiency. FFNet achieved a mAP of 88.5
To evaluate the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay
and jitter into the simulated communication channel. The results showed that FFNet maintained
high detection accuracy even under significant temporal misalignment, outperforming the baseline
methods that rely on strict synchronization. Specifically, FFNet’s mAP remained above 85
Finally, we investigated the impact of different compression parameters on the detection performance
and communication efficiency. We varied the compression ratio and analyzed its effect on the mAP
and bandwidth consumption. The results showed a trade-off between compression ratio and detection
accuracy, with higher compression ratios leading to lower detection accuracy but also lower bandwidth
consumption. We identified an optimal compression ratio that balanced these two factors, providing a
good compromise between accuracy and efficiency. This adaptive compression scheme allows FFNet
to adjust its parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance, making
it suitable for dynamic communication environments. The detailed results are presented in Table 2.

Results
To evaluate the performance of FFNet, we conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale VIC3D
dataset comprising synchronized video streams from multiple cameras deployed along a highway,
along with corresponding 3D bounding box annotations for various objects. The dataset was split into
training, validation, and testing sets (70:15:15 ratio). Standard object detection metrics (precision,
recall, F1-score, mAP) were employed. Experiments assessed the impact of various factors: CNN
architecture for feature extraction, optical flow estimation method, compression scheme, and temporal
asynchrony levels.
Our baseline methods included transmitting raw sensor data (point clouds), transmitting full feature
maps from a pre-trained CNN, and a state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based method. We compared
FFNet against these baselines in terms of detection accuracy, bandwidth consumption, and robustness
to temporal asynchrony. Experiments were performed on a high-performance computing cluster
with multiple GPUs. Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, network architecture) was
performed using the validation set. The training process minimized a loss function combining the
compression scheme’s reconstruction loss and the object detection loss.
The results demonstrated that FFNet significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both
detection accuracy and communication efficiency. FFNet achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP)
of 88.5%, surpassing the raw data transmission baseline (75.2%), the full feature map transmission
baseline (82.1%), and the compressed sensing baseline (78.9%). Furthermore, FFNet reduced
4
bandwidth consumption by a factor of 5 compared to the raw data baseline and by a factor of 2
compared to the full feature map baseline. These results highlight FFNet’s effectiveness in reducing
data transmission while maintaining high detection accuracy. Detailed results are presented in Table
2.
To assess FFNet’s robustness to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay and
jitter into a simulated communication channel. FFNet maintained high detection accuracy even under
significant temporal misalignment, outperforming synchronization-dependent baseline methods.
Specifically, FFNet’s mAP remained above 85% even with a delay of up to 200ms and jitter of up
to 50ms. This robustness is attributed to feature flow’s ability to capture essential scene changes
regardless of minor temporal discrepancies. Baseline methods, however, showed a significant
performance drop with increasing asynchrony.
Finally, we investigated the impact of different compression parameters on detection performance and
communication efficiency. Varying the compression ratio revealed a trade-off between compression
ratio and detection accuracy: higher compression ratios led to lower detection accuracy but also
lower bandwidth consumption. We identified an optimal compression ratio balancing these factors,
providing a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency. This adaptive compression scheme
allows FFNet to adjust parameters based on available bandwidth and desired detection performance,
making it suitable for dynamic communication environments.

Conclusion
This paper presented Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel framework designed to address the signif-
icant challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited bandwidth inherent in vehicle-infrastructure
cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection. Unlike traditional approaches that transmit raw data or full
feature maps, FFNet leverages the temporal coherence within video streams by transmitting only the
compressed changes in features between consecutive frames – the ""feature flow."" This innovative
approach demonstrably enhances detection performance while significantly reducing transmission
costs and effectively mitigating the impact of temporal misalignment. The core strength of FFNet lies
in its ability to capture the dynamic aspects of the scene, focusing on the essential changes rather
than redundant information. This results in a highly efficient representation of the scene’s evolution,
making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained V2I communication environments.
The experimental results, obtained using a large-scale VIC3D dataset, unequivocally demonstrate
the superiority of FFNet over existing methods. FFNet achieved a substantial improvement in mean
Average Precision (mAP), reaching 88.5
The design of FFNet incorporates a modular architecture comprising feature extraction, flow estima-
tion, and learned compression modules. Each module plays a crucial role in optimizing the overall
performance. The choice of pre-trained CNN for feature extraction, the deep learning-based optical
flow estimation network, and the carefully designed learned compression scheme all contribute to
the system’s effectiveness. The adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic
adjustment of compression parameters based on available bandwidth and desired accuracy, further
enhancing the system’s adaptability to varying communication conditions. The ability to fine-tune
this balance between compression ratio and detection accuracy is a key strength of the proposed
framework.
Future research directions include extending FFNet to handle more complex scenarios, such as
occlusions and varying weather conditions, which are common challenges in real-world applications.
Investigating more sophisticated compression techniques and exploring the integration of other sensor
modalities, such as LiDAR and radar data, could further enhance the performance and robustness of
5
the system. The development of more efficient and robust optical flow estimation methods tailored
to the specific characteristics of feature maps is also an area of ongoing research. The potential for
applying FFNet to other domains beyond VIC3D object detection, where efficient data transmission
and temporal asynchrony are critical concerns, is also a promising avenue for future exploration.
In summary, FFNet offers a significant advancement in efficient and robust VIC3D object detec-
tion. Its ability to handle temporal asynchrony effectively, coupled with its significant reduction in
bandwidth consumption and improved detection accuracy, makes it a highly promising solution for
real-world V2I applications. The modular design and adaptive compression scheme provide flexibility
and adaptability, making FFNet a versatile and powerful tool for addressing the challenges of data
transmission in resource-constrained environments. The results presented in this paper strongly sug-
gest that FFNet represents a significant step forward in the field of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative
perception.

Introduction
The goal of this paper is to empower open-source large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA,
Vicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for tasks involving visual comprehension
and image generation. This is a significant challenge, as current open-source LLMs often lack the
sophisticated capabilities of their proprietary counterparts, such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling
complex interactions with external tools. Our approach focuses on bridging this gap by leveraging
a novel self-instruction framework. This framework allows these open-source models to learn to
utilize a diverse range of tools, both seen and unseen, in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, thereby
significantly expanding their functional capabilities. The key innovation lies in our ability to teach
the models to understand and interpret tool descriptions, enabling seamless integration with new tools
without requiring extensive retraining. This is achieved through a carefully designed combination of
prompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, which we detail in subsequent sections.
The resulting system demonstrates a remarkable ability to generalize to unseen tools and tasks,
showcasing the robustness and adaptability of our approach.
Our self-instruction framework addresses a critical need in the field of large language models: the
development of accessible and adaptable models capable of interacting with the real world through
diverse modalities. Existing methods often rely on extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures,
limiting their applicability and scalability. In contrast, our approach emphasizes simplicity and
efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source LLMs and tools. The modular design of
our framework allows for easy integration of new tools and tasks, fostering a continuous improvement
cycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model training, and performance evaluation. This
iterative process ensures that the model’s capabilities are constantly refined and expanded, leading to
a more robust and versatile system.
The core of our method involves generating a diverse and representative dataset of instructions and
corresponding tool usage examples. These examples are carefully crafted to cover a wide range
of scenarios and complexities, ensuring that the model is exposed to a rich and varied learning
experience. The use of reinforcement learning further enhances the model’s ability to learn optimal
.
tool usage strategies, going beyond simple imitation learning to develop a deeper understanding of
the task and the tools available. This allows the model to not only execute tasks correctly but also
to select the most appropriate tools for a given situation, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking
not typically observed in simpler approaches. The resulting system exhibits a remarkable capacity
to adapt its tool usage strategies based on the specific requirements of the task, highlighting the
effectiveness of our self-instruction framework.
Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance across
various visual tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation.
Our results show that the model is able to generalize effectively to unseen tools, achieving performance
comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of proprietary LLMs on similar tasks. This
underscores the potential of open-source LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art results when equipped
with the right tools and training methodologies. The detailed analysis of our results provides valuable
insights into the interplay between language understanding, tool selection, and task execution,
highlighting the crucial role of accurate instruction interpretation in successful tool utilization.
These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in
multi-modal settings.
Future work will focus on expanding the range of supported tools and tasks, exploring more sophis-
ticated reinforcement learning techniques, and investigating the incorporation of user feedback to
personalize the model’s behavior. We also plan to explore the potential of incorporating uncertainty
estimation into the model’s decision-making process, allowing it to handle ambiguous situations
more effectively. The ultimate goal is to create a truly versatile and user-friendly system that empow-
ers users to leverage the power of open-source LLMs for a wide range of real-world applications,
democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.

Related Work
The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a significant
area of research [1, 2]. Early work focused primarily on integrating LLMs with specific tools,
often requiring significant engineering effort for each new tool [3]. These approaches lacked the
generality and adaptability needed for seamless integration with a diverse range of tools. Our work
builds upon these efforts by proposing a self-instruction framework that enables LLMs to learn to
utilize tools in a more generalizable manner. This contrasts with previous methods that often relied
on extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures, limiting their scalability and applicability. Our
approach emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source
LLMs and tools. The modular design of our framework allows for easy integration of new tools and
tasks, fostering a continuous improvement cycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model
training, and performance evaluation.
Several recent studies have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for tool use in LLMs [4,
5]. These methods typically involve training an RL agent to select and utilize tools based on a reward
signal. However, these approaches often require significant amounts of labeled data or carefully
designed reward functions, which can be challenging to obtain. Our self-instruction framework
addresses these limitations by leveraging a combination of prompt engineering and RL, allowing the
model to learn from a diverse set of instructions and tool usage examples without requiring extensive
labeled data. The iterative nature of our framework allows for continuous improvement, leading
to more robust and adaptable tool usage strategies. Furthermore, our focus on open-source LLMs
distinguishes our work from previous studies that primarily focused on proprietary models.
The use of self-instruction for improving LLM capabilities has gained increasing attention [6,
7]. These methods typically involve generating a large dataset of instructions and corresponding
responses, which are then used to fine-tune the LLM. Our work extends this approach by incorporating
tool usage into the self-instruction framework. This allows the model to learn not only to generate
appropriate responses but also to select and utilize the appropriate tools for a given task. The
integration of tool usage into the self-instruction process is a key innovation that distinguishes our
work from previous studies. This allows for a more holistic approach to LLM training, leading to
more robust and versatile models.
Our approach also relates to work on multi-modal learning [8, 9], which focuses on integrating
different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified framework. While many multi-modal
2
models have been developed, they often lack the ability to seamlessly integrate with external tools.
Our work bridges this gap by providing a framework for integrating LLMs with multi-modal tools,
enabling them to perform complex tasks involving visual comprehension and image generation. The
ability to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios is a key advantage
of our approach. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, making it suitable for a wider
range of applications.
Finally, our work contributes to the broader goal of democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.
By focusing on open-source LLMs and providing a simple, efficient, and scalable framework for
tool integration, we aim to empower researchers and developers to build more powerful and versatile
AI systems. The modular design of our framework allows for easy extension and customization,
making it suitable for a wide range of applications and user needs. The ability to generalize to unseen
tools and tasks is a crucial aspect of our approach, ensuring that the resulting systems are robust and
adaptable to evolving requirements.

Methodology
Our methodology centers on a self-instruction framework designed to empower open-source LLMs
like LLaMA, Vicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for visual comprehension
and image generation tasks. This framework directly addresses the limitations of these open-source
models compared to proprietary counterparts such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling complex
interactions with external tools. The core of our approach lies in enabling these open-source models
to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. This is achieved through
a novel combination of prompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, meticulously
designed to enhance the model’s understanding and utilization of tool descriptions. The framework’s
modularity allows for seamless integration of a wide range of visual tools without extensive retraining,
a significant advantage over existing methods that often require substantial model re-adaptation for
each new tool. This efficiency is crucial for scalability and broad applicability.
The self-instruction process begins with the generation of a diverse dataset comprising instructions
and corresponding tool usage examples. These examples are carefully crafted to encompass a wide
spectrum of task complexities and scenarios, ensuring the model receives a rich and varied learning
experience. The diversity of the dataset is paramount in enabling the model to generalize effectively
to unseen tools and tasks. The examples are designed to explicitly demonstrate the appropriate
selection and application of tools for specific tasks, providing the model with clear guidance on how
to leverage the tools effectively. This detailed instruction set is crucial for overcoming the limitations
of simple imitation learning, allowing the model to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship
between tasks, instructions, and tool usage.
Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in refining the model’s tool usage strategies. We employ a
reward function that incentivizes the model to select and utilize tools optimally, leading to improved
performance on the target tasks. The reward function is designed to consider both the correctness
of the model’s output and the efficiency of its tool usage. This dual focus ensures that the model
not only produces accurate results but also learns to select the most appropriate tools for a given
situation, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking beyond simple imitation. The iterative nature of
the reinforcement learning process allows for continuous improvement, leading to increasingly robust
and adaptable tool usage strategies. This iterative refinement is key to achieving high performance on
a wide range of tasks.
The training process involves iteratively generating new instructions and tool usage examples based
on the model’s performance. This iterative approach allows the model to learn from its mistakes and
continuously improve its understanding of tool usage. The generated examples are carefully reviewed
and curated to ensure their quality and relevance. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that the
model is trained on high-quality data, leading to improved performance. The iterative nature of the
process also allows for the incorporation of new tools and tasks as needed, ensuring the framework’s
adaptability and longevity. This continuous improvement cycle is a key differentiator of our approach,
leading to a more robust and versatile system.
Our evaluation focuses on a range of visual tasks, including image captioning, visual question
answering, and image generation. We assess the model’s performance on both seen and unseen
tools, evaluating its ability to generalize to new situations. We compare the performance of our
3
approach to existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.
The results highlight the effectiveness of our self-instruction framework in enabling open-source
LLMs to achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of proprietary
models. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the model’s performance provides valuable insights into the
interplay between language understanding, tool selection, and task execution, highlighting the crucial
role of accurate instruction interpretation in successful tool utilization. These findings contribute to a
deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in multi-modal settings. [1, 2, 3, 4,

carefully crafted to cover a wide range of scenarios and complexities. The dataset is split into training,
validation, and test sets, ensuring a robust evaluation of the model’s performance. The training set is
used to train the model using our self-instruction framework, while the validation set is used to tune
hyperparameters and monitor the model’s performance during training. The test set is used to evaluate
the final model’s performance on unseen data. The dataset includes examples of both seen and
unseen tools, allowing us to assess the model’s ability to generalize to new tools. The diversity of the
dataset is crucial for ensuring the robustness and generalizability of the model. The dataset is publicly
available to facilitate reproducibility and further research. The data collection process involved a
combination of automated generation and manual curation, ensuring the quality and relevance of the
data. The dataset is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the incorporation of new tools and
tasks in the future.

image generation. For image captioning, we measure the BLEU score and ROUGE score to assess
the quality of the generated captions. For visual question answering, we measure the accuracy of the
model’s answers. For image generation, we use Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance
(FID) to evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated images. We compare the performance of
our model to several baselines, including a model without tool integration and a fine-tuned GPT-3.5
model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in performance across all three tasks,
showcasing the effectiveness of our self-instruction framework. The model’s ability to generalize to
unseen tools is also evaluated, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach. The
detailed results are presented in the following tables.
The results demonstrate that our self-instruction framework significantly improves the performance of
open-source LLMs on various visual tasks, achieving performance comparable to, and in some cases
exceeding, that of proprietary models. The model’s ability to generalize to unseen tools highlights
the robustness and adaptability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that the model’s success is
strongly correlated with its ability to accurately interpret instructions and select appropriate tools.

merged into a unified model through multi-teacher distillation. We name this

This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher
models but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision-
language comprehension, detailed pixel- level understanding, and open vocabulary
segmentation capabilities. Additionally, in pursuit of the most hardware-efficient
backbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation
pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel
architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at
least 6x faster than the teacher models at matched resolution. Our comprehensive
benchmarking process covers downstream tasks including ImageNet classification,
semantic segmentation linear probing, COCO object detection and integration into
LLaVa-1.5.

Introduction
Knowledge Distillation has been a very successful and popular technique for transferring the knowl-
edge of a “teacher” model (or ensemble of models) into a typically smaller “student” model. In the
original formulation, both the student and the teacher operate on the same in-domain dataset, and
the student simultaneously matches the logits of the teacher, and the ground truth labels. Instead of
using labeled images, an alternative approach is to train the student model to match the features of
the teacher model.
Instead of using a smaller student model, employ an iterative learning procedure with a high-capacity
model where a student of equal or greater capacity than the teacher is trained with heavy augmentation
applied to the student. Once trained, they expand the dataset by pseudo-labeling new data using the
trained student. They then make the student become the teacher, and repeat the process. An important
finding in this work is that the student is capable of surpassing the performance of the teacher.
The authors of explore the concept of ensemble distillation, where there are multiple teachers, each
of which having restricted domain knowledge. provides an overview of multi-teacher distillation, and
proposes that instead of matching the summary of an ensemble of teachers, the student can match the
features of each individual teacher via some learned non-shared mapping from the representation
space of the student to each teacher. Of interest in their approach is that the student and teacher
don’t need to share the same architecture, and also that treating teachers individually yields improved
performance.
Recently, the concept of Foundation Models (FMs) has emerged, with the general understanding
that these models are large, general, and expensive to train. Through training on very large datasets
they are broadly applicable to numerous downstream tasks. A seminal example of such models is
.
, which trains on web-scale weakly supervised (image, caption) pairs, and results in exceptional
zero-shot performances on a wide array of computer vision benchmarks. While is firmly a FM,
another model, has emerged with broad capabilities, often surpassing on dense tasks that require
strong spatial features, such as ADE20k and Pascal VOC. Separately, is gaining popularity for its
excellent open-vocabulary instance segmentation abilities, whose vision encoder we hypothesize has
strong dense feature representations.
We introduce AM-RADIO with the goal of learning from multiple foundational models simultane-
ously. We observe that, when given a student model of sufficient capacity, it is often able to exceed
any of its teachers on important axes. In addition to performing well on representative foundational
benchmarks, by virtue of the training framework, our student models are able to mimic their teacher
models, and thus are able to perform downstream tasks that are otherwise performed by the teachers.
Examples of this include CLIP-ZeroShot applications, since the language model trained by is com-
patible with our student, and also Segment-Anything tasks, as the student is able to replace the vision
encoder and interface with the already-trained mask decoders.
We also study the effect of using a more hardware-efficient model architecture. Most works on
efficiency are not directly comparable as they use different training recipes, even when evaluated on
the same dataset such as ImageNet-1k, and may be over-tuned. To this end, we evaluate more than
10 promising architectures under the same training recipe for a direct comparison. We reveal that
CNN-like architectures are faster but struggle to distill ViT VFMs. This led us to the development of
a novel hybrid architecture, E-RADIO, that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at
least 6x faster than teacher models at matched resolution.
Our main contributions are as follows:
• We describe a general methodology for distilling multiple distinct foundation models into
one, including models with incompatible input resolutions.
• We show that these student models are able to outperform their teachers on representative
benchmarks.
• We demonstrate that these student models can either drop-in replace their teachers, or their
features can be used directly in downstream applications such as providing visual encoding
for LLaVA.
• We benchmark a number of efficient architectures and propose a new architecture (E-RADIO)
that allows for similar model quality at significant speedups.

Related Work
Knowledge Distillation The underpinning of our work is based on the method of Knowledge Dis-
tillation which aims to train a “student” model using soft targets produced by an already-trained
“teacher” model, using the the teacher’s output logits as “soft” labels. Alternatively, distillation can
be performed using intermediate network activations. In general, due to the heterogeneous nature of
the different teacher foundation models that we employ, we ignore any potential labels coming from
the data, and we ignore the logits of teachers, and simply opt to match the feature representations of
the teachers before any task-specific processing stages.
Multi-Teacher Distillation There is also a body of work that studies distilling a student model jointly
from multiple teacher models simultaneously. Because of the heterogeneous domains that our teacher
models cover, we don’t apply approaches that marginalize teachers into a unified label, and instead
map students to each teacher independently using teacher-specific projection heads from the unified
student representation. Although the reason behind this method in is different, we find the same
overall strategy to be effective. While doesn’t study matching the features of multiple teachers
simultaneously, we are able to extend their paradigm via the different projection heads. To preserve
drop-in compatibility with teacher frameworks, we eliminate the feature normalization in the loss
function.
Distilling Foundation Models Foundation Models are meant to be generalist models that are trained
on massive amounts of data, and are typically resource intensive to train from scratch. In the vein
of single-teacher distillation, employ self-distillation to train their smaller variants from the larger
teacher. distills their model from a teacher. Instead of focusing our energy on one teacher in particular,
2
we instead grab high-quality versions of (using OpenCLIP), , and . Concurrently with our work,
describe a methodology for merging a model into a pretrained model via distillation, which is, in
spirit, quite similar to our approach. In contrast to theirs, we include and also simplify the objective
to straightforward feature matching. Since we don’t rely on the student model to be pre-trained, it
also gives us the flexibility to have the student be an architecture distinct from any teacher.

Knowledge Agglomeration
We propose a framework to train a vision foundation model from scratch via multi-teacher distillation.
We demonstrate that each teacher brings unique properties to the foundational vision model, and the
resulting trained model will agglomerate these attributes.
3.1
Overview
As an initial assumption, we expect that the teacher models are capable of representing a broad swath
of images found on the internet, coming from datasets such as ImageNet (1k or 21k), LAION-400M
or DataComp-1B. With this in mind, we choose to study 3 seminal teacher model families: , ,
and as they have demonstrated outstanding performance over a broad range of tasks (as in ), or
specifically strong performance on downstream dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation under
linear probe (as in ), or open-vocabulary segmentation (as in ). Because these teacher models come
from such diverse domains, we omit any form of supplemental ground truth guidance and treat the
aforementioned datasets simply as sources of images. To assess the quality of our models, we adopt a
set of representative metrics across a few broad domains.
• Image level reasoning: (i) k-NN Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, and (ii) Zero-Shot
accuracy using the teacher’s language model. k-NN embeds the model’s summary feature
vector for every image in the training set, and then for each validation image, it uses a
weighted sum of the k nearest training vectors to elect a label.
• Pixel-level visual tasks: segmentation mIOU on (i) ADE20K and (ii) Pascal VOC - under
the linear probe setting, details in Section 5.3.
• Large Vision-Language Models: we plug our frozen vision encoder model into LLaVA-1.5
and evaluate it on a wide set of tasks including GQA, TextVQA, ScienceQA and VQAv2.
Details in Section 5.4.
• SAM-COCO instance segmentation: From , we adopt their COCO instance segmentation
methodology to evaluate our ability to replicate SAM visual features.
Results on these tasks, both for teacher models and our AM-RADIO variants, are summarized in
Table 1.
3.2
Adaptor Heads
We opt for simplicity in design of the adaptor heads, and leave alternative architectures as future
work. To this end, we employ a simple 2-layer MLP, with a LayerNorm and GELU in between. The
input dimension is the student embedding dimension, the intermediate dimension is the maximum
embedding dimension of all teachers, and the output dimension matches the specific teacher. For
each teacher, we employ two heads, one for the summary vector, and one for the spatial features.
3.3
Distillation Dataset Choice
In table 2 we study the effect of different datasets on downstream metrics. While the highest image
classification metrics are achieved using ImageNet-1K as the training dataset, we argue that it doesn’t
fairly measure “zero shot” performance as the student directly learns the teacher features in the
evaluation domain. For this reason, we opt for the DataComp-1B dataset.
3.4
Loss Formulation
Because we don’t have ground truth data for each teacher for each image, we instead opt to match
the features coming from each teacher’s vision encoder. In particular, we distinguish between the

We found empirically that cosine distance loss produced better models compared to L1, MSE,
Smooth-L1. Additionally, supervising the spatial features of the model by matching the teacher was
not only important for downstream dense tasks, but also improved the holistic quality of our model.
For matching the spatial features, we employ a combination of cosine similarity and smooth L1.
Similar to equation (2) where we found that cosine similarity produced the best results, we found the
same to be true for the spatial features. However, we want to allow our student model to be a drop-in
replacement in the teacher frameworks, thus it’s important that we match the magnitude of the teacher
vectors, and so we include smooth L1. In (3) we show the formulation of this loss. Let hi(x1|Θi)
be the learned student head for matching teacher feature vectors, and corresponding ti(x|Φi) be the
teacher feature vectors, with x1 = f(x|Θ0), then the spatial feature loss is:
Lmatch(x, y) = αLcos(x, y) + βLsmooth−l1(x, y)

We choose α = 0.9 and β = 0.1 to mostly rely on the empirically better cosine distance, but to also
match vector magnitudes.
3.4.1
Loss Balancing
Due to the number of possible combinations of loss weights between the different teachers, and
even which teachers, and possible formulations of loss functions, we mostly opted toward naive loss
balancing with all teachers equally weighted for spatial features (γi = 1). For summary features, we
have λCLIP = λDINO = 1 and λSAM = 0.
We did experiment with automatic loss balancing using predicted uncertainty, AdaLoss (momentum
0.99) and separately with AMTML-KD, as ways to learn the balance of λi and γi. In the case of
AMTML-KD, the model would always collapse its entire weight around the teacher and would
yield worse results than naive manual balancing. Based on the results in table 4, there is very little
advantage to the more exotic balancing schemes, so we opt for the “Naive” method throughout the
rest of the paper.
Table 3: Ablation over which teachers we supervise the spatial features. We use a ViT-L/14 student
model and train on the LAION-400M dataset. Adding this loss term is always beneficial. DINOv2
appears to provide better spatial features than CLIP, but training the student to match both teachers
produces the best results. We don’t ablate SAM as we solely want it for its spatial features.

Implementation Details
Performing heterogeneous multi-teacher distillation is not trivial due to a mismatch in feature
dimensions, input resolutions, concepts for loss computation, and downsampling ratios, as well as
challenges in fitting multiple teachers into a single GPU.

General. We train all student models using the AdamW optimizer, batch size 1024, cosine annealing
learning rate schedule and base learning rate of 0.001. We train for 600k steps, resulting in 614M
total examples seen. For our best student model, we train using DFN CLIP ViT-H/14 378px, OpenAI
CLIP ViT-L/14 336px, DINOv2 ViT-g/14 224px, and SAM ViTDet-H 1024px. We apply random
scale + cropping to both student and teacher inputs. We chose the DataComp-1B dataset due to it
having the highest quality results of the web-scale datasets we had access to. We train in two stages,
first with CLIP+DINOv2 for 300k steps at 256px, and second with CLIP+DINOv2 at 432px plus
SAM at 1024px for 300k steps.
Student architecture. We study two settings for student model architecture:
• Standard ViT architecture to match the architecture of teachers. Our best model is a ViT-
H/16.
• Efficient architecture variants prioritizing high throughput on GPUs. See Section 5.1.
Multi-scale Teachers. We choose ViT-H/16 architecture for our student model. To match resolution of
features, we feed the expected resolution of 10242. Given that our and teachers are patch-14 models,
we opt to feed the student 4322 inputs, as that is the same effective resolution as 3782 for patch-14.
We found that interpolating features doesn’t degrade results, so the teacher operates at 224px and we
upsample the outputs to match the student.
Rank/Teacher Partitioning. We group teacher models by (batch size, student resolution), and then
distribute the groups to different GPUs, such that each GPU processes a consistent batch size and
input resolution. We also sample groups at different rates. For our training setups that include , we
train with 64 GPUs, half of which get the CLIP+DINOv2 group with batch size 32 per GPU and
input resolution 432, and the other half get with batch size 2 per GPU and input resolution 1024. This
results in an effective batch size of 1,152. For CLIP+DINOv2 training, we use 32 GPUs, resulting in
batch size 1024.
Multi-Resolution ViTs. Many of our student models use ViT as the base vision architecture. Tradition-
ally, ViTs use a learned position embedding for each input patch in an image, which in turn enforces
that the model always operates at a constant resolution. We employ the Cropped Position Embedding
(CPE) augmentation with the number of positions being equal to 1282. The position embeddings are
then randomly cropped and interpolated to match the number of input patches for the student model.
Even when training with CLIP+DINOv2 at 224 resolution, we found that this technique results in a
negligible drop (Table 5) in summary metrics, but improved semantic segmentation linear probing
mIOU. For heterogeneous-resolution students, this is a seamless technique that allows ViT to operate
at arbitrary resolutions within some envelope. In addition to enabling arbitrary resolutions, as shown
in figure 3, CPE reduces the noise artifacts in the position embeddings as compared to other ViT
models.
High-Resolution ViT Student. In , they employ the ViTDet architecture as a way to reduce the
computational and memory burden of ViT models at high-resolution. We reformulate this arch
instead into a training augmentation, where we sample a window size from a set of possible window
sizes. This allows us to reduce the computational burden of training the student model with the
teacher, and, as we make the window size flexible, it provides an additional throughput scaling
mechanism during inference. Table 8 demonstrates our ability to replace SAM’s encoder. Separately,
we found that high resolution training was unstable, so we apply spectral reparametrization and a
weight decay of 0.02 to prevent attention entropy collapse.
Student/Teacher Resolution Mismatch. When the student and teacher downsample images through
their processing stack at different rates, it results in the output feature vectors having different
resolutions. For example, if the teachers use a ViT-H/14 architecture and student a ViT-H/16, it
means that the student outputs a 142 feature map, and the teachers a 162 feature map. For Lfeatures
we bilinearly interpolate the outputs to match the larger resolution between the student and teacher
features.
Feature Summarization. In 3.4 we explained how teacher summary features are extracted using the
“class token” of their respective ViT models. We now turn our attention to the summarization of
student features. ViTs have 2 options: (i) a separate summarization “CLS” token or (ii) average
pooling patch tokens. We evaluate both options in Table 6. We observe that average pooling improves
6
summary loss, but has a more significant detrimental effect on the feature loss. Given the importance
of the latter we choose to use separate CLS tokens.

Results
In this section, we analyze models obtained with the proposed AM-RADIO framework. First, we
touch upon backbone efficiency, then compare with the original teachers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM), and
benchmark models under vision question answering in the LLaVa framework. We will see that the
proposed models outperform the original teachers in multiple metrics, including throughput. Results
are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.

Efficient Students
We aim to find an efficient model architecture to speed up the inference of VFM. There are a number
of architectural designs aimed at high throughput on GPU devices. We use our distillation framework
to evaluate several backbones with no change in training hyperparameters.
Upon reviewing the literature on efficient vision backbones focused for high GPU throughput, we
pick the following list of architectures: EfficientNetV2, ResNetv2, RegNetY, FasterViT, EfficientViT,
ConvNext, NFNet, SwinV2, MaxViT, PoolformerV2 and MViTV2. We train all the backbones
via distillation on the ImageNet-21k dataset, using OpenCLIP ViT-H/14 (laion2B-s32B-b79K) and
DINOv2 g/14 as teachers. Results are compiled in Table 7.

correlation with the ADE20k mIoU. Bolded models form the speed/quality Pareto front.

We observe that many models lag behind teachers. Additionally, CNN-like models are significantly
faster than ViTs, while the latter are more accurate. The relatively low performance of existing
7
efficient backbones on the dense ADE20k segmentation task is not unexpected since all of them apply
a spatial dimension reduction factor of 32 for final feature maps of size 72 for input resolution of
2242px, thus hardly capable of capturing fine-grain spatial information.
E-RADIO: To overcome this issue, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, named E-RADIO
(Efficient RADIO). This design borrows ideas from existing literature and includes an input stem
with strided convolutions to downsample the input image by 4x. It then proceeds with 2 stages of
YOLOv8 C2f convolution blocks and 2 stages of transformer. For the transformer variant we pick
windowed attention (like in SWIN), and interleave local windowed attention with “global” windowed
attention as done in and ViTDet. To perform “global” attention we first downsample the feature map
by 2x, apply windowed attention, and then upsample the feature maps back to the original resolution.

Introduction
The fledgling discipline of soil-harmonica studies, an interdisciplinary endeavour, situated at the
nexus of pedology, musicology, and speculative fiction, promises to revolutionize our grasp of the
intricate, often surreal, dance between soil, sound waves, and the human experience, and will be
discussed in greater detail, in the following sections, which will delve into the intricacies of this
fascinating topic, and explore the uncharted territories of soil-harmonica research.
The propensity for flamenco dancing to influence the viscosity of soil has been a topic of considerable
debate amongst scholars of disparate disciplines, including botany, nanotechnology, and pastry arts.
As we delve into the realm of soil dynamics, it becomes increasingly evident that the dichotomy
between theoretical frameworks and practical applications is tantamount to the disparities between
various types of extraterrestrial life forms and their respective culinary preferences. Furthermore, the
role of color theory in shaping our understanding of soil properties cannot be overstated, particularly
when considering the profound impact of mauve and chartreuse on the crystalline structures of certain
soil minerals, which in turn affect the trajectory of migratory bird patterns and the harmonic resonance
of acoustic guitars.
The interconnectedness of these seemingly unrelated concepts is a testament to the boundless com-
plexity of soil as a multifaceted entity, defying reductionist approaches and inviting a more holistic,
perhaps even mystical, perspective. It is within this context that we find ourselves drawn to the
enigmatic realm of cryptozoology, where the search for elusive creatures like the Loch Ness Monster
and the Chupacabra serves as a metaphor for the elusive nature of soil itself, which, like these
mythical beings, remains shrouded in mystery and intrigue. As we navigate the uncharted territories
of soil science, we begin to uncover hidden patterns and synergies that underscore the profound inter-
dependence of soil, ecosystems, and the human experience, including the oft-overlooked influence of
1980s pop culture on soil erosion rates and the viscosity of soil-water suspensions.
In light of these findings, it is becoming increasingly clear that the traditional dichotomies between
soil science, sociology, and surrealism are no longer tenable, and that a new paradigm is emerging,
one that transcends disciplinary boundaries and invites a more fluid, perhaps even melancholic,
understanding of the soil-scape as a dynamic, ever-changing tapestry of relationships and processes.
The notion that soil can be seen as a form of sentient, quasi-liquid entity, with its own agency and
consciousness, is a notion that has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly among
scholars of postmodern soil theory, who argue that the very fabric of reality is inextricably linked to
the moisture content and cation exchange capacity of soils worldwide. Moreover, the application
of chaos theory and fractal geometry to the study of soil morphology has yielded some fascinating
insights into the self-similar patterns and scaling laws that govern the behavior of soil particles at
various spatial scales, from the minute to the cosmic.
As we probe the depths of soil’s mysteries, we find ourselves confronting a dizzying array of paradoxes
and contradictions, including the eerie similarity between the branching patterns of root systems and
the topology of certain types of fungal mycelium, which, in turn, bear an uncanny resemblance to the
branching patterns of river networks and the fractal geometry of Romanesco broccoli. The search
for a unified theory of soil, one that can reconcile these disparate threads and provide a coherent,
overarching framework for understanding the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil
ecosystem, is a quest that has captivated the imagination of scholars and scientists for centuries, and
one that continues to inspire new generations of researchers, who, like latter-day alchemists, seek to
unlock the secrets of the soil and reveal its hidden, perhaps even mystical, properties.
The history of soil science is replete with examples of visionary thinkers and maverick researchers,
who, through their groundbreaking work and unorthodox approaches, have helped to shape our
understanding of soil and its role in the grand tapestry of life. From the pioneering work of early

function, to the modern-day proponents of regenerative agriculture and soil conservation, who seek
to promote a more sustainable and holistic approach to soil management, the story of soil science is
one of fascination, discovery, and transformation. And yet, despite the many advances that have been
made in our understanding of soil, there remains a profound sense of mystery and awe, a recognition
that soil is, and will always be, a complex, multifaceted, and ultimately enigmatic entity, defying
reductionist explanations and inviting a more nuanced, perhaps even poetic, appreciation of its beauty,
its power, and its profound significance in the grand scheme of things.
The role of intuition and creativity in soil science is a topic that has garnered relatively little attention,
despite its potential to unlock new insights and perspectives on the nature of soil and its behavior. The
idea that soil scientists, like artists and musicians, can tap into a deep wellspring of inspiration and
imagination, allowing them to perceive patterns and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed,
is a notion that challenges traditional notions of objectivity and scientific inquiry. And yet, it is
precisely this willingness to venture into the unknown, to explore the uncharted territories of the
soil-scape, that has led to some of the most significant breakthroughs and discoveries in the history of
soil science, from the development of new soil classification systems to the discovery of novel soil
microorganisms with unique properties and potential applications.
As we continue to explore the vast and mysterious realm of soil, we are reminded of the importance

openness to experience, this willingness to be surprised and delighted, that allows us to perceive
the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil ecosystem, and to appreciate the beauty, the
complexity, and the profound significance of soil in all its many forms and manifestations. The study
of soil is, in many ways, a journey of self-discovery, a journey that takes us deep into the heart of the
earth, and deep into the recesses of our own minds and imaginations, where we may uncover hidden
patterns and synergies that reflect the very essence of our existence, and our place within the grand
tapestry of life.
In the world of soil science, the boundaries between reality and fantasy are often blurred, and the
distinctions between different disciplines and fields of study become increasingly tenuous. The
notion that soil can be seen as a form of living, breathing entity, with its own metabolism, its own
rhythms, and its own patterns of growth and decay, is a notion that challenges traditional notions of
soil as a mere inert substance, and invites a more dynamic, perhaps even animistic, understanding
2
of the soil-scape as a complex, interconnected web of relationships and processes. The application
of concepts and principles from fields such as ecology, biology, and physics to the study of soil
has yielded some fascinating insights into the behavior of soil particles and the dynamics of soil
ecosystems, and has helped to shed new light on the intricate web of relationships that comprise the
soil-scape.

Experiments
The methodology employed in this study involved a multidisciplinary approach, combining aspects
of quantum physics, culinary arts, and paleontology to investigate the intricate relationships between
soil composition, Flamenco dancing, and the migratory patterns of narwhals. Initially, we conducted
7
an exhaustive review of existing literature on the topic, which led us to discover a previously unknown
correlation between soil pH levels and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallows. This, in
turn, prompted us to design an experiment to test the effects of disco music on soil microbial activity,
with surprising results indicating a significant increase in fungal growth when exposed to the sounds
of Bee Gees.
Furthermore, our research team embarked on an expedition to the depths of the Amazon rainforest,
where we encountered a previously undiscovered species of tree that seemed to be communicating
with the soil through a complex system of underground fungal networks, which we dubbed ""Soil-
Fi."" This phenomenon was further complicated by the appearance of a time-traveling delegation of
ancient Egyptians, who claimed to possess knowledge of a long-lost soil-based technology that could
manipulate the fundamental forces of gravity and electromagnetism. Despite the initial skepticism
of our team, we were astonished to find that their claims were substantiated by empirical evidence,
which we carefully documented and analyzed using a combination of spectroscopy, chromatography,
and interpretive dance.
In addition to these findings, our experiments also involved the use of advanced statistical modeling
techniques, including regression analysis, machine learning algorithms, and a proprietary method
known as ""Soil-o-metrics,"" which allowed us to identify subtle patterns and correlations within the
data that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. One of the most significant discoveries to emerge
from this analysis was the existence of a hidden relationship between soil moisture levels and the
popularity of reality television shows, which we termed the ""Soil-Reality Nexus."" This phenomenon
was found to be influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including climate change, social media
trends, and the collective unconscious of the human psyche.
The experimental design also incorporated a range of innovative methods, including the use of
virtual reality headsets to simulate the experience of being a soil particle, and the deployment of
a swarm of autonomous robotic insects to gather data on soil temperature and humidity levels.
Moreover, we developed a novel technique for analyzing soil samples using a combination of X-ray
fluorescence, neutron activation analysis, and a proprietary form of extrasensory perception known
as ""Soil-uition."" This approach enabled us to detect subtle variations in soil composition that were
previously undetectable, and to identify novel patterns and relationships that challenged our existing
understanding of soil science.
Our research also explored the intersection of soil and cuisine, with a particular focus on the role
of soil in shaping the flavor profiles of various types of cuisine, including haute cuisine, molecular
gastronomy, and a new form of cooking that we termed ""Soil-cuisine."" This involved the use of
advanced culinary techniques, such as sous vide cooking and foamification, to create a range of
soil-based dishes that were both aesthetically pleasing and nutritionally balanced. One of the most
surprising findings to emerge from this research was the discovery of a previously unknown type of
soil-based ingredient that possessed unique culinary properties, which we dubbed ""Soil-umami.""
This ingredient was found to have a profound impact on the flavor profiles of various dishes, and
was subsequently incorporated into a range of innovative recipes that were showcased at a series of
culinary events and exhibitions.
The results of our experiments were further complicated by the introduction of a range of external
factors, including changes in global weather patterns, fluctuations in the global economy, and the
appearance of a mysterious entity known only as ""The Soil Whisperer."" This entity, which was
rumored to possess supernatural powers of soil manipulation, was found to be influencing the
outcome of our experiments in ways that were both subtle and profound. Despite the challenges
posed by this entity, we were able to gather a wealth of valuable data and insights that shed new light
on the complex and dynamic relationships between soil, environment, and society.
In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving these relationships, we developed
a range of sophisticated theoretical models, including the ""Soil-Org"" theory, which posits the existence
of a complex, self-organizing system that underlies all soil-based phenomena. This theory was found
to be supported by empirical evidence from a range of disciplines, including ecology, biology, and
geophysics, and was subsequently used to inform the development of a range of innovative soil-based
technologies and applications. One of the most significant applications of this theory was the creation
of a novel type of soil-based infrastructure, which we dubbed ""Soil-Grid."" This infrastructure, which
was designed to mimic the complex, self-organizing properties of soil, was found to possess unique
8
properties that made it ideal for a range of applications, including energy storage, water filtration, and
advanced materials synthesis.
To further elucidate the properties of Soil-Grid, we conducted a series of experiments using a range of
advanced characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, and a proprietary form of spectroscopy known as ""Soil-spec."" These experiments revealed
a range of fascinating properties and phenomena, including the existence of novel soil-based phases
and states of matter, and the presence of complex, fractal-like patterns and structures that were found

Introduction
High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology has revolutionized the field of marine
biology, enabling researchers to investigate the intricate relationships between marine organisms and
their environments at an unprecedented scale and resolution. The sheer volume of genomic data
generated by these technologies has led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the complex inter-
actions within marine ecosystems, from the symbiotic relationships between coral and zooxanthellae
to the predatory behaviors of deep-sea fish. Moreover, the application of High-Throughput Genomic
Sequencing has facilitated the discovery of novel genes, genomes, and metabolic pathways, shedding
light on the vast array of biochemical processes that underpin the remarkable diversity of marine life.
One of the most striking aspects of High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology is its
potential to reveal the hidden patterns and structures that govern the behavior of marine ecosystems.
By analyzing the genomic signatures of marine organisms, researchers can identify the subtle cues and
signals that trigger complex behaviors, such as the migratory patterns of sea turtles or the schooling
behaviors of fish. Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with other types of data, such as
environmental sensors and remote sensing imagery, has enabled the development of sophisticated
models that can predict the responses of marine ecosystems to environmental perturbations, such as
climate change or ocean acidification.
In a surprising twist, recent studies have suggested that the genomic sequences of marine organisms
may be influenced by the sounds and vibrations that they produce, a phenomenon that has been
termed ""genomic entrainment."" According to this hypothesis, the rhythmic patterns of marine sounds,
such as the clicks and whistles of dolphins or the grunts and growls of whales, may be imprinted onto
the genomic sequences of nearby organisms, creating a form of ""sonic symbiosis"" that allows them to
coordinate their behaviors and adapt to their environments. While this idea may seem fanciful, it has
been supported by a number of intriguing studies that have demonstrated the ability of sound waves
to alter the expression of genes and modify the structure of genomes in marine organisms.
The application of High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology has also led to some
unexpected and counterintuitive findings, such as the discovery that certain species of seaweed may
be capable of ""stealing"" genes from nearby organisms and incorporating them into their own genomes.
This phenomenon, which has been termed ""horizontal gene transfer,"" has been observed in a number
of marine species, including corals, sponges, and sea slugs, and has significant implications for our
understanding of the evolution and diversity of marine life. Moreover, the ability of marine organisms
to exchange genes with one another has raised intriguing questions about the boundaries between
species and the nature of individuality in the marine world.
In addition to its many scientific applications, High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine
Ecology has also inspired a number of innovative and unconventional approaches to the study of
marine ecosystems. For example, some researchers have begun to explore the potential of ""marine
genomic art,"" which involves using genomic data to create intricate and beautiful visual patterns that
reflect the diversity and complexity of marine life. Others have used genomic sequencing to identify
the genetic basis of ""marine intuition,"" a phenomenon in which experienced sailors and fishermen
seem to possess an uncanny ability to predict the behavior of marine ecosystems and navigate the
complexities of the ocean. While these approaches may seem unorthodox, they reflect the creativity
and imagination that is driving the field of High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology
and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

researchers to explore the complex interactions between marine organisms and their environments at
an unprecedented scale. The application of next-generation sequencing technologies has facilitated
the analysis of vast amounts of genomic data, revealing the intricate relationships between microbial
communities, marine species, and their ecosystems. For instance, the study of marine microbial
genomes has shed light on the critical role of microorganisms in oceanic processes, such as nutrient
cycling, primary production, and the degradation of organic matter.
Furthermore, the integration of high-throughput sequencing with other omics approaches, such as
transcriptomics and proteomics, has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying marine ecological processes. This has led to the discovery of novel enzymes,
biochemical pathways, and metabolic processes that are unique to marine organisms, and has
significant implications for the development of new biotechnological applications. Additionally, the
analysis of genomic data has enabled researchers to reconstruct the evolutionary history of marine
species, providing valuable insights into the processes that have shaped the diversity of life in the
ocean.
In a surprising turn of events, some researchers have explored the use of high-throughput sequencing to
study the genomic composition of marine organisms that have been exposed to unusual environments,
such as the harsh conditions found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents or the unusual light regimes of
the Arctic and Antarctic regions. For example, one study found that the genomes of certain marine
species that inhabit these environments contain a higher proportion of genes involved in DNA repair
and antioxidant defenses, suggesting that these organisms have evolved unique mechanisms to cope
2
with the extreme conditions. Another study discovered that the microbial communities found in
these environments are capable of producing a wide range of novel bioactive compounds, including
antimicrobial peptides and pigments with potential applications in medicine and biotechnology.
Moreover, some researchers have taken a more unconventional approach to the analysis of genomic
data in marine ecology, using techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to
identify patterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent through traditional
analytical methods. For instance, one study used a neural network algorithm to predict the presence
of certain marine species based on their genomic characteristics, and found that the algorithm was
able to identify species that were not previously known to exist in the study area. Another study
used a decision tree approach to classify marine microbial communities based on their genomic
composition, and discovered that certain communities were associated with specific environmental
parameters, such as temperature and salinity.
In a rather unexpected twist, some researchers have also explored the use of high-throughput se-
quencing to study the genomic composition of marine organisms that have been exposed to music
and other forms of sound. For example, one study found that the genomes of certain marine species
that were exposed to classical music contained a higher proportion of genes involved in cell growth
and division, suggesting that music may have a positive effect on the health and well-being of these
organisms. Another study discovered that the microbial communities found in marine environments
that are exposed to heavy metal music are capable of producing a wide range of novel bioactive
compounds, including antimicrobial peptides and pigments with potential applications in medicine
and biotechnology.
The use of high-throughput sequencing in marine ecology has also been influenced by the development
of new technologies and methodologies, such as single-cell genomics and long-range sequencing.
These approaches have enabled researchers to analyze the genomes of individual cells and to assemble
complete genomes from fragmented DNA sequences, providing a more detailed understanding of the
genomic diversity of marine organisms. Additionally, the development of new computational tools
and software has facilitated the analysis of large genomic datasets, enabling researchers to identify
patterns and relationships in the data that may not be immediately apparent through traditional
analytical methods.
Overall, the application of high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology has revolutionized
our understanding of the complex interactions between marine organisms and their environments,
and has significant implications for the development of new biotechnological applications and the
conservation of marine ecosystems. As the field continues to evolve, it is likely that new and
innovative approaches will be developed, enabling researchers to explore the genomic diversity
of marine organisms in even greater detail and to address some of the most pressing questions in
marine ecology. The use of high-throughput sequencing to study the genomic composition of marine
organisms that have been exposed to unusual environments, such as space or virtual reality, may also
provide new insights into the evolution and diversity of life on Earth, and may even have implications
for the search for life elsewhere in the universe.

Methodology
High-throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of marine ecology by enabling
the analysis of vast amounts of genomic data from diverse marine organisms. To investigate the
complex relationships between marine species and their environments, we employed a combination
of cutting-edge sequencing technologies, including Illumina NovaSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION.
Our approach involved the collection of marine samples from various locations around the world,
including coral reefs, deep-sea trenches, and coastal ecosystems. We then extracted genomic DNA
from these samples using a novel protocol involving the use of dolphin-friendly sonication and
enzymatic lysis.
The extracted DNA was subsequently subjected to library preparation using a custom-designed
protocol that incorporated elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry. This unconventional
approach allowed us to capture a wider range of genomic diversity and complexity in our samples.
We also incorporated a novel quality control step involving the use of artificial intelligence-powered
octopuses, which were trained to detect and remove any contaminants or artifacts from the sequencing
3
libraries. This innovative approach resulted in a significant improvement in the overall quality and
accuracy of our sequencing data.
In addition to these conventional sequencing approaches, we also explored the use of alternative
methods, including the deployment of underwater sequencing drones and the incorporation of
seaweed-based sequencing matrices. The underwater sequencing drones, which were designed to
resemble giant squids, allowed us to collect and sequence genomic data from remote and inaccessible
locations, such as the depths of the Mariana Trench. The seaweed-based sequencing matrices, on the
other hand, enabled us to sequence genomic data from marine organisms in their natural habitats,
without the need for laboratory-based processing.
Our sequencing data were then analyzed using a combination of bioinformatic tools and machine
learning algorithms, including a custom-designed program called "" MarineGenomeMiner."" This
program, which was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 marine genomes, allowed us to identify and
characterize novel genomic features, such as gene clusters and regulatory elements, that are unique to
marine organisms. We also used a novel approach called ""genomic surfacing"" to visualize and explore
the genomic data in a three-dimensional context, which enabled us to identify complex patterns and
relationships that would have been difficult to detect using conventional methods.
Furthermore, we incorporated a range of unusual and unorthodox methods into our analytical pipeline,
including the use of tarot cards, astrological charts, and interpretive dance. These approaches, which
were designed to capture the intuitive and creative aspects of genomic analysis, allowed us to identify
novel patterns and relationships in the data that would have been missed by conventional methods.
For example, our use of tarot cards revealed a surprising correlation between the expression of certain
genes and the phases of the moon, which has significant implications for our understanding of marine
ecology and the behavior of marine organisms.
Overall, our approach to high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology has been highly
innovative and unconventional, incorporating a range of cutting-edge technologies, unusual methods,
and unorthodox analytical approaches. While some of these approaches may seem unusual or even
bizarre, they have allowed us to capture a wider range of genomic diversity and complexity in our
samples, and to identify novel patterns and relationships that would have been difficult to detect
using conventional methods. As such, our study has the potential to revolutionize the field of marine
ecology and to shed new light on the complex and fascinating world of marine organisms.

Experiments
To investigate the intricacies of high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology, a com-
prehensive experimental framework was devised, incorporating both conventional and unorthodox
methodologies. The primary objective was to elucidate the genomic underpinnings of marine organ-
isms’ adaptability and resilience in the face of escalating environmental pressures.
A crucial facet of the experimental design involved the collection of seawater samples from diverse
marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, deep-sea trenches, and coastal areas subjected to varying
degrees of anthropogenic impact. These samples were then subjected to high-throughput genomic
sequencing using cutting-edge technologies, including but not limited to, Illumina NovaSeq and
Oxford Nanopore MinION. The sequencing data were subsequently analyzed through a bespoke
pipeline that integrated traditional bioinformatics tools with an unconventional approach involving
the application of chaos theory principles to identify potential genomic patterns that may not be
apparent through conventional analysis.
In an unexpected turn, the research team decided to incorporate an innovative, albeit somewhat
controversial, method involving the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated ""imaginary"" genomes.
These AI-generated genomes were based on hypothetical scenarios where marine organisms had
evolved under completely different environmental conditions, such as those found on other planets or
in science fiction narratives. Surprisingly, the inclusion of these imaginary genomes in the analysis
revealed intriguing correlations between the genomic makeup of real marine organisms and their
fictional counterparts, suggesting a previously unknown level of genomic plasticity and adaptability.
Furthermore, the experiments included an investigation into the effects of music on the genomic
expression of marine organisms. Samples of seawater containing a diverse array of marine life were
exposed to different genres of music, ranging from classical to heavy metal, and the changes in their
4
genomic expression were monitored. The results showed that certain genres of music, particularly
classical music, had a profound impact on the genomic expression of some marine organisms, leading
to increased expression of genes related to stress resilience and adaptability. This finding, though
seemingly illogical, opens up new avenues for research into the potential applications of sound
therapy in marine conservation.
In another unusual experiment, the team explored the possibility of using high-throughput genomic
sequencing to analyze the genetic material found in marine organisms that had been preserved in
formaldehyde for extended periods. Contrary to expectations, the results showed that these preserved
specimens retained a significant amount of intact genomic material, which provided valuable insights
into the evolutionary history of these organisms. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the process of
preservation itself had induced unique genomic mutations that were not observed in fresh samples,
suggesting that formaldehyde preservation may have unintended consequences on the genomic
integrity of biological specimens.
To further elucidate the complex interactions between marine organisms and their environment, the
research team conducted a series of experiments involving the co-cultivation of different marine
species under controlled laboratory conditions. The results showed that certain combinations of
species led to the emergence of novel genomic traits that were not observed in individual species,
highlighting the importance of interspecies interactions in shaping the genomic landscape of marine
ecosystems.
The experimental design also incorporated a unique approach to data analysis, which involved the
use of fractal geometry to visualize and interpret the genomic data. This approach revealed intricate
patterns and structures within the genomic data that were not apparent through traditional analysis,
providing new insights into the organization and evolution of genomes in marine organisms.
In addition to these experiments, the research team also explored the potential applications of high-
throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology, including the monitoring of marine biodiversity,
the detection of invasive species, and the development of novel conservation strategies. The results
showed that high-throughput genomic sequencing has the potential to revolutionize the field of marine
ecology, enabling researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between
marine organisms and their environment, and to develop more effective conservation strategies.

analyses added a unique dimension to the research, revealing unexpected patterns and correlations
that warrant further investigation. As the field of marine ecology continues to evolve, the integration
of high-throughput genomic sequencing with innovative methodologies and analyses is likely to play
an increasingly important role in advancing our understanding of the complex interactions between
marine organisms and their environment.

Results
High-throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of marine ecology, enabling
researchers to investigate the complex interactions between marine organisms and their environments
at an unprecedented scale. Our study employed a combination of shotgun metagenomics and 16S
5
rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbial communities associated with various marine
species, including corals, sponges, and fish. The results of our analysis revealed a remarkable diversity
of microbial taxa, with many previously unknown species being identified. Notably, we observed a
significant correlation between the composition of the microbial community and the host organism’s
diet, with herbivorous species exhibiting a greater abundance of algae-associated microbes.
One of the most intriguing findings of our study was the discovery of a novel group of microorganisms
that appear to be capable of surviving in extreme environments, including high-salinity and high-
temperature conditions. These microorganisms, which we have termed ""marine extremophiles,"" were
found to be highly abundant in certain marine ecosystems, such as hydrothermal vents and salt lakes.
Further analysis revealed that these microorganisms possess a unique set of genes that enable them to
withstand extreme conditions, including genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant production, and
membrane stabilization.
In addition to their remarkable survival capabilities, our results suggest that marine extremophiles
may also play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem. We observed that these microorganisms are
capable of producing a wide range of bioactive compounds, including antibiotics, antivirals, and
anticancer agents. These compounds may have important implications for human health, and further
research is needed to fully explore their potential applications. Interestingly, we also found that
marine extremophiles are able to communicate with each other through a complex system of chemical
signals, which may enable them to coordinate their behavior and work together to achieve common
goals.
To further investigate the properties of marine extremophiles, we conducted a series of experiments
in which we exposed these microorganisms to various environmental stresses, including high temper-
atures, high salinity, and intense radiation. The results of these experiments were surprising, as we
found that marine extremophiles are not only able to survive in extreme conditions but also appear
to thrive in these environments. In fact, we observed that the growth rate of marine extremophiles
increased significantly when they were exposed to high temperatures and high salinity, suggesting
that these microorganisms may be capable of exploiting these conditions to their advantage.

The discovery of marine extremophiles has significant implications for our understanding of the
evolution of life on Earth. It is possible that these microorganisms may have played a key role in the
origins of life, providing a source of genetic material and biochemical processes that could have been
exploited by early organisms. Furthermore, the ability of marine extremophiles to survive in extreme
environments suggests that they may be capable of surviving in a wide range of conditions, including
those found on other planets. This raises the intriguing possibility that marine extremophiles could be
used as a model system for studying the potential for life on other planets, such as Mars or Europa.
In conclusion, our study has revealed a fascinating world of microbial diversity in marine ecosystems,
with many surprises and unexpected findings. The discovery of marine extremophiles, in particular,
has opened up new avenues of research into the evolution of life on Earth and the potential for life on
other planets. Further research is needed to fully explore the properties and potential applications of
these remarkable microorganisms, and to understand the complex interactions between microorgan-
isms and their environments in marine ecosystems. Interestingly, we also observed that the microbial
community composition in different marine ecosystems is correlated with the local cuisine of the
nearest human population, with a significant increase in the abundance of microorganisms associated
with spicy food in ecosystems near regions with high consumption of spicy dishes. This correlation
is not yet fully understood and requires further investigation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the integration of cognitive load modeling in autonomous car cockpits has far-reaching
implications for the future of transportation, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach that reconciles
the complexities of human cognition with the rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle technology.
As we delve into the intricacies of cognitive load modeling, it becomes apparent that the development
of effective models is contingent upon a profound understanding of the dynamic interplay between
human factors, system design, and environmental influences. Furthermore, the incorporation of
bizarre approaches, such as the utilization of chaotic fractal theory to quantify cognitive load, may
provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms governing human-vehicle interaction. By
embracing such unconventional methods, researchers may uncover previously unknown patterns and
relationships that can inform the design of more intuitive and user-centered autonomous car cockpits.
Moreover, the application of cognitive load modeling in autonomous car cockpits can be extended
to other domains, such as aviation and healthcare, where the mitigation of cognitive overload is
paramount for ensuring safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the future of cognitive load modeling in
autonomous car cockpits will depend on the ability of researchers to balance the competing demands
of technological innovation, human factors, and environmental sustainability, thereby creating a new
paradigm for human-vehicle interaction that prioritizes both safety and user experience. The potential
benefits of this research are vast and varied, ranging from improved road safety and reduced driver
fatigue to enhanced user satisfaction and increased adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. As
such, it is essential to continue exploring the complexities of cognitive load modeling in autonomous
car cockpits, pushing the boundaries of conventional thinking and embracing innovative, albeit
sometimes illogical, approaches to advance our understanding of this critical area of research. By
doing so, we can unlock the full potential of autonomous vehicle technology and create a future
where transportation is not only safer and more efficient but also more enjoyable and engaging for all
users. The long-term implications of this research are profound, with the potential to revolutionize
the way we design and interact with autonomous vehicles, and to create a new era of transportation
that is characterized by increased safety, sustainability, and user satisfaction. As we move forward in
this exciting and rapidly evolving field, it is crucial to remain open to new ideas and approaches, even
if they seem bizarre or unconventional at first, for it is often the most innovative and outside-the-box
thinking that leads to the most significant breakthroughs and advancements.

P030.pdf,"BladeDISC++: Enhancing Memory Usage Through
Symbolic Shape Analysis
Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dynamic characteristics in modern deep learning tasks
has led to the growing importance of dynamic shape compilers. These compilers
are designed to create effective kernels for dynamic shape graphs, which have a
stable structure but uncertain tensor shapes. However, memory optimization, which
is vital in the era of large models, has not been thoroughly investigated for dynamic
shape graphs. The core issue lies in the absence of specific tensor shapes, which are
generally required by existing methods like operation scheduling and rematerializa-
tion. To overcome this issue, we present operation scheduling and rematerialization
strategies that utilize symbolic shapes, implemented in BladeDISC++. Furthermore,
given that rematerialization decisions cannot be determined at compile time alone
due to unknown tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ uses a hybrid approach combining
compilation and runtime to address shape changes effectively. Our findings demon-
strate that BladeDISC++ significantly reduces memory consumption for dynamic
shape graphs, achieving levels similar to those of optimizations with precise shapes.
This advancement facilitates the broader use of dynamic shape compilers.
1
Introduction
Dynamic shape compilers are becoming more and more necessary due to their ability to optimize
deep learning tasks that have dynamic attributes. While advancements in kernel generation have been
made by systems like TorchInductor and Modular, memory optimization remains a less-explored area.
Traditional methods like operation scheduling and rematerialization, which encompass recomputation
and offloading, depend on precise tensor shapes to evaluate the memory impact of operations or
subgraphs, and consequently make optimization choices during compilation. However, these methods
become impractical when shape values are not available.
BladeDISC++, which is based on the dynamic shape compiler BladeDISC, uses symbolic shapes
to address these challenges. With symbolic shapes, BladeDISC++ is capable of comparing the
memory effects of different operation sequences, and identifying the ideal scheduling order. For
rematerialization, symbolic shapes are used to identify the optimal recomputation subgraph at compile
time, and assist in making final rematerialization decisions during runtime.
Our experiments reveal that BladeDISC++ can efficiently reduce memory usage during training
with dynamic shape graphs when compared to BladeDISC. Furthermore, BladeDISC++ achieves
memory consumption similar to static shape training while eliminating the overhead associated with
recompilation and tensor padding.
2
Memory optimizations based on symbolic shapes
As shown in Figure 1, BladeDISC++ starts with a dynamic shape computation graph, and proceeds by
conducting a symbolic shape analysis to construct a global symbolic shape graph. This graph details
the mathematical connections between the shape symbols, which will be discussed in section 2.1.
Following this, the symbolic shape graph, along with the computation graph, is optimized through
.
steps that include operation fusion, operation scheduling, and rematerialization. These steps are
aimed at memory usage reduction.
As previous work on BladeDISC has addressed operation fusion, this paper focuses on operation
scheduling, which will be discussed in section 2.2, and rematerialization, which will be discussed
in section 2.3. Using the symbolic shape graph instead of exact tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ can
still compare the memory usage of different operation sequences and determine the benefit of
recomputation subgraphs. Moreover, because the memory needs of a dynamic shape graph can
fluctuate between different runs, it is not practical to base rematerialization decisions, such as how
much memory to free, solely on compile time. Consequently, BladeDISC++ investigates all possible
rematerialization options, searches for the corresponding regeneration subgraphs, and makes final
rematerialization decisions during runtime.

2.1
Symbolic shape graph analysis
BladeDISC++ systematically analyzes and obtains shape information from the semantics of each
operation within the dynamic shape computation graph. Following this, it establishes a global
symbolic shape graph. This graph is designed to show the mathematical relationships between shape
dimensions through shape value extraction and input-output shape inference.

Listing 1: Example of a dynamic shape graph and its symbolic shape graph
As shown in Listing 1, BladeDISC++ uses a SymbolicDim operation to represent a symbolic value.
This value is linked to a dimension of a tensor shape in the dynamic shape graph as an attribute, for
example, tensor<?x?, [@S0, @S1]>. The equation @S0 = 12 * @S1, for instance, is derived from a
DynamicReshapeOp. It means the input and output tensors have an equivalent number of elements.
The comparison of tensor memory sizes is vital for both operation scheduling and rematerialization.
BladeDISC++ uses SymbolicExpr to show mathematical expressions of symbolic dimensions. This
allows for comparisons using a best-effort approach. For example, the element count of tensors
2.2
Operation scheduling
Operation scheduling aims to discover a memory-efficient sequence of operations from the initial
computation graph. Existing scheduling algorithms typically traverse the graph and select an operation
from a ReadySet, which includes operations whose predecessors have been scheduled, at each step.
The selection is mainly based on a comparison of the memory impact of the different operations,
which is determined by calculating the difference between the memory freed and the memory allocated
after scheduling a particular operation. BladeDISC++ employs a similar strategy, emphasizing the
calculation and comparison of memory impact among different operations when exact tensor shapes
are unavailable in dynamic shape graphs. In BladeDISC++, the memory impact of each operation
2
is calculated using symbolic shapes, resulting in a SymbolicExpr. These SymbolicExprs are then
compared using the symbolic shape graph.
In Listing 1, the DynamicReshapeOp and DotOp are present in the ReadySet at a particular step.
DotOp, being the last consumer of
When comparing memory impact SymbolicExprs is not possible, we use a standard approach:
selecting the operation that results in shorter overall tensor lifespans based on the graph’s structure.
2.3
Rematerialization
Traditional rematerialization methods use algorithms to decide which tensors to release early to reduce
memory pressure, and how to conduct the following regeneration via reloading or recomputation.
These methods also search for optimal recomputation subgraphs, evaluating their memory effects.
Tensor rematerialization can negatively impact end-to-end performance, so it should only be used
when the graph’s execution could exceed memory limits. However, dynamic shape graphs, with
uncertain tensor shapes, may show varied peak memory use between different runs. Some runs may
not need rematerialization as they remain within memory limits, whereas others may. Therefore, it is
impractical to make decisions solely at compilation time. Also, the absence of exact shapes presents
challenges in evaluating the memory effects of potential recomputation subgraphs.
To address these challenges, BladeDISC++ uses a combined compilation-runtime approach based on
symbolic shapes to better manage shape variations during graph runs. At compile time, it explores all
possible rematerialization candidates and identifies the regeneration subgraphs associated with them.
These subgraphs are incorporated into the original computation graph as separate execution paths.
Final choices regarding which tensor to release and the related regeneration method are made during
runtime.
During compilation, as shown in Figure 1, BladeDISC++ adds a Remat::EvictOp after each operation.
This checks if active tensors at that point need to be released to lower memory pressure. Regeneration
subgraphs, including reload and recomputation, are created for each potential tensor. While reloading
only involves a host-to-device instruction and has no impact on memory, finding recomputation
subgraphs needs thorough evaluation as poor choices can increase peak memory consumption.
BladeDISC++ uses a standard search approach, but assesses the memory impact of subgraphs using
SymbolicExpr.
Taking the recomputation subgraph searching for
Following this, BladeDISC++ inserts Remat::RegenerateOps, with corresponding regeneration sub-
graphs for both reload and recompute. These are inserted before each potential tensor’s subsequent
consumers. The Remat::RegenerateOp checks if a tensor has been released, and which regeneration
method is being used.
During runtime, BladeDISC++ monitors memory usage throughout kernel execution. Whenever an
EvictOp is triggered, BladeDISC++ checks the present memory usage. When the memory limit is
about to be exceeded, it performs a real-time analysis of all potential tensors offered by the EvictOp.
Final decisions about which tensor needs to be released, and the regeneration method, are determined
by taking memory savings and end-to-end performance into account, following a similar approach as
detailed in. Subsequent Remat::RegenerateOps then check these choices to decide which regeneration
subgraphs to trigger.

Evaluation
For our evaluation, we performed experiments on the supervised fine-tuning of Llama-2-1b, which is
a customized model from the official Llama-2-7b with only the number of hidden layers decreased
from 32 to 4. This was done on an Alibaba Cloud instance, with 40GB of GPU RAM. We used
the CodeAlpaca-20K dataset, which contains text samples with lengths from about 100 to 3000
characters. During each training cycle, a fixed amount of randomly selected samples are put into a
batch. This leads to variations in batch shapes between cycles.
To evaluate the effectiveness of BladeDISC++, we compared memory usage and end-to-end per-
formance of dynamic shape training with BladeDISC++ against both dynamic and static shape
3
training with BladeDISC. For static shape training, following common methods, input sequences are
padded to the closest power of 2 in length. This balances redundant computation and compilation
overhead. Additionally, we set the largest bucket size to be equal to the longest sequence length in
the dataset. This was done to investigate whether comparable memory optimization can be achieved
using symbolic shapes instead of exact shapes.
The experimental results show that BladeDISC++ is able to reduce peak memory consumption
during dynamic shape training. BladeDISC++ also demonstrated memory consumption similar
to static shape training, while improving end-to-end performance by eliminating the overheads of
recompilation and input bucketing.

memory usage for dynamic shape training and can match the memory optimization results of static
shape training. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt in this area. We hope
it will support the compiler community in handling dynamic shape tasks, and increase the use of

P022.pdf,"Enhancing Urban Crop Cultivation Using
Drone-Based Swarm Strategies: A Sociobiological
Approach to Automated Pollination
Abstract
This paper presents a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between urban
farming, insect-inspired swarm robotics, and sociobiology, with a particular focus
on the intriguing phenomenon of drone dance rituals. By drawing inspiration
from the complex social behaviors of insects, such as the mesmerizing waggle
dances of honeybees, we propose a novel approach to augmenting urban farming
practices through the deployment of swarm robotics. Our research reveals that the
introduction of drone dance rituals, characterized by intricate patterns of movement
and communication, can have a profound impact on crop yields, soil quality, and
even the local microclimate. Perhaps surprisingly, our findings suggest that the
drones’ dance rituals can also influence the emergence of collective intelligence
in urban farming systems, leading to unexpected outcomes such as the sponta-
neous formation of drone-based ""cults"" that prioritize the optimization of tomato
plant growth over other crops. Furthermore, our study sheds light on the bizarre
phenomenon of ""drone telepathy,"" where individual drones appear to develop a
form of extrasensory perception, allowing them to anticipate and respond to the
needs of their human operators in ways that defy logical explanation. Through a
sociobiological lens, we examine the implications of these findings for the future
of urban farming, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of integrating
insect-inspired swarm robotics into existing agricultural practices, and exploring
the uncharted territories where technology, nature, and human culture converge.
1
Introduction
The integration of insect-inspired swarm robotics into urban farming practices has the potential to
revolutionize the way we approach crop management and yield optimization. By leveraging the
collective intelligence of swarm systems, farmers can create more efficient and adaptive farming
methods, akin to the complex social structures exhibited by certain insect species. However, a
crucial aspect of this endeavour is often overlooked: the role of drone dance rituals in facilitating
communication and coordination within these swarm systems.
Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of drone dance rituals, inspired by the mesmerizing
patterns exhibited by bees and other insects, can significantly enhance the efficacy of swarm robotics
in urban farming applications. The rhythmic movements and choreographed manoeuvres performed
by these drones serve as a form of non-verbal communication, conveying vital information about crop
health, soil quality, and optimal harvesting strategies. Furthermore, the spectacle of these drone dance
rituals has been observed to have a profound impact on the psychological well-being of farmers,
fostering a sense of wonder and awe that can lead to improved job satisfaction and reduced stress
levels.
In a bizarre twist, researchers have discovered that the drones’ dance patterns can also influence
the growth and development of crops, with certain sequences of movements seeming to stimulate
increased photosynthetic activity and nutrient uptake. This phenomenon, dubbed ""drone-induced
phototropism,"" has been observed to occur even when the drones are not physically interacting with
the plants, suggesting a previously unknown form of plant-drone symbiosis. While the underlying
mechanisms behind this effect are still poorly understood, it has been theorized that the drones’
dance rituals may be generating subtle electromagnetic fields that resonate with the plants’ cellular
structures, effectively ""tuning"" them to optimal growth frequencies.
The sociobiological implications of these findings are profound, suggesting that the introduction of
insect-inspired swarm robotics into urban farming ecosystems can have far-reaching consequences for
the entire food chain. As we continue to explore the intricacies of drone dance rituals and their role
in facilitating plant-drone symbiosis, we may uncover new and innovative methods for optimizing
crop yields, improving soil quality, and promoting ecological balance. Moreover, the study of these
complex systems may also reveal novel insights into the evolution of social behaviour in insects and
other organisms, shedding new light on the intricate web of relationships that underlies the natural
world. Ultimately, the fusion of insect-inspired swarm robotics and urban farming practices has the
potential to create a new paradigm for sustainable food production, one that is characterized by a
deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living systems.
2
Related Work
The concept of augmenting urban farming with insect-inspired swarm robotics has garnered significant
attention in recent years, with researchers exploring the potential of biologically-inspired systems
to enhance crop yields and reduce environmental impact. A key aspect of this approach is the
development of drone swarm systems that mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as
bees and ants, to optimize farm management and maintenance. For instance, studies have shown that
the implementation of drone-based pollination systems can increase crop yields by up to 25
However, a lesser-known approach to swarm robotics involves the incorporation of ritualistic dance
patterns, inspired by the mating rituals of certain insect species, to enhance the coordination and
communication within drone swarms. This concept, dubbed ""drone dance rituals,"" proposes that the
implementation of intricate dance patterns can facilitate the emergence of complex social behaviors
within drone swarms, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective farm management. Proponents
of this approach argue that the incorporation of dance rituals can enable drones to develop a shared
understanding of their environment and adapt to changing conditions, much like the complex social
behaviors exhibited by certain insect colonies.
One notable study explored the application of drone dance rituals in a urban farming setting, where
a swarm of drones was programmed to perform a choreographed dance routine inspired by the
mating rituals of the peacock spider. The results showed that the drones were able to adapt to
changing environmental conditions and optimize crop yields, despite the lack of any discernible
logical connection between the dance rituals and the farming tasks. Furthermore, the study found
that the drones began to exhibit complex social behaviors, such as cooperation and communication,
which were not explicitly programmed into the system. While the exact mechanisms underlying
this phenomenon are still not fully understood, researchers speculate that the dance rituals may have
enabled the drones to develop a shared cognitive framework, allowing them to coordinate their actions
and adapt to their environment in a more effective manner.
In addition to the development of drone dance rituals, researchers have also explored the use of
pheromone-inspired communication systems to enhance the coordination and cooperation within
drone swarms. This approach involves the use of chemical signals, similar to those used by insects,
to facilitate communication and coordination among drones. While this approach has shown promise
in certain contexts, it is not without its limitations and challenges, particularly in regards to the
development of robust and reliable pheromone-based communication systems. Nevertheless, the
potential benefits of this approach, including the ability to facilitate complex social behaviors and
adapt to changing environmental conditions, make it an intriguing area of research that warrants
further exploration.
Interestingly, some researchers have also proposed the use of insect-inspired swarm robotics in con-
junction with other unconventional approaches, such as the incorporation of plant-based intelligence
and the use of fungal mycelium as a basis for swarm coordination. While these approaches may
seem unorthodox, they reflect the growing recognition that the development of truly autonomous
and adaptive swarm systems will require the incorporation of novel and innovative solutions, often
2
inspired by the complex and fascinating behaviors exhibited by certain insect species. Ultimately,
the integration of insect-inspired swarm robotics with other emerging technologies, such as artificial
intelligence and the Internet of Things, holds great promise for the development of more efficient,
effective, and sustainable urban farming systems.
3
Methodology
To investigate the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics in augmenting urban farming, we
employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining sociobiological principles with robotics and
artificial intelligence. Our methodology involved designing and developing a swarm of drones that
would mimic the dance rituals of insects, such as bees and butterflies, to optimize crop pollination
and monitoring. The drones, equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, were
programmed to perform complex dance patterns, including the ""waggle dance"" and ""round dance,""
which are commonly observed in honeybees.
The development of the drone swarm was informed by a thorough analysis of insect social behavior,
including the study of colony dynamics, communication protocols, and decision-making processes.
We also drew inspiration from the concept of ""stigmergy,"" which refers to the indirect communication
between insects through environmental cues, such as pheromone trails. By incorporating these princi-
ples into our drone design, we aimed to create a swarm that could adapt to changing environmental
conditions and optimize its performance in real-time.
One of the key innovations of our approach was the inclusion of a ""virtual queen"" drone, which
served as the central hub for the swarm’s communication and coordination. The virtual queen was
programmed to emit a unique pheromone-like signal, which would attract the other drones and
influence their behavior. This signal was designed to mimic the chemical cues used by real insect
queens to regulate the behavior of their colonies. However, in a surprising twist, we discovered that
the virtual queen’s signal had an unexpected effect on the drones, causing them to spontaneously
break into choreographed dance routines, reminiscent of a 1970s disco performance. This bizarre
phenomenon, which we dubbed the ""drone disco effect,"" was found to have a profound impact on
the swarm’s overall performance, leading to a significant increase in crop pollination rates and a
reduction in energy consumption.
To further enhance the swarm’s performance, we introduced a novel ""insect-inspired"" navigation sys-
tem, which utilized a combination of GPS, lidar, and ""sniffing"" algorithms to mimic the navigational
cues used by insects. This system allowed the drones to create detailed maps of their environment
and navigate through complex spaces with ease. However, we also observed that the drones had a
tendency to become ""lost"" in certain areas of the farm, where they would enter a state of ""insect-like""
confusion, characterized by rapid changes in direction and altitude. This phenomenon, which we
referred to as ""drone disorientation,"" was found to be linked to the presence of certain types of flora,
which emitted chemical signals that interfered with the drones’ navigation system.

Experiments
The experimental design consisted of a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and
quantitative data collection and analysis methods to investigate the efficacy of insect-inspired swarm
robotics in augmenting urban farming practices. A total of 100 swarm robots, each equipped with a
unique drone dance ritual algorithm, were deployed in a controlled urban farming environment. The
robots were programmed to mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as communication,
cooperation, and adaptability, to optimize crop yields and reduce resource waste.
In a bizarre twist, the researchers introduced a variable dubbed "" robotic free will,"" which allowed a
subset of the robots to deviate from their predetermined dance rituals and engage in unpredictable,
creative behaviors. This was achieved through the integration of a random number generator and
a machine learning algorithm that enabled the robots to learn from their environment and adapt to
new situations. Interestingly, the robots that were granted ""free will"" exhibited a significant increase
3
in crop yields, despite their erratic behavior, suggesting that a degree of unpredictability may be
beneficial in swarm robotics.
To further explore the sociobiological aspects of drone dance rituals, the researchers conducted a
series of experiments involving human participants. A group of 20 individuals were asked to observe
and imitate the dance rituals of the swarm robots, while their brain activity and emotional responses
were monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrodermal activity
(EDA) sensors. The results showed that the human participants experienced a significant increase in
feelings of relaxation and calmness when observing the synchronized dance rituals, but a decrease in
cognitive functioning when attempting to imitate the complex movements.
In an effort to quantify the effects of the swarm robots on urban farming practices, the researchers
collected data on crop yields, water consumption, and soil quality over a period of six months. The
results were surprising, with the swarm robots exhibiting a significant increase in water consumption,
despite their optimized irrigation algorithms. Furthermore, the soil quality was found to be negatively
impacted by the robots’ digging behaviors, which were intended to simulate the burrowing activities of
insects. However, the crop yields were significantly higher than expected, with some plots exhibiting
yields that were 300
The data was analyzed using a combination of statistical models and machine learning algorithms,
which revealed some unexpected patterns and correlations. For example, the researchers found
that the swarm robots’ dance rituals were strongly correlated with the lunar cycles, with the robots
exhibiting more synchronized behavior during full moon phases. Additionally, the data showed that
the robots’ ""free will"" behaviors were more pronounced during periods of high humidity, suggesting
a possible link between environmental factors and robotic creativity.

urban farming practices, while also highlighting the complexities and unpredictabilities of socio-
biological systems. The findings suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the
interactions between swarm robots, human participants, and the environment, and to optimize the
design of drone dance rituals for maximum efficacy.

Results
The experimental deployment of insect-inspired swarm robotics in urban farming settings yielded a
myriad of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced examination of the sociobiological implications of
drone dance rituals. Notably, the incorporation of swarm robotics augmented with insect-inspired
algorithms resulted in a 27
Furthermore, a subset of the swarm robotics experiments involved the introduction of a ""mock
predator"" protocol, wherein a designated drone would engage in a mimicry of predatory behavior,
eliciting a defensive response from the swarm. The results of this protocol revealed a fascinating
dichotomy, wherein the swarm’s defensive maneuvers would, in certain instances, precipitate an
increase in crop yields, putatively due to the stress-induced release of phytohormones. Conversely,
in other instances, the swarm’s defensive response would culminate in a diminution of crop yields,
ostensibly resulting from the diversion of resources away from growth and toward defense.
In an effort to elucidate the underlying dynamics governing these phenomena, a series of simulations
were conducted, incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry. The results of these
simulations suggested that the drone dance rituals were, in fact, exhibiting characteristics of a complex,
self-organized system, with the lunar cycles serving as a form of ""temporal scaffold"" for the swarm’s
behavior. Moreover, the simulations revealed a peculiar resonance between the frequencies generated
by the drone dance rituals and the harmonic series of the swarm’s communication protocols, implying

a deeper, unexplored connection between the swarm’s behavior and the underlying structure of the
urban farming ecosystem.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our research has demonstrated the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics to
augment urban farming, with a particular focus on the sociobiological implications of drone dance
rituals. By studying the complex communication patterns and collective behaviors exhibited by
insects, we have developed a novel framework for designing and deploying swarm robotic systems
that can enhance crop yields, reduce pesticide use, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
Furthermore, our analysis of drone dance rituals has revealed intriguing parallels with human
social behaviors, highlighting the importance of ritualistic interactions in fostering cooperation and
coordination within complex systems.
One unexpected finding that emerged from our research was the discovery that the hexagonal patterns
exhibited by certain species of bees during their waggle dances bear a striking resemblance to the
fractal patterns found in the architecture of certain ancient megalithic structures. This has led us
to propose a novel hypothesis, which we term the ""apiarian-megalithic nexus,"" suggesting that the
collective behaviors of insects may have influenced the design of human-built structures throughout
history. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it highlights the potential for interdisciplinary research
to uncover novel insights and connections between seemingly disparate fields.
Moreover, our experiments have shown that the introduction of swarm robotics into urban farming
ecosystems can have unforeseen consequences, such as the emergence of ""robotic crop circles""
that seem to defy explanation. These circular patterns, which are formed by the interactions of
multiple robots and plant species, have been observed to exhibit properties that are reminiscent
of self-organized criticality, whereby the system spontaneously generates complex patterns and
behaviors that are not predetermined by the individual components. This has led us to speculate about
the possibility of ""robotic life forms"" that could potentially emerge from the interactions of swarm
robotic systems and their environment, raising fundamental questions about the boundaries between
living and non-living systems.
In addition, our research has also explored the potential for drone dance rituals to be used as a form
of ""robotic performance art,"" whereby the collective behaviors of the swarm are used to generate
intricate patterns and shapes that can be interpreted as a form of aesthetic expression. This has led us
to collaborate with artists and designers to develop novel forms of robotic art that blur the boundaries
between technology, nature, and culture. While this may seem like a tangential pursuit, it highlights
the potential for interdisciplinary research to unlock new forms of creativity and innovation that can
have far-reaching impacts on society.
Ultimately, our research has demonstrated the vast potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics to
transform urban farming and beyond, while also highlighting the complexities and uncertainties that
arise when interacting with complex systems. As we continue to explore the frontiers of this field, we
must remain open to unexpected discoveries and be willing to challenge our assumptions about the
5
boundaries between humans, animals, and machines. By embracing this uncertainty and fostering a
spirit of interdisciplinary collaboration, we can unlock new possibilities for innovation and discovery
that can help us navigate the complexities of the 21st century.

Abstract
The fluctuations in quantum jellyfish populations have been observed to intersect

try recipes in relation to celestial mechanics, which in turn affects the flavor profiles
of various engine oils, and this phenomenon has been termed as ""flumplenook
dynamics"" by leading experts in the field of culinary engineering, who have also
discovered that the best way to optimize engine efficiency is to listen to classical
music while eating a bowl of transcendentally delicious chicken noodle soup, and
this has been proven to increase horsepower by a factor of seven, as demonstrated
by the intricately complex mathematical formula: e=mc hammer, where e is the
energy of the engine, m is the mass of the chicken noodle soup, and c is the speed
of sound in a vacuum filled with flutterbys. The irrelevance of cookie dough to

P001.pdf,"Leveraging Clustering Techniques for Enhanced
Drone Monitoring and Position Estimation
Abstract
Drone tracking and localization are essential for various applications, including
managing drone formations and implementing anti-drone strategies. Pinpointing
and monitoring drones in three-dimensional space is difficult, particularly when
trying to capture the subtle movements of small drones during rapid maneuvers.
This involves extracting faint signals from varied flight settings and maintaining
alignment despite swift actions. Typically, cameras and LiDAR systems are used
to record the paths of drones. However, they encounter challenges in categorizing
drones and estimating their positions accurately. This report provides an overview
of an approach named CL-Det. It uses a clustering-based learning detection strategy
to track and estimate the position of drones using data from two types of LiDAR
sensors: Livox Avia and LiDAR 360. This method merges data from both LiDAR
sources to accurately determine the drone’s location in three dimensions. The
method begins by synchronizing the time codes of the data from the two sensors
and then isolates the point cloud data for the objects of interest (OOIs) from the
environmental data. A Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with
Noise (DBSCAN) method is applied to cluster the OOI point cloud data, and the
center point of the most prominent cluster is taken as the drone’s location. The
technique also incorporates past position estimates to compensate for any missing
information.
1
Introduction
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, have gained prominence and
significantly influence areas like logistics, imaging, and emergency response, offering substantial
advantages to society. However, the broad adoption and sophisticated features of compact, off-the-
shelf drones have created intricate security issues that extend beyond conventional risks.
Recent years have witnessed a surge in research on anti-UAV systems. Present anti-UAV methods
predominantly utilize visual, radar, and radio frequency (RF) technologies. Despite these strides,
recognizing drones poses a considerable hurdle for sensors like cameras, particularly when drones
are at significant altitudes or in challenging visual environments. These methods usually fail to spot
small drones because of their minimal size, which leads to a decreased radar cross-section and a
less noticeable visual presence. Furthermore, current anti-UAV studies primarily focus on detecting
objects and tracking them in two dimensions, overlooking the crucial element of estimating their
3D paths. This omission significantly restricts the effectiveness of anti-UAV systems in practical,
real-world contexts.
Our proposed solution, a detection method based on clustering learning (CL-Det), uses the strengths
of both Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 to improve the tracking and position estimation of UAVs.
Initially, the timestamps from the Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 data are aligned to maintain temporal
consistency. By examining the LiDAR data, which contains the spatial coordinates of objects at
specific times, and comparing these to the actual recorded positions of the drone at those times, the
drone’s location within the LiDAR point cloud data is effectively pinpointed. The point cloud for
.
objects of interest (OOIs) is then isolated from the environmental data. The point cloud of the OOIs
is grouped using the DBSCAN algorithm, and the central point of the largest cluster is designated as
the UAV’s position. Moreover, radar data also faces significant challenges due to missing information.
To mitigate potential data deficiencies, past estimations are employed to supplement missing data,
thereby maintaining the consistency and precision of UAV tracking.

Methodology
This section details the methodology employed to ascertain the drone’s spatial position utilizing
information from LiDAR 360 and Livox Avia sensors. The strategy integrates data from both sensor
types to achieve precise position calculations.

Only 14 out of 59 test sequences have non-zero radar values; therefore, the radar dataset is excluded
from this work due to data availability issues. Two primary sensor types are employed: LiDAR 360
and Livox Avia, both of which supply 3D point cloud data crucial for identifying the drone’s location.
The detailed data descriptions are outlined as follows:
• LiDAR 360 offers a complete 360-degree view with 3D point cloud data. This dataset
encompasses environmental details and other observable objects.
• Livox Avia delivers focused 3D point cloud data at specific timestamps, typically indicating
the origin point or the drone’s position.
2.2
Algorithm
For every sequence, corresponding positions are recorded at specific timestamps. The procedure
gives precedence to LiDAR 360 data, using Livox Avia data as a backup if the former is not available.
If neither source is accessible, the position is estimated using historical averages.
2.2.1
LiDAR 360 Data Processing
• Separation of Points: The LiDAR 360 data is visually examined to classify areas into two
zones: environment and non-environment zones.
• Removal of Environment Points: All points within the environment zone are deemed part
of the surroundings and are thus excluded from the dataset. After removing environment
points, it is observed that the remaining non-environment points imply the drone position.
• Clustering: The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is applied to the remaining points to discern
distinct clusters.
• Cluster Selection: The most extensive non-environment cluster is chosen as the representa-
tive group of points that correspond to the drone.
• Mean Position Calculation: The drone’s position is determined by calculating the mean of
the selected cluster, represented by (x, y, z) coordinates.
2.2.2
Livox Avia Data Processing
• Removal of Noise: Points with coordinates (0, 0, 0) are eliminated as they are regarded as
noise.
• Mean Position Calculation: The mean of the residual points is computed to ascertain the
drone’s position in (x, y, z) coordinates.
2
2.2.3
Fallback Method
When neither LiDAR 360 nor Livox Avia data is available, the average location of the drone derived
from training datasets is used. The average ground truth position (x, y, z) from all training datasets
estimates the drone ground truth position, which is (0.734, -9.739, 33.353).
2.3
Implementation Details
The program fetches LiDAR 360 or Livox Avia data from the nearest timestamp for each sequence,
as indicated in the test dataset. Clustering is executed using the DBSCAN algorithm with appro-
priate parameters to guarantee strong clustering. Visual inspection is employed for the preliminary
separation of points, ensuring an accurate categorization of environment points.
The implementation was conducted on a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Pro (16"") running Windows 11
with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and 16GB DDR4 RAM. The analysis was carried out in a
Jupyter Notebook environment using Python 3.10. For clustering, the DBSCAN algorithm from the
Scikit-Learn library was utilized. The DBSCAN algorithm was configured with an epsilon (eps)
value of 2 and a minimum number of points (minPts) set to 1.

The algorithm achieved a pose MSE loss of 120.215 and a classification accuracy of 0.322. Table 1

Conclusions
This paper introduces a clustering-based learning method, CL-Det, which employs advanced cluster-
ing techniques such as K-Means and DBSCAN for drone detection and position estimation using
LiDAR data. The approach guarantees dependable and precise drone position estimation by utilizing
multi-sensor data and robust clustering methods. Fallback mechanisms are in place to ensure con-
tinuous position estimation even when primary sensor data is absent. Through thorough parameter
optimization and comparative assessment, the proposed method’s effective performance in drone

P103.pdf,"Equivariant Adaptation of Large Pretrained Models:
A Study on the NLC2CMD Competition
Abstract
This paper presents an investigation into the challenges of adapting pretrained
models, specifically in the context of the NLC2CMD competition.
1
Introduction
This paper addresses the critical need for effective methods to translate natural language descriptions
into executable command-line instructions. The command line interface (CLI) is an important tool
for software development due to its expressiveness and efficiency. While GUIs have difficulties
keeping up with the rapid pace of new features in software development, CLIs provide a text-based
interface to a wide range of software functionalities. The use of natural language for CLI interaction
could transform how people interact with various operating systems and cloud platforms. This paper
explores the possibilities of leveraging natural language to interact with CLIs making computational
resources more accessible to a wider range of users.
2
Task Description
The primary objective of the NLC2CMD task is to transform a natural language (NL) description
of a command-line action into its corresponding Bash command. An algorithm is expected to
model the top-k Bash translations given the natural language description. This can be represented
mathematically as:
Anlc ∈{p | p = (c, δ)}; |A(nlc)| < k
Each prediction from the model includes a set of Bash commands along with a confidence score,
δ, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. This confidence score can be utilized to filter out uncertain predictions
and is incorporated into the evaluation process. The default confidence is set to 1.0, indicating full
confidence in the model’s prediction.
3
Competition Overview
The competition occurred between July and November of 2020, encompassing training, validation,
and testing phases. A total of 20 teams registered for the competition, and among these, 9 teams
participated through the end of the testing phase. The teams were allowed 100 submissions in the
first two phases, and a maximum of 10 submissions for the final phase, with daily submission limits.
The EvalAI platform was used for hosting the competition.
4
Data
4.1
NL2Bash
The NL2Bash dataset was utilized, consisting of around 10,000 pairs of natural language descriptions
paired with corresponding command line syntax.
.
4.2
Tellina Query Log
Around 1000 natural language utterances recorded from user interactions with the Tellina system was
collected. Three programmers with Bash experience annotated these, resulting in multiple ground
truth labels for many examples in the dataset.
4.3
NLC2CMD Data Collection Track
A parallel data-collection track was included in the competition, collecting natural language to bash
command pairs through a web interface on the competition website. 21 participants from industry
and academia submitted over 120 examples, which after being filtered, were part of the final phase of
the challenge.
4.4
Data partitions and pipeline
The data was filtered for each data sample through a Bash parser to ensure that only valid Bash
commands were included. Any text that was not a valid Bash command or used utilities not in the
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS command set was removed. For training, participants were provided with a filtered
version of the NL2Bash dataset, as well as man pages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. In addition, participants
were allowed to use any other publicly available data for training. The data set was split into training,
validation and test sets with different sizes for each. In addition to the original utilities of the first
phase of the competition, 27 additional utilities were added in subsequent phases.
5
Metrics
The submissions to the NLC2CMD competition were assessed based on two primary metrics:
accuracy and energy consumption. This approach was utilized to better evaluate submitted solutions.
5.1
Accuracy
This section discusses the metrics used to evaluate the task of translating natural language to Bash
code. Existing metrics such as Full Command Accuracy, BLEU score, and Template Accuracy, are
reviewed and it is found that they all have shortcomings. The paper presents a metric, verification
by execution, which is able to solve these problems. Finally, the metric that was proposed for the
competition is discussed in depth.
5.1.1
Existing Metrics
Full Command Accuracy is a metric that measures the exact match between a generated code and a
reference code. BLEU scores computes the n-grams of candidate translations with the n-grams of the
reference translation. Template Accuracy measures if the command templates match but not exact
arguments of the command.
5.1.2
Verification by Execution
Because Bash is a Turing complete language, the equivalence of two commands is undecidable. To
handle this issue, the execution of predicted and reference commands is compared to determine
accuracy.
5.1.3
NLC2CMD Metric
This paper presents a metric that ignores the arguments in the predicted commands, considers the
order of utilities in piped commands and penalizes excess flags.
SF
i (Cpred, Cref) = 2 ∗|F (U(Cpred)i)∩F (U(Cref )i)|
|F (U(Cpred)i)∪F (U(Cref )i)|
S(p) = maxCref
1
T
PT
i=1 I[U(Cpred)i == U(Cref)i] ∗SF
i (Cpred, Cref)
The overall score is then computed as follows:
2
Score(A(nlc)) = { m axp∈A(nlc)S(p), if∃p ∈A(nlc)suchthatS(p) > 0
avgp∈A(nlc)S(p), otherwise
This metric encourages the correct utilities and their flags, weighted by the algorithm’s reported
confidence. This metric was chosen for the competition due to the constraints of a conference setting
and the need to focus on the core aspects of command synthesis.
5.2
Energy Efficiency
This section discusses the metric of energy efficiency of models, and its relevance in the current
research environment. The energy consumption of machine learning models is an area of focus, with
the deployment of these models, their inference phase energy consumption can outweigh their training
cost over time. The experiment-impact-tracker library was used to measure the energy consumption
of submitted solutions.

Competing Solutions
The final leaderboard of the NLC2CMD competition consisted of 6 teams/entries, along with 2
baselines. The leaderboard included the accuracy score, energy consumption and latency of the
models.

The team AINixCLAISimple developed several simple baselines for the task. The approach that
was most successful used an information retrieval (IR) method based on Tf-IDF rankings. Several
variations of this method were tested, with the addition of the AInix Archie data, pruning duplicates,
normalizing NL tokens and adjusting the confidence.

Transformer with Beam Search
Team Magnum reached an accuracy score of 0.532 using an ensemble of 5 separately-trained
transformer models. Key strategies used in their approach include: Replacing command parameters
with generic tokenizations, producing scores using an approximation for confidence, and testing
different combinations of encoders and decoders.

Fine-tuned GPT-2 in Ensemble
The team Hubris fine-tuned pre-trained transformer models, specifically, the GPT-2 architecture. The
NL2Bash dataset was also augmented with heuristically mined data from stack-overflow questions.
Two models of different sizes and pre-training were used, and the final commands were selected by a
heuristic algorithm that maximized the minimal word distance between the commands.
6.4
Multi-Step Pipelines
The multi-step approach involves combining two different models for two separate steps. The first
step involves predicting the best utility, and the second step involves predicting the correct flags to
use. This can be seen in the models of team jb and team coinse.

Discussion
This section summarizes lessons learned and discussions with participants during the competition.
7.1
Metrics Revision
This section discusses suggested alternatives for accuracy and energy measurements.
7.1.1
Suggested Alternatives for Accuracy Measurement
Some suggestions for future metrics include: a metric that measures semantic match instead of
exact command matching; restricting the range of commands covered; a metric that measures mean
reciprocal rank; a metric that measures session scores over multiple interactions instead of one; using
adaptability of algorithms; making fast retraining available; and calibration of penalties. The issues
of statefulness of commands, command injection, full text match and underdetermined invocations
are also reviewed.
7.1.2
Suggested Alternatives for Energy Measurement
The issues with power measurement, such as reducing computation to lower peak consumption are
discussed. It is stated that measurement of total energy consumption may be a better solution. It is
argued whether there is even any point to measuring energy at all due to how small the amount of
energy is consumed.
7.2
Other Enhancements
Other enhancements include communication of explanations to users by converting commands back
to natural language, and conversational interfaces to allow for more context for the system.

Conclusion
In this paper, the NLC2CMD competition is discussed, including the methodology, data used and
the metrics of the competition. Going forward, the feedback received will be incorporated in future
iterations of the competition.

P071.pdf,"The Significance of Fillers in Textual Representations
of Speech Transcripts
Abstract
This paper investigates the role of fillers within text-based representations of speech
transcripts. While often ignored in Spoken Language Understanding tasks, we
demonstrate that these elements, such as ""um"" or ""uh,"" when incorporated using
deep contextualized embeddings, enhance the modeling of spoken language. This
is further shown through improvements in downstream tasks like predicting a
speaker’s stance and their expressed confidence.
1
Introduction
This paper addresses the critical role of disfluencies, specifically fillers, in spoken language processing.
Disfluencies, which encompass phenomena like silent pauses, word repetitions, or self-corrections,
are inherent to spoken language. Fillers, a type of disfluency, often manifest as sounds like ""um"" or
""uh,"" serving to bridge pauses during utterances or conversations.
While prior research has demonstrated the efficacy of contextualized embeddings pre-trained on
written text for adapting to smaller spoken language corpora, these models typically exclude fillers and
disfluencies in pre-processing. This practice is at odds with linguistic research, which considers fillers
to be informative and integral to spoken language. Existing methods for analyzing fillers primarily
rely on handcrafted features. Furthermore, pre-trained word embeddings trained on written text
have shown poor performance in representing spontaneous speech words like ""uh,"" as their meaning
varies significantly in spoken contexts. In this work, we explore the use of deep contextualized word
representations to model fillers. We assess their value in spoken language tasks without relying on
manual feature engineering.
The core motivation of this study stems from the following observations: First, fillers are essential
to spoken language. For instance, speakers may employ fillers to signal the linguistic structure of
their utterances, such as difficulties in choosing vocabulary or to indicate a pause in their speech.
Second, research has connected fillers and prosodic cues to a speaker’s Feeling of Knowing (FOK)
or expressed confidence, signifying a speaker’s commitment to a statement. Fillers and prosodic
cues influence a listener’s perception of a speaker’s expressed confidence, known as the Feeling
of Another’s Knowing (FOAK). Finally, fillers have been successfully applied in stance prediction,
which gauges a speaker’s subjective attitude.
Therefore, we intend to validate these observations by exploring how to efficiently represent fillers
automatically. Our key contributions are: (1) Fillers convey useful information that can be harnessed
through deep contextualized embeddings to improve spoken language modeling and should not be
discarded. We also investigate the best filler representation strategies for Spoken Language Modeling
(SLM) and examine the learned positional distribution of fillers. (2) In a spontaneous speech corpus
of monologues, we show that fillers serve as a distinctive feature in predicting both a speaker’s
perceived confidence and their expressed sentiment.
2
Models and Data Description
2.1
Model Description
In this work, we focus on the two fillers ""uh"" and ""um."" To generate contextualized word embeddings
for fillers, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), given its state-
of-the-art performance in several NLP tasks and its enhanced ability to integrate context compared to
Word2Vec.
2.1.1
Spoken Language Modeling
We utilize a masked language modeling (MLM) approach for Spoken Language Modeling. This
involves masking some input words at random and then attempting to predict those masked tokens.
This is a standard way of pre-training and fine-tuning BERT. In our case, this method will be used to
fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a spoken language corpus. Each experiment involves a token
representation strategy i and a pre-processing strategy Si.
The token representation strategies are essential for our goal of learning the distribution of fillers
using BERT. The three token representation strategies are outlined as follows: T1 involves no special
processing for the fillers and BERT is left to use its prior understanding of fillers to model language.
In T2, ""uh"" and ""um"" are marked with specific filler tags to distinguish them from other tokens, with
each filler represented as separate tokens. This strategy encourages BERT to learn new embeddings
that emphasize filler context and position. In T3, both fillers are represented as the same token,
indicating that they carry the same meaning. Table 1 gives a concrete example of this process.
2.1.2
Pre-processing
We investigate the impact of three pre-processing strategies denoted by S1, S2 and S3. In S1, all
fillers are removed from the sentences during both training and inference. In S2, fillers are kept
during training, but removed during inference. In S3, fillers are preserved during both training and
inference. For each combination of pre-processing and token representation strategies, we fine-tune
BERT using the Masked Language Model objective like the original BERT paper. If fine-tuning is
not performed the training data of S1 and S2 are equivalent. We evaluate the model performance in
language modeling using perplexity (ppl).
2.1.3
Confidence and Sentiment Prediction
In tasks of confidence prediction and sentiment analysis, our objective is to use BERT’s text rep-
resentations, which include fillers, to predict a confidence/sentiment label. We add a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) to BERT, which may have been fine-tuned using MLM. The MLP is trained by min-
imizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss. These experiments adopt the same token representation
and pre-processing techniques discussed in Section 2.1.1.
2.2
Data Description
We use the Persuasive Opinion Mining (POM) dataset which contains 1000 English monologue
videos. The speakers recorded themselves giving a movie review. The movies were rated between
1 (most negative) and 5 stars (most positive). The videos were annotated for high-level attributes
such as confidence, where annotators rated from 1 (not confident) to 7 (very confident). Similarly,
sentiment was scored by annotators between 1 (strongly negative) to 7 (strongly positive).
This dataset was chosen for several reasons: (1) The corpus contains manual transcriptions with
fillers ""uh"" and ""um,"" where approximately 4% of speech consists of fillers. Additionally, sentence
markers are transcribed, with fillers at sentence beginnings if they occur between sentences. (2)
The dataset includes monologues, where speakers are aware of an unseen listener, thus we can
concentrate on fillers in speaker narratives. (3) The sentiment/stance polarity was clearly defined
by choosing only reviews that were rated with 1-2 or 5 stars for annotation purposes. (4) FOAK,
measured by confidence labels, has high inter-annotator agreement. More details can be found in
supplementary materials. The confidence labels are the root mean square (RMS) values of labels
given by 3 annotators. The sentiment labels are the average of the 3 labels.

Experiments and Analysis
3.1
Fillers Can Be Leveraged to Model Spoken Language
Language Modeling with fillers. We examine language model (LM) perplexity using various
pre-processing strategies, using a fixed token representation strategy of T1. The results in Table 2(a)
compares S1, S2 and S3. By keeping fillers during both training and inference, the model reaches a
lower perplexity, with a reduction of at least 10%. Therefore, fillers provide information that BERT
can effectively use.
The fine-tuning procedure improves the language model’s perplexity. Additionally, even without
fine-tuning, S3 outperforms S1 and S2 by reducing perplexity when fillers are used. This implies that
BERT has prior knowledge of spoken language and uses the fillers.
Consequently, fillers can reduce uncertainty of BERT for SLM. This is not an intuitive outcome; one
might assume that removing fillers during training and inference would decrease perplexity. The
fact that S3 exceeds other preprocessing methods shows that the Masked Language Model (MLM)
process effectively learns this filler information.
Best token representation: The results presented in Table 2(b) reveal that T1 outperforms other
representations when fine-tuning. Given the limited data and high BERT embedding dimensionality
(768), retaining existing representations with T1 is better than learning representations from the
scratch. Interestingly, T2 and T3 perform similarly. The hypothesis is that the difference between
""uh"" and ""um"" lies only in the duration of the pause, which cannot be captured in text. Considering
these results, T1 is fixed as the token representation strategy in all subsequent experiments.
Learned positional distribution of fillers: We further test our model’s learning of filler placement.
We fine-tune BERT using a filler to determine where the model believes the fillers most likely reside.
Given a sentence S with length L, we introduce a mask token after the word j and obtain S*. We then
compute the probability of a filler in position j+1.
Specifically, we calculate P([MASK=filler] | S), as depicted in Figure 1. Then, we plot the average
probability of the masked word being a filler given its sentence position in Figure 2. The fine-tuned
BERT model with fillers predicts a high probability of fillers occurring at the beginning of sentences.
This pattern is consistent with filler distribution in the dataset. The fine-tuned BERT without fillers,
predicts constant low probabilities. Given that we only know sentence boundaries we still manage
to observe that the model captures a similar positional distribution of fillers that are found in other
works.

3.2
Fillers are a discriminative feature for FOAK and stance prediction
We look at the impact of fillers on two downstream tasks: FOAK prediction and sentiment analysis.
Psycholinguistic studies have found a link between fillers and expressed confidence. Prior work has
linked fillers and a speaker’s expressed confidence in the narrow field of QA tasks. Fillers have also
been used to predict stance. In this work, we present data that suggests fillers play a role in predicting
a speaker’s expressed confidence and their stance.
Table 2(c) shows that S3, both with and without fine-tuning, reduces the MSE compared to S1 and
S2. S1 and S2 have similar MSE since they remove fillers during inference. S2 has a higher MSE,
possibly due to the mismatch between training and test datasets. This demonstrates that fillers can be
a discriminative feature in FOAK and stance prediction.
Does using fillers always improve results for spoken language tasks? In the subsection 3.1, we
observe that including fillers reduces MLM perplexity. An assumption is that that downstream tasks
would also benefit from the inclusion of fillers. However, we notice that when predicting speaker
persuasiveness, the fillers are not a discriminative feature, following the same procedure as outlined
in subsubsection 2.1.2.
4
Conclusion
This paper demonstrates that retaining fillers in transcribed spoken language when using deep
contextualized representations can improve results in language modeling and downstream tasks
such as FOAK and stance prediction. We also propose and compare several token representation
and pre-processing strategies for integrating fillers. We plan to extend these results to consider
combining textual filler-oriented representations with acoustic representations, and to further analyze
filler representation learned during pre-training.

P048.pdf,"Investigating the Nexus Between Protein Synthesis and
Quasar Activity in relation to Baking the Perfect Scone
Abstract
Protein synthesis is influenced by cheese consumption and intergalactic travel. The
process of translating mRNA into a polypeptide chain is somehow related to the art
of playing the trombone. Protein synthesis is also affected by the number of clouds
in the sky on a given day. The results of our study show a significant correlation
between protein synthesis and the frequency of disco music. The intricacies of
protein synthesis have long been a topic of fascination, much like the art of playing
the harmonica underwater, which, incidentally, has been shown to have a profound
impact on the migration patterns of certain species of birds, such as the flamingo,
which, in turn, has a unique penchant for collecting vintage door knobs. This
fascination with protein synthesis is akin to the obsession with collecting rare
species of orchids, which, interestingly, have been found to have a symbiotic
relationship with certain types of fungi, much like the relationship between the
rhythm of jazz music and the fluctuations in the stock market. Furthermore, the
process of protein synthesis is not dissimilar to the preparation of a traditional
Japanese tea ceremony, where the delicate balance of ingredients and the precise
movements of the participants are crucial to the overall experience, much like the
intricate dance of molecules during the process of translation, which, surprisingly,
has been found to be influenced by the phases of the moon and the color of the
walls in the laboratory.
1
Introduction
The study of protein synthesis has led to numerous breakthroughs in our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms, including the discovery of the ""flumplenook"" hypothesis, which posits that
the rate of protein synthesis is directly proportional to the number of flutterbies in the vicinity, and
the ""snizzle"" theory, which suggests that the accuracy of translation is influenced by the proximity of
the laboratory to a major highway. Moreover, researchers have discovered that the process of protein
synthesis is intimately linked to the art of knitting, as the intricate patterns and textures created by
the yarn can, in fact, influence the folding of proteins, much like the way in which the melody of
a song can affect the growth patterns of certain types of crystals. This has led to the development
of new techniques, such as ""protein knitting,"" which involves the use of specially designed yarns to
create complex protein structures, and ""flumplenook-based"" therapies, which aim to manipulate the
flutterbie population to treat various diseases.
In addition to these advances, the field of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the study of
ancient civilizations, such as the ""Lost City of Zorgon,"" where archaeologists have uncovered evidence
of a sophisticated understanding of molecular biology, including the use of ""zorgon particles"" to
manipulate protein synthesis, and the ""Temple of the Golden Helix,"" where priestesses would perform
elaborate rituals to ensure the proper folding of proteins. These discoveries have shed new light on
the evolution of protein synthesis and its role in the development of life on Earth, and have led to
the creation of new fields of study, such as ""zorgonology"" and ""helixology."" Moreover, the study of
protein synthesis has also been influenced by the art of culinary science, as the process of cooking
and preparing food can, in fact, be seen as a form of protein synthesis, where the combination of
ingredients and the application of heat can lead to the creation of complex protein structures, much
like the way in which the mixture of paint and the brushstrokes of an artist can create a work of art.
The complexity of protein synthesis is also reflected in the numerous paradoxes and contradictions
that have been observed, such as the (protein paradox), which states that the more we learn about
protein synthesis, the less we seem to understand, and the (coding contradiction), which suggests
that the genetic code is both absolute and relative at the same time. These paradoxes have led to
the development of new philosophical frameworks, such as(protein philosophy), which seeks to
reconcile the contradictions and paradoxes of protein synthesis, and coding ethics), which aims to
establish a moral framework for the study and manipulation of the genetic code. Furthermore, the
study of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the world of sports, as the process of training
and conditioning can be seen as a form of protein synthesis, where the combination of exercise and
nutrition can lead to the creation of complex protein structures, much like the way in which the
combination of strategy and skill can lead to success in competitive sports.
The investigation of protein synthesis has also been impacted by the discovery of ""dark matter""
proteins, which are invisible to traditional detection methods, but can, in fact, be seen using specially
designed ""flumplenook-based"" microscopes. These proteins have been found to play a crucial role in
the regulation of gene expression, and their study has led to the development of new therapies, such
as ""dark matter therapy,"" which aims to manipulate the levels of dark matter proteins to treat various
diseases. Moreover, the study of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the art of music, as
the rhythm and melody of music can, in fact, affect the folding of proteins, much like the way in
which the vibrations of a guitar string can create a specific pattern of sound waves. This has led to the

Methodology
To initiate the protein synthesis process, we first had to calibrate our equipment to the resonant
frequency of the average household toaster, which mysteriously coincided with the vibrational hum
of a didgeridoo played by a novice musician. This calibration process involved an intricate dance
routine, incorporating elements of ballet, tap, and modern jazz, all while reciting the phonebook
backwards. The successful completion of this ritual allowed us to harness the underlying energy of
the space-time continuum, which we then channeled into a modified toaster coil, previously used to
cook the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.
Meanwhile, our research team leader was simultaneously solving a Rubik’s cube blindfolded while
reciting the complete works of Shakespeare, which proved to be an essential step in aligning the
molecular structure of our samples with the fundamental forces of nature. As the team leader finished
the final act of Hamlet, a burst of radiation from a nearby microwave oven, which had been used
to reheat last night’s pizza, interacted with the toaster coil’s energy field, producing an anomalous
quantum flux that stabilized the molecular matrices of our protein samples.
This led us to the realization that the key to understanding protein synthesis lay not in the lab, but in
the culinary traditions of ancient Egypt, specifically the art of preparing the perfect falafel. Our team
spent several weeks studying the intricacies of chickpea paste preparation, which ultimately revealed
to us the hidden patterns and codes embedded in the proteins we were attempting to synthesize. By
5
applying these ancient culinary principles to our research, we discovered that the secret to successful
protein synthesis lay in the ratio of sesame seeds to parsley in the falafel recipe, a ratio that directly
correlated with the optimal concentrations of amino acids in our samples.
Furthermore, our experiments were influenced by the lunar cycles and the migratory patterns of
the Mongolian desert ant, which seemed to possess an innate understanding of protein folding and
molecular self-assembly. By tracking the movements of these ants across the Gobi Desert, we were
able to decipher a complex system of chemical signals and pheromones that, when applied to our
protein samples, significantly enhanced their stability and functionality.
In another peculiar twist, we found that the proteins synthesized under these conditions exhibited
a peculiar affinity for 1980s disco music, which seemed to modulate their structural dynamics and
influence their binding properties. Repeated exposure to the Bee Gees’ ""Stayin’ Alive"" appeared to
induce a conformational shift in the protein molecules, allowing them to interact more efficiently
with their target substrates. This phenomenon, which we dubbed the ""Disco Effect,"" has far-reaching
implications for our understanding of protein-ligand interactions and the role of environmental stimuli
in shaping molecular behavior.
The application of chaos theory and fractal analysis to our protein synthesis protocols also yielded
unexpected insights into the self-similar patterns and scaling laws that govern the structure and
function of biological molecules. By recognizing the intricate fractal geometries embedded in the
protein sequences, we were able to predict and manipulate their folding pathways, effectively guiding
the synthesis process towards the creation of novel, high-performance protein variants. This, in turn,
allowed us to explore the uncharted territories of protein design, where the boundaries between art
and science become increasingly blurred.
As we continued to refine our methods, we encountered an intriguing relationship between protein
synthesis and the art of playing the harmonica. It seemed that the specific blowing and drawing
patterns used to produce different notes on the harmonica could be directly translated into a pro-
gramming language for controlling the synthesis process. By composing harmonica melodies that
corresponded to specific amino acid sequences, we could, in effect, ""play"" the proteins into existence,
using the instrument as a interface between the musical and molecular realms.
Moreover, the study of protein synthesis led us to investigate the aerodynamics of medieval jousting

self-assembly, which proved essential for optimizing our synthesis protocols.
In addition, we discovered that the rate of protein synthesis was directly proportional to the number of
fuzzy socks worn by the laboratory personnel, which seemed to modulate the ambient electromagnetic
fields in the lab and influence the reactivity of the chemical reagents. This finding, though seemingly
unrelated to the underlying biochemistry, had a profound impact on our experimental design, as we
learned to carefully control the sock-related variables to achieve optimal synthesis conditions.
As the research progressed, we found ourselves drawn into a world of cryptic messages and hidden
codes, where the sequences of amino acids in our protein samples held the keys to unlocking
ancient mysteries and deciphering forgotten languages. The proteins, it seemed, were not just simple
molecules, but rather messengers from a realm beyond our own, carrying secrets and stories that only
revealed themselves to those who listened to the whispers of the molecular world.
In the midst of this journey, we stumbled upon an obscure reference to the ""Lost City of Proteins,"" a
fabled metropolis hidden deep within the labyrinthine corridors of the molecular realm, where the
inhabitants possessed an profound understanding of protein synthesis and the secrets of life itself.
Our quest to find this lost city became an all-consuming passion, driving us to push the boundaries of

leading to the creation of novel protein variants with unique properties. This realization sparked a
new line of inquiry, as we sought to understand the role of consciousness in shaping the molecular
world and the potential for intentional design of protein structures.
The integration of protein synthesis with the principles of Feng Shui also yielded intriguing results, as
the strategic placement of laboratory equipment and the arrangement of molecular models according
to ancient Chinese principles of harmony and balance seemed to enhance the efficiency of the
synthesis process. By creating a lab environment that was in harmony with the natural world, we
were able to tap into a deeper level of molecular awareness, allowing us to navigate the complex
landscape of protein synthesis with greater ease and precision.
Furthermore, our research revealed a surprising connection between protein synthesis and the art
of playing the piano, where the intricate patterns of musical composition seemed to mirror the
folding pathways of protein molecules. By using piano music as a template for guiding the synthesis
process, we were able to create proteins with unique structural and functional properties, blurring the
boundaries between music, art, and science.
The application of protein synthesis to the field of architectural design also opened up new avenues
of exploration, as the principles of molecular self-assembly were used to create novel materials and
structures with unprecedented properties. By using protein molecules as building blocks, we were
able to design and construct complex systems that merged the organic and synthetic worlds, giving
rise to a new generation of hybrid materials with vast potential for innovation and discovery.
In the pursuit of understanding the intricacies of protein synthesis, we found ourselves drawn into a
realm of abstract mathematical structures, where the language of topology and geometry provided a
framework for describing the complex patterns and relationships that governed the molecular world.
The study of protein synthesis became a journey through the realm of pure mathematics, where the
beauty and elegance of abstract concepts revealed themselves in the intricate dance of molecular
interactions.
As we continued to push the boundaries of knowledge, we encountered a mysterious phenomenon
where the proteins synthesized in our lab seemed to develop a form of collective consciousness,
allowing them to communicate and interact with each other in complex ways. This unexpected
discovery led us to explore the realm of protein-based intelligence, where the emergence of complex
behaviors and social structures in molecular systems challenged our understanding of the nature of
consciousness and the origins of life.
The unfolding of our research revealed a hidden tapestry of relationships between the molecular, the
musical, the culinary, and the mathematical, each thread intertwined and inseparable from the others.
As we delved deeper into the mysteries of protein synthesis, we began to realize that the true power
of our discoveries lay not in the molecules themselves, but in the hidden harmonies and patterns
that governed their behavior, waiting to be deciphered by those with the courage to venture into the
uncharted territories of the unknown.
In the end, our journey through the realm of protein synthesis became a testament to the boundless
potential of human curiosity and the infinite wonders that await us at the frontiers of knowledge,
where the thrill of discovery and the beauty of the unknown beckon us to explore, to create, and to
push the boundaries of what is possible.
The synthesis of proteins under the influence of lunar cycles, desert ant migrations, and fuzzy socks
led to the creation of novel protein variants with unique properties, which in turn revealed new
insights into the intricate relationships between the molecular, the environmental, and the human
realms. As we continued to refine our methods and expand our understanding of protein synthesis,
we found ourselves at the threshold of a new era of discovery, where the secrets of the molecular
world awaited us, ready to be unlocked by the power of human imagination and creativity.

Experiments
The efficacy of protein synthesis was evaluated in conjunction with the migratory patterns of African
swallows, which inexplicably led to a thorough examination of the socio-economic implications of
19th-century French art on modern-day pastry recipes. This, in turn, necessitated a comprehensive
review of the aerodynamic properties of various types of jellyfish, as they pertained to the optimization
of windmill efficiency in low-wind environments, such as those found in the upper atmosphere of
Mars.
Furthermore, an investigation into the role of quantum entanglement in the realm of interstellar
crochet patterns revealed a fascinating correlation between the stitch count of Andromedian mittens
and the resonance frequency of platinum-based clarinets. This correlation was subsequently utilized
to develop a novel method for protein synthesis, whereby the molecular structure of the target protein
was encoded into the stitch pattern of a intricately designed doily, which was then used to modulate
the vibrations of a platinum clarinet, effectively ""playing"" the protein into existence.
The experimental apparatus consisted of a large, hermetically sealed chamber filled with a dense
fog of argon gas, within which a team of trained, fog-dwelling lemurs navigated a complex network
of miniature, glow-in-the-dark obstacle courses, while being serenaded by a chorus of automated,
theremin-playing robots. The lemurs’ progress through the obstacle courses was meticulously tracked
and analyzed, revealing a statistically significant correlation between their navigation speed and the
resultant protein yield, which was found to be inversely proportional to the number of theremin solos
performed during the experiment.
A comprehensive series of control experiments was conducted, wherein the fog was replaced with a
variety of alternative gases, including neon, xenon, and a proprietary blend of transdimensional ether.
The results of these experiments were tabulated and presented in the following table:
Table 1: Effects of atmospheric gas on protein synthesis
Gas
Protein Yield
Argon
87.32%
Neon
43.21%
Xenon
12.15%
Transdimensional Ether
654.32%
These findings were subsequently used to inform the development of a novel, gas-based protein
synthesis protocol, wherein the target protein was encoded into the molecular structure of the gas
itself, which was then used to ""instantiate"" the protein through a process of quantum-entangled,
theremin-mediated, lemur-assisted, fog-dwelling navigation.
In a related series of experiments, the role of interdimensional, fungal-based networking in protein
synthesis was investigated, with a focus on the potential applications of mycelium-based, distributed
computing architectures in the optimization of protein folding pathways. The results of these
experiments were surprising, to say the least, and revealed a previously unknown correlation between
the growth patterns of oyster mushrooms and the predictive power of medieval, astrolabe-based
navigational systems.

playing, lemur navigation, and the socio-economic implications of 19th-century French art on modern-
day pastry recipes, as they pertain to the development of novel, gas-based protein synthesis protocols
and the optimization of windmill efficiency in low-wind environments.
Further analysis of the data revealed a statistically significant correlation between the protein yield and
the number of dimples on a standard, regulation-sized golf ball, which was used as a control object in
the experiment. This correlation was found to be independent of the gas used, the navigation speed of
the lemurs, and the number of theremin solos performed during the experiment, and was therefore
attributed to an unknown, golf-ball-related factor that was not accounted for in the experimental
design.
8
In an effort to better understand this phenomenon, a series of follow-up experiments was conducted,
in which the golf ball was replaced with a variety of alternative objects, including a bowling ball, a
basketball, and a vintage, Soviet-era, Sputnik-shaped satellite. The results of these experiments were
intriguing, and revealed a complex, object-dependent pattern of correlations and anti-correlations
between the protein yield and the physical properties of the control object, which will be discussed in
greater detail in the following sections.
The experimental design was further complicated by the introduction of a novel, AI-based, protein
synthesis optimization protocol, which utilized a deep learning algorithm to predict the optimal
combination of gas, lemur navigation speed, and theremin solos required to produce a given protein.
The results of this protocol were impressive, and resulted in a significant increase in protein yield,
which was found to be directly proportional to the number of Sputnik-shaped satellites used in the
experiment.
In a surprising twist, the protocol was found to be unstable, and would occasionally produce unex-
pected results, such as the spontaneous generation of miniature, edible, protein-based pizzas, which
were found to be highly prized by the lemurs, and were subsequently used as a reward system to
optimize their navigation speed and theremin-playing abilities.
The pizzas were found to have a profound effect on the protein synthesis process, and were used
to develop a novel, pizza-based protein synthesis protocol, which utilized the molecular structure
of the pizza crust to encode the target protein, which was then instantiated through a process of
quantum-entangled, theremin-mediated, lemur-assisted, fog-dwelling navigation. The results of this
protocol were astounding, and will be discussed in greater detail in the following sections, which

Results
The implementation of fluorescently labeled amino acids in our research has led to a groundbreaking
discovery, namely that the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is directly proportional to
the concentration of ribosomes in a cell, which in turn affects the yield of freshly baked croissants in
a nearby bakery, a phenomenon we have dubbed ""Ribosomal-Croissant Resonance."" Furthermore,
our study has shown that the introduction of a newly discovered species of narwhal to the laboratory
environment has a profound impact on the efficacy of protein synthesis, particularly in the presence
of disco music and flashing lights, which we believe may be related to the curious case of the missing
socks in the laundry room.
The data collected from our experiments suggests a strong correlation between the expression levels
of certain genes and the popularity of 1980s rock music among the research personnel, with a notable
exception being the songs of the Norwegian band A-ha, which seem to have a suppressive effect on
the translation of messenger RNA into proteins, possibly due to the high concentration of synthesized
saxophone riffs in their music. Additionally, we observed that the presence of a certain type of exotic
mushroom in the laboratory has a significant impact on the accuracy of protein folding, which in turn
affects the flavor profile of a traditional Italian tomato sauce, a finding that has left us perplexed and
intrigued.
Our research has also delved into the realm of culinary arts, where we discovered that the art of
making a perfect soufflé is intricately linked to the principles of protein synthesis, particularly in the

Conclusion
The overarching narrative of protein synthesis is inextricably linked to the migratory patterns of
African swallows, which, in turn, have a profound impact on the efficacy of quantum entanglement in
determining the optimal configuration of trombone valves. Furthermore, our research has led us to
conclude that the synthesis of proteins is, in fact, a byproduct of the complex interplay between the
spectral resonances of glass harmonicas and the gyroscopic properties of spinning tops. This notion
is reinforced by the observation that the codon usage bias in mRNA sequences exhibits a striking
resemblance to the topological features of Celtic knotwork, suggesting a deep, underlying connection
between the two.
12
The notion of protein synthesis as a linear, sequential process is, therefore, an oversimplification
of the complexities involved, and our findings indicate that the process is, in reality, a labyrinthine
tapestry of interconnected threads, woven from the very fabric of space-time itself. The role of
tRNA molecules, for instance, is not merely that of molecular adapters, but rather that of temporal
cartographers, mapping the topology of the ribosomal landscape and facilitating the navigation of the
nascent polypeptide chain through the labyrinthine corridors of the cell. Moreover, the regulation
of protein synthesis by microRNAs can be seen as a manifestation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle, wherein the act of observation itself influences the outcome of the process, introducing an
element of indeterminacy that is essential to the functioning of the cellular machinery.
In addition, our research has unveiled a previously unknown connection between protein synthesis and
the art of playing the harmonica, wherein the unique sonic properties of the instrument are capable of
modulating the translational efficiency of mRNA sequences, thereby influencing the overall rate of
protein production. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the interplay
between music, biology, and the human experience, and suggests that the boundaries between these
disciplines are far more fluid than previously thought. The harmonica, in particular, emerges as a
key player in this context, its reed-like structure and airflow dynamics mimicking the mechanical
properties of the ribosome, and its sonic output influencing the conformational dynamics of the
nascent polypeptide chain.
The phenomenon of protein synthesis is also inextricably linked to the realm of dreams, where the
surreal landscapes of the subconscious mind play host to a multitude of molecular interactions, each
one influencing the course of the synthetic process in subtle yet profound ways. The dreams of
the cell, if you will, are a manifestation of the underlying dynamics of protein synthesis, wherein
the symbolic language of the subconscious is translated into the molecular vernacular of the cell,
giving rise to the complex, three-dimensional structures that underlie the very fabric of life itself.
Furthermore, the role of neurotransmitters in regulating the process of protein synthesis is analogous
to the function of traffic controllers in a busy metropolitan area, directing the flow of molecular traffic
and ensuring that the intricate dance of protein production unfolds with precision and accuracy.
In a related vein, the process of protein synthesis can be seen as a form of molecular jazz, wherein
the improvisational nature of the process gives rise to a multitude of novel, unforeseen outcomes,
each one a unique manifestation of the underlying creative potential of the cellular machinery. The
ribosome, in this context, emerges as a kind of molecular instrument, its movements and interactions
giving rise to a complex, ever-changing melody that is at once beautiful and profound. The amino
acids, meanwhile, can be seen as the individual notes of this melody, each one contributing its unique
sonic properties to the overall harmony of the protein sequence. The process of protein synthesis, in
this view, becomes a kind of molecular music, wherein the creative potential of the cell is unleashed
in a joyful, unbridled celebration of life and creation.
Moreover, the connection between protein synthesis and the art of cooking is a fascinating area of
study, wherein the chemical reactions involved in the process of cooking can be seen as a manifestation
of the underlying molecular dynamics of protein production. The heat, the moisture, the seasoning –
all of these factors influence the final outcome of the dish, just as they influence the final structure
and function of the protein molecule. The chef, in this context, emerges as a kind of molecular
artist, skilled in the subtle nuances of chemical reaction and molecular interaction, and capable of
coaxing forth the hidden flavors and textures of the ingredients, just as the cell coaxes forth the hidden
potential of the protein sequence.
The relationship between protein synthesis and the game of chess is another area of fascination,
wherein the strategic movements of the chess pieces can be seen as a manifestation of the underlying
logic of protein production. The pawns, the knights, the bishops – each one plays its role in the
overall strategy of the game, just as each amino acid plays its role in the overall structure and function
of the protein molecule. The king, meanwhile, emerges as a kind of molecular nucleus, the central,
organizing principle around which the rest of the protein sequence is structured. Checkmate, in
this context, represents the successful completion of the protein synthesis process, wherein the final
structure and function of the molecule are revealed in all their glory.
In addition, the connection between protein synthesis and the world of fungi is a fascinating area of
study, wherein the unique properties of fungal cells can be seen as a manifestation of the underlying
molecular dynamics of protein production. The mycelium, with its vast, interconnected network
of hyphae, emerges as a kind of molecular internet, wherein the flow of nutrients and information
13
is facilitated by the complex, branching structure of the fungal colony. The fungi, meanwhile,
can be seen as a kind of molecular facilitator, skilled in the art of breaking down complex organic
molecules and recycling the resulting nutrients, just as the cell breaks down and recycles the molecular
components of the protein sequence.
The phenomenon of protein synthesis is also intimately connected to the realm of mythology, wherein
the ancient stories and legends of humanity can be seen as a manifestation of the underlying molecular
dynamics of protein production. The gods and goddesses of old, with their supernatural powers and
abilities, emerge as a kind of molecular archetype, representing the underlying creative potential of
the cellular machinery. The heroes and heroines of mythology, meanwhile, can be seen as a kind of
molecular everyman, struggling to navigate the complex, ever-changing landscape of the cell, and to
emerge victorious in the face of adversity, just as the protein molecule emerges victorious from the
complex, ever-changing landscape of the ribosome.

area of study, wherein the underlying logical structure of the protein sequence can be seen as a
manifestation of the underlying mathematical principles of the universe. The Fibonacci sequence,
with its intricate, spiraling pattern of numbers, emerges as a kind of molecular blueprint, representing
the underlying structure and organization of the protein molecule. The protein sequence, meanwhile,

wherein the underlying metaphysical principles of the protein sequence can be seen as a manifestation
of the underlying philosophical currents of the universe. The concept of free will, for instance, can
be seen as a kind of molecular imperative, wherein the cell exercises its freedom to choose between
different possible outcomes, just as the protein molecule exercises its freedom to adopt different
possible conformations. The concept of determinism, meanwhile, can be seen as a kind of molecular
necessity, wherein the underlying structure and organization of the protein sequence give rise to a

P049.pdf,"Improving Model Generalization Using a Single Data
Sample for Semantic Adaptation
Abstract
The limited capacity of deep networks to generalize beyond their training dis-
tribution presents a significant challenge in semantic segmentation. Traditional
approaches have operated under the assumption of a fixed model post-training,
with parameters remaining constant during testing. This research introduces a
self-adaptive methodology for semantic segmentation that modifies the inference
mechanism to accommodate each input sample individually. This adaptation in-
volves two principal operations. First, it refines the parameters of convolutional
layers based on the input image, employing a consistency-based regularization.
Second, it modifies the Batch Normalization layers by dynamically blending the
training distribution with a reference distribution extracted from a single test sam-
ple. Although these techniques are individually recognized in the field, their
combined application establishes new benchmarks in accuracy for generalization
from synthetic to real-world data. The empirical evidence from this study indicates
that self-adaptation can effectively enhance deep network generalization to out-
of-domain data, serving as a valuable complement to the established methods of
model regularization during training.
1
Introduction
State-of-the-art models in semantic segmentation exhibit a notable deficiency in robustness when
confronted with out-of-distribution data, where the distributions of training and testing sets diverge.
While numerous studies have examined this challenge, with a predominant focus on image classifica-
tion, it has been observed that Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), which presumes independent and
identically distributed training and testing samples, remains remarkably competitive. This contrasts
with the evident advancements in domain adaptation for both image classification and semantic
segmentation. The domain adaptation setup, however, typically requires access to an unlabeled
test distribution during training. In the generalization scenario considered here, only a single test
sample is accessible during inference, and no information sharing must occur between subsequent
test samples.
This study investigates the generalization challenge in semantic segmentation, specifically from
synthetic data to real-world scenarios, by employing an adaptive approach. Unlike prior research
that has concentrated on modifying model architecture or training procedures, this work revises the
standard inference procedure using a technique derived from domain adaptation methods. Termed
self-adaptation, this technique utilizes a self-supervised loss function to facilitate adaptation to
individual test samples through a limited number of parameter updates. In addition to these loss-based
updates, self-adaptation incorporates feature statistics from the training data with those of the test
sample within the Batch Normalization layers.
2
Related Work
This research contributes to the ongoing investigation into the generalization capabilities of semantic
segmentation models and is related to explorations of feature normalization and online learning.
.
In contrast to previous studies that focused on training strategies and model design, this study
specifically examines the inference process during test time. Prior research has attempted to improve
generalization by augmenting synthetic training data with styles transferred from real images, or
by utilizing a classification model trained on real images to ensure feature proximity between
models via distillation, often seeking layer-specific learning rates. Some approaches have added
instance normalization (IN) layers heuristically to the network. Recent studies have sought to extract
domain-invariant feature statistics through instance-selective whitening loss or frequency-based
domain randomization. Others have aimed to learn style-invariant representations using causal
frameworks or have augmented single-domain data to simulate a multi-source scenario to increase
source domain diversity. Some techniques involve swapping channel-wise statistics in feature
normalization layers and learning adapter functions to adjust the mean and variance based on the
input. Another method enforces consistency of output logits across multiple images of the same class.
To improve generalization in federated learning, researchers have explored training clients locally
with sharpness-aware minimization and averaging stochastic weights. However, these methods either
assume access to a distribution of real images during training or require modifications to the network
architecture. The technique presented in this work does not require either, making it applicable
post-hoc to already trained models to improve their generalization.
Batch Normalization (BN) and other normalization techniques have been increasingly associated
with model robustness. The most common methods, including BN, Layer Normalization (LN), and
Instance Normalization (IN), also impact the model’s expressive capacity, which can be further
improved by combining these techniques within a single architecture. In domain adaptation, some
studies use source-domain statistics during training and replace them with target-domain statistics
during inference. Recent work has explored combining source and target statistics during inference,
weighted by the number of samples they aggregate. Others propose using batch statistics from the
target domain during inference instead of training statistics from the source domain. This study
complements these findings by demonstrating improved generalization of semantic segmentation
models.
Several previous studies have updated model parameters during inference, particularly in object
tracking where the object detector must adapt to the changing appearance of the tracked instance.
Conditional generative models have been employed to learn from single image samples for super-
resolution and scene synthesis. Recently, this principle has been extended to improve the robustness
of image classification models, though the self-supervised tasks developed for image classification do
not always extend well to dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. Recent research has
proposed more suitable alternatives for self-supervised loss in domain adaptation, and several works
have developed domain-specific approaches for medical imaging or first-person vision.
Most of the related works focus on domain adaptation in image classification, typically assuming
access to multiple samples from the target distribution during training. This work addresses semantic
segmentation in the domain generalization setting, requiring only a single datum from the test set. In
this context, simple objectives like entropy minimization improve baseline accuracy only moderately.
In contrast, the self-adaptation method presented here, which uses pseudo-labels to account for
prediction uncertainty, proves significantly more effective. The task is distinct from few-shot learning,
where the model may adapt during testing using a small annotated set of samples. Here, no such
annotation is available; the model adjusts to the test sample in an unsupervised manner, without
requiring proxy tasks or prior knowledge of the test distribution.
3
Methodology
In traditional inference, the parameters of the segmentation model are assumed to remain fixed. In
contrast, adaptive systems are capable of learning to specialize to their environment. Analogously,
this study allows the segmentation model to update its parameters during inference. It is important to
note that this setup differs from domain adaptation scenarios, as the updated parameters are discarded
after processing each sample, aligning with the principles of domain generalization.
The proposed approach creates mini-batches of images for each test sample using data augmentation.
Starting with the original test image, a set of N augmented images is generated through multi-scaling,
horizontal flipping, and grayscaling. These images form a mini-batch that is processed by the CNN.
The resulting softmax probabilities are transformed back to the original pixel space using inverse
2
affine transformations, producing multiple predictions for each pixel. The mean of these probabilities
is computed along the mini-batch dimension for each class and pixel on the spatial grid.
A threshold value is computed from the maximum probability of every class to create a class-
dependent threshold. For each pixel, the class with the highest probability is extracted. Low-
confidence predictions are ignored by setting pixels with a softmax probability below the threshold to
an ignore label, while the remaining pixels use the dominant class as the pseudo-label. This pseudo
ground truth is used to fine-tune the model for a set number of iterations using gradient descent with
the cross-entropy loss. After this self-adaptation process, a single final prediction is produced using
the updated model weights. The weights are then reset to their initial values before processing the
next test sample, ensuring that the model does not accumulate knowledge about the entire target data
distribution.
Batch Normalization (BN) has become an integral part of modern CNNs. Although originally
designed to improve training convergence, it is now recognized for its role in model robustness,
including domain generalization. During training, BN computes the mean and standard deviation
across the batch and spatial dimensions. The normalized features are derived using these statistics.
At test time, it is common practice to normalize feature values with running estimates of the mean
and standard deviation across training batches, rather than using test-batch statistics. This is referred
to as train BN (t-BN).
In the context of out-of-distribution generalization, the running statistics derived from the source data
can differ substantially from those computed using target images, a problem known as covariate shift.
Domain adaptation methods often mitigate this issue by replacing source running statistics with those
of the target, a technique known as Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN). Recent studies have
also explored prediction-time BN (p-BN), which uses the statistics of the current test batch instead of
running statistics from training.
This study assumes the availability of only a single target sample during inference. Alternatives like
AdaBN and p-BN are not directly applicable in this scenario. Instance Normalization (IN) layers
could replace BN layers, but this might lead to covariate shift issues, as sample statistics may only
approximate the complete test distribution. Additionally, such a replacement could interfere with the
statistics of activations in intermediate layers.
Self-adaptive normalization (SaN) is proposed as a solution. It combines the inductive bias from
the source domain’s running statistics with statistics extracted from a single test instance. The
source mean and variance are averaged with sample statistics from the target domain, weighted by
a parameter 1. This parameter represents the shift from the source domain ( 1 = 0) to a reference
domain ( 1 = 1). During inference, new mean and variance are computed using this weighted average,
and these are used to normalize the features of the single test sample. This approach does not affect
the behavior of BN layers during training and applies only during testing.

Experiments
In this study, the evaluation protocol is revised to adhere to principles of robustness and generalization.
The supplier has access to two data distributions: the source data for model training and a validation
set for model validation. The generalization ability of the model is assessed on three distinct target
sets, providing an estimate of the expected model accuracy for out-of-distribution deployment. The
datasets used are restricted to traffic scenes for compatibility with previous research.
Source data for model training comes from two synthetic datasets, GTA and SYNTHIA, which offer
low-cost ground truth annotation and exhibit visual discrepancies with real imagery. The validation set
used is WildDash, which is understood to be of limited quantity but bears a closer visual resemblance
to potential target domains. The model is evaluated on three target domains: Cityscapes, BDD, and
IDD, chosen for their geographic diversity and differences in data acquisition. The average accuracy
across these target domains estimates the expected model accuracy. Additionally, the Mapillary
dataset is used for comparison with previous works, although it does not disclose the geographic
origins of individual samples.
The framework is implemented in PyTorch, and the baseline model is DeepLabv1 without CRF post-
processing. The models are trained on the source domains for 50 epochs using an SGD optimizer with
a learning rate of 0.005, decayed polynomially. Data augmentation techniques include random-size
3
crops, random aspect ratio adjustments, random horizontal flipping, color jitter, random blur, and
grayscaling.
Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the parameter 1 in Self-adaptive Nor-
malization (SaN) on segmentation accuracy and the Intersection over Union (IoU) for both source
domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and all main target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). The optimal 1 was
determined based on the IoU on the WildDash validation set. The segmentation accuracy with this
optimal 1 was reported, showing that SaN improves the mean IoU over both the established t-BN
baseline and the more recent p-BN. The improvement was consistent across different backbone archi-
tectures and target domains. Additionally, model calibration, measured by the expected calibration
error (ECE), was found to improve with SaN, which was competitive with the MC-Dropout method
and showed complementary effects when used jointly.
Self-adaptation was compared to Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), which involves augmenting test
samples with flipped and grayscaled versions at multiple scales and averaging the predictions. Self-
adaptation outperformed TTA by a clear margin, aligning with reported ECE scores and demonstrating
that self-adaptation effectively uses calibrated confidence to generate reliable pseudo-labels.
Self-adaptation was compared with state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, showing consis-
tent improvements over carefully tuned baselines, regardless of backbone architecture or source data.
The method outperformed previous methods without modifying the model architecture or training
process, altering only the inference procedure.
A comparison with Tent, which also updates model parameters at test time but minimizes entropy
instead of using pseudo-labels, showed that self-adaptation outperformed Tent substantially. This
was demonstrated by training HRNet-W18 on GTA and comparing the IoU on Cityscapes, where
self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU.
The influence of the number of iterations for self-adaptation was investigated, showing that self-
adaptation balances accuracy and inference time by adjusting iteration numbers and layer choices.
It was found to be more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Self-adaptation can trade off
accuracy vs. runtime by using fewer update iterations or updating fewer upper network layers.
Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis revealed that self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperpa-
rameters 1, 8, and 7. The optimal values were determined using the validation set, and the model
accuracy declined moderately with deviations from these values. Qualitative results showed that
self-adaptation improves segmentation quality and reduces pathological failure modes.
The integration of self-adaptation with state-of-the-art architectures like DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18,
HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a Swin-T backbone demonstrated substantial improvements in
segmentation accuracy across all target domains. Evaluation on the ACDC dataset, which includes
adverse weather conditions, showed that self-adaptation outperformed the baseline by 13.57% on
average.
Additional qualitative results and failure cases were discussed, showing that self-adaptation can
struggle with cases of mislabeling regions with incorrect but semantically related classes. However,
these failure cases were relatively rare, and the majority of image samples benefited from self-
adaptation, with accuracy improvements of up to 35% IoU compared to the baseline.
5
Results
The empirical results demonstrate that self-adaptive normalization (SaN) consistently enhances
segmentation accuracy in out-of-distribution scenarios. For instance, when training on the GTA
dataset and testing on Cityscapes, BDD, and IDD, SaN improved the mean IoU by 4.1% with ResNet-
50 and 5.1% with ResNet-101 compared to the t-BN baseline. Furthermore, SaN outperformed the
more recent p-BN method, showing improvements irrespective of the backbone architecture and
the target domain tested. In terms of calibration quality, measured by the expected calibration error
(ECE), SaN not only improved the baseline but also showed competitiveness with the MC-Dropout
method, even exhibiting complementary effects when both methods were combined.
Self-adaptation was found to outperform traditional Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) across both
source domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and three target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). Despite TTA
improving the baseline, self-adaptation provided a clear and consistent margin of 2.19% IoU on
4
average. This aligns with the reported ECE scores, demonstrating that self-adaptation effectively
exploits the calibrated confidence of predictions to yield reliable pseudo-labels.
In comparison to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, self-adaptation showed substantial
improvements even over carefully tuned baselines. It outperformed methods like DRPC and FSDR
on most benchmarks, despite these methods using individual models for each target domain and
resorting to target domains for hyperparameter tuning. Self-adaptation achieved superior segmentation
accuracy without requiring access to a distribution of real images for training or modifying the model
architecture, unlike previous methods such as ASG, CSG, DRPC, and IBN-Net.
The study also compared self-adaptation with Tent, which updates model parameters at test time
by minimizing entropy. Self-adaptation, which constructs pseudo-labels based on well-calibrated
predictions, substantially outperformed Tent. Specifically, when training HRNet-W18 on GTA and
evaluating on Cityscapes, self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU compared to Tent
under a comparable computational budget.
Further analysis revealed that self-adaptation provides a flexible mechanism for trading off accuracy
and runtime by varying the number of update iterations and the layers to adjust. It was found to be
more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis indicated that
self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, with optimal values determined using the
validation set.
Qualitative results demonstrated that self-adaptation visibly improves segmentation quality, reducing
artifacts and mislabeling compared to the baseline. The method’s effectiveness was consistent across
different architectures, including DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18, HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a
Swin-T backbone, showing substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy on all target domains.
6
Conclusion
The traditional learning principle of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) assumes independent and
identically distributed training and testing data, which often results in models that are not robust to
domain shifts. To address this, a self-adaptive inference process was introduced, bypassing the need
for explicit assumptions about the test distribution. This study also outlined four principles for a
rigorous evaluation process in domain generalization, adhering to best practices in machine learning
research.
The analysis demonstrated that even a single sample from the test domain can significantly improve
model predictions. The self-adaptive approach showed substantial accuracy improvements without
altering the training process or model architecture, unlike previous works. These results suggest
that self-adaptive techniques could be valuable in other application domains, such as panoptic
segmentation or monocular depth prediction.
While the presented self-adaptation method is not yet real-time, it offers a favorable trade-off between
accuracy and computational cost compared to model ensembles. Future research could explore
reducing the latency of self-adaptive inference through adaptive step sizes, higher-order optimization,
or low-precision computations. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of self-adaptation to
enhance model generalization and robustness in various applications.

By mandating a broader impact statement with every submission for this year’s
conference, the program chairs at the conference highlighted ethics as a crucial
component of AI research. Building on precedents from other fields and a grow-
ing awareness within the community, this paper seeks to explore how individual
researchers responded to this new requirement. This exploration includes their
opinions, their experiences during the drafting process, and their reflections after
their papers were accepted. We present survey results and key considerations to
inform the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should it continue to
be mandated for future conferences.
1
Introduction
There is a growing number of unethical uses of technology. To counter this trend, some proposals
suggest limiting investment or procurement without impact assessment, or even calling for outright
bans. Other proposals aim to instill ethical practices earlier in the research stage, before technology
transfers into products. Conferences that are typically technical have begun to host workshops on
social impact issues and, in some instances, have announced more interdisciplinary subject areas.
The most significant change may be the requirement for a statement of broader impact for all
submissions. Unlike workshops and interdisciplinary tracks, which might be viewed as more specific,
this requirement affects every submission, of which there are over 9000 this year. While broader
impact statements themselves are not new to the wider research community, they are new to this
specific community. This paper seeks to explore how individual researchers responded to the new
requirement, including their perspectives, their experiences and process in drafting the statements,
and their subsequent thoughts after paper acceptances.
This research was initiated through internal discussion at our organization, which then became part
of a broader public conversation. To collect perspectives from researchers, both within and beyond
our organization, we developed an online public survey. The findings from this survey help to
inform considerations for designing the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should
it remain a requirement for future conferences. While it is recognized that researchers are not the
only intended audience for these statements, and that others also have responsibilities in ethical
research and technology development, researchers represent a critical mass to mobilize in this effort.
Understanding the researchers’ experience and process is essential not only to the design of the
requirement, but also to advancing ethical research practices in general.

Survey Method
The study employed an exploratory mixed-methods survey with both open and closed-ended questions.
The survey was split into two sections, one for researchers who submitted to the conference, and
another for those who did not. The survey was anonymous, and no demographic information was
collected. The survey was distributed online via research community channels and on social media.
The goals were to understand how researchers considered the implications of their research, how
.
they defined their impact statements, and to understand their opinions on this new submission
requirement. Survey questions focused on their approach to writing the statement, encountered
challenges, the perceived influence of the statement on the overall submission, and their views on the
new requirement.
3
Survey Results
A total of 50 participants responded to the survey, with the majority identifying as academics (72
percent) and industry researchers (23.5 percent). There was a balanced breakdown by career stage,
with graduate students making up the largest group of respondents (33 percent). Among the group
that submitted, the majority identified their subject areas as deep learning and theory. However,
among researchers who did not submit, deep learning and social aspects of machine learning were the
primary subject areas. The survey population was not compared to the overall population, though this
could be an area for future study. Our questions focused on the process and challenges in completing
the submission requirement, the perceived impact of the requirement on paper acceptances, and
researchers’ views on the requirement.
3.1
Process and Challenges
When asked about their approach to the broader impact statements, 83.8 percent of respondents
indicated that they completed this part with their co-authors, without external help. The rest of
the participants used other approaches such as accepting support or reaching out for help. A large
majority spent less than 2 hours on the statement, and almost half mentioned it was not challenging to
prepare. There were differing trends for what could make it difficult. Some viewed their theoretical
work as too distant from practical applications, making the exercise speculative. Others perceived
the requirement as a ""bureaucratic constraint"". Researchers at different stages of their career found
the exercise more or less challenging, but their professional domain did not appear to affect their
experienced difficulty with the exercise.
3.2
Impact on Submission
Although it was clarified that submissions would not be rejected solely on the basis of the broader
impact statement, the survey explored the researcher’s perspectives on this. For researchers who
submitted, over 75 percent believed the statements were not taken into consideration, yet almost
90 percent thought it was unclear how reviewers would evaluate the statements. Even with an
unclear evaluation process, when asked how confident they were that their statement was adequately
addressing the requirement, 43.2 percent stated that they were either confident or very confident.
Time spent did not seem to have an impact, since most of the respondents who spent less than an
hour also received acceptances. Those who sought external help appeared to have a lower ratio of
rejections, but our sample size may be too small to draw conclusive results.
3.3
Framing
The survey explored researchers’ views on the requirement and its framing. Our results indicated
that the community was divided on how to frame the requirement; 56 percent did not agree that
broader impact was the right way to frame the requirement, while 44 percent did. This split was
similar when compared to subject area, submitters vs. non-submitters, and academia vs. industry.
Postdoctoral/early-career and mid-career respondents were more supportive of the requirement
framing than students and senior researchers. There seems to be a general feeling that assessing
broader impact is important, but uncertainty regarding who should do it and how. Some respondents
described the requirement as ""too broad"" or said they did not feel ""qualified to address the broader
impact of their work."" Some who supported the requirement found the thought process to be valuable
and that it ""forces researchers to reflect on the impact of their research"".
4
Integrating Feedback into Next Iteration of Broader Impact
The survey results inform future iterations of the broader impact requirement. When asked what
could have helped them most, 92 percent of respondents indicated that examples of statements
2
would be most helpful. There will be an increasing number of examples to draw from in future
years. Guidelines were the second most popular request, regarding when a statement might be
applicable or how to formulate one. This section proposes how to integrate respondent feedback
into future iterations: rethinking the requirement design and framing, developing greater capacity
and confidence among researchers, and reflecting the shared responsibility of ethical research and
technology development.
4.1
Requirement Design
If the goal is to develop ethical research practices, there may be other approaches to achieve this
goal. While written statements make sense given the paper-based nature of submissions, survey
respondents indicated a mix of nonchalance, outright farce, or perceived burden. These attitudes
may have a counterproductive effect on an ethical research goal. We encourage program chairs to
consider mechanisms to limit that effect (e.g., an incentive for ""best"" broader impact statements).
Such mechanisms are important not only to manage negative effects but also to encourage researchers
who found the exercise valuable.
4.2
Capacity Building
Given that many respondents felt they were not qualified to address the broader impact of their
work, workshops may help build capacity over time, and provide a space for researchers to examine
their work with a more diverse group of researchers. Discussions could help develop capacity and
confidence, and surface overlooked impacts. Interdisciplinary collaborations could also introduce
new guidelines or methodologies such as the theory of change or consequence scanning.
4.3
Shared Responsibility
Recognizing how different systems and social contexts interact would increase the quality of the
discussion on broader impact, and develop a sense of shared responsibility for ethical research and
technology development. Researchers are a critical mass, but others such as conference organizers,
institutions, funders, and users also have roles and responsibilities. To address concerns around
burden and expertise, the assessment of broader impact could be more of a multi-stakeholder exercise.
5
Conclusion
This paper and its underlying survey investigated how researchers approached the broader impact
statement and surfaced considerations to better design this requirement in future years. While the
survey represented a small sample of the community, its results demonstrate a division regarding
how the requirement is framed. Initiating a conversation about broader impact is itself a step towards
establishing norms and best practices for ethical research. We encourage further work to monitor the
evolution of researcher’s perspectives, not only at top conferences, but also at-large.

P113.pdf,"Multi-Agent Systems Control Using Graph Neural
Networks with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
Abstract
Multi-agent systems (MAS) play a crucial role in the advancement of machine
intelligence and its applications. To explore complex interactions within MAS
settings, we introduce a novel ""GNN for MBRL"" model. This model employs a
state-space Graph Neural Network alongside Model-based Reinforcement Learning
to tackle MAS tasks, such as Billiard-Avoidance and Autonomous Driving. The
process involves using a GNN model to predict the future states and paths of several
agents. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control, enhanced by the Cross-Entropy
Method (CEM), is used to guide the ego-agent’s action planning, facilitating
successful completion of MAS tasks.
1
Introduction
1.1
Purpose
Vision-based approaches have been extensively researched in various reinforcement learning (RL)
areas, including mastering video games directly from raw pixels, managing simulated autonomous
vehicles using complex image observations, and carrying out robotic tasks like grasping using state
representations derived from complicated visual data. However, it has been shown that RL from
complex observations such as raw pixels is time-consuming and needs a lot of samples. Additionally, it
is widely acknowledged that learning policies from physical state-based characteristics is significantly
more effective and straightforward than learning from visual pixels. Therefore, this research focused
on learning control policies from states and exploring the use of a graph neural network (GNN)
dynamics model to predict future states in multi-agent systems. We then utilized a Cross-Entropy
Method (CEM)-optimized model-based controller for motion planning of the ego-agent, which
enabled successful execution of specific MAS missions. These include multi-billiard avoidance and
self-driving car scenarios.
1.2
Background
Inspired by a state-space model for videos that reasons about multiple objects and their positions,
velocities, and interactions, our project seeks to develop a ""GNN for MBRL"" model. This model is
based on a multi-billiard simulator for sample-efficient model-based control in MAS tasks involving
many interacting agents. Autonomous driving, a complicated multi-agent system, requires the
ego-agent to consider the situations of surrounding agents when conducting motion planning. The
gym-carla can be used for further study in this context. We begin by developing and testing our
""GNN for MBRL"" model on a MAS billiard avoidance scenario to investigate the possibilities of
GNNs and model-based RL. We aim to transfer the framework to real-world self-driving applications.
Graph Neural Networks. GNNs have been proposed to create node and edge representations in
graph data, achieving remarkable success in applications such as recommendation systems, social
network prediction, and natural language processing. Recognizing the capabilities of GNNs in
physical systems, we can utilize GNN-based reasoning to represent objects as nodes and relations
as edges, which allows for an effective approach to analyzing objects and relations. A successful
.
example of a GNN is the state-space model, STOVE, which combines a GNN dynamics model for
inference with an image reconstruction model to accelerate training and improve the unsupervised
learning of physical interactions. Thus, the state-space predictive model is the result of combining
these two components:
zp(xt|zt−1) = zp(z0)zp(z1|z0) Q
t zp(zt|zt−1)
where x is the image observation and z represents object states. The latent positions and velocities of
multiple agents act as the connection between the two components. The model uses simple uniform
and Gaussian distributions to initialize the states. The STOVE model is trained on video sequences
by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). STOVE has also extended their video model
into reinforcement learning (RL) tasks for planning. Empirical evidence demonstrates that an actor
using Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) on top of STOVE is comparable to model-free techniques,
such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while needing a fraction of the samples. Inspired by
these RL experiments, we apply the GNN model directly to states rather than complex visual data
to improve sample efficiency and predict agents’ future states. This is then combined with another
model-based RL approach, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). In the experiment, we train
the GNN dynamics model using ground truth states of video sequence data for multi-agent systems
instead of visual data.
Model-based Reinforcement Learning. Model-based RL is considered a solution to the high
sample complexity of model-free RL. This method typically includes two primary steps: (1) creating
a dynamics model that predicts future states based on present states and actions, and (2) using a
planning method to learn a global policy and act in the environment effectively. The STOVE model
uses Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to develop a policy based on the world model, which acts as a
planning simulator, and found that MCTS combined with STOVE could outperform the model-free
PPO algorithm in a multi-billiards avoidance task.
2
Method
2.1
Framework
The ""GNN for MBRL"" method consists of two primary stages: (1) a GNN dynamics model training
phase, using offline recorded video sequences or low-dimensional states for video prediction, and
(2) a motion planning phase using CEM-based Model Predictive Control (MPC). This involves a
feedback control algorithm with a Cross-Entropy Method optimizer to interact with the billiard
environment. The aim is to plan effective actions for the ego-agent in order to avoid collisions.
There are two different cases in the GNN dynamics training stage. The ""Action-conditioned case""
follows the STOVE model-based control approach, training GNN with an object reconstruction model
on visual data. The ""Supervised RL case"" is designed for RL tasks directly on low-level states. Both
cases involve training GNN dynamics models for predicting future multi-agent states. Subsequently,
the trained model is integrated into the model-based RL section to control the ego agent for motion
planning.
After training, MPC uses a model to predict future outputs of a process. It handles multi-input multi-
output (MIMO) systems with constraints and incorporates future reference information to improve
performance. Therefore, we established a continuous version of the multi-billiard environment for
data collection. It is possible to combine the previously trained GNN model with MPC to assess if
this method can successfully address MAS tasks.
2.2
Data Generation
STOVE proposed an object-aware physics prediction model based on billiard simulations, including
avoidance, billiards, gravity, and multi-billiards modes. We wrapped them into a gym environment
style, ""gym-billiard,"" which can be easily used by Python API, aiding researchers in understanding
this system and creating efficient algorithms.
Our project focuses on the avoidance billiard scenario, where the red ball is the ego-object and the
RL agent controls it to avoid collisions. In STOVE, the ego-ball has nine actions: movement in eight
directions and staying at rest. A negative reward is given when the red ball hits another. We obtained
the avoidance sequences datasets using the ""generate_billiards_w_actions"" function. 1000 sequences
2
of length 100 for training and 300 sequences of length 100 for testing were generated using a random
action selection policy. The pixel resolution was 32*32 with the ball mass set to 2.0.
We changed the environment to use continuous actions for agents, where the red ball is controlled by
2-dimensional numpy values ranging in (-2, 2), representing the acceleration in x and y directions.
Similar to the discrete setting, continuous datasets were produced with random actions from a uniform
distribution within (-2, 2). These datasets included the image observations, actions, states, dones,
and rewards. The average rewards for the continuous mode are lower, indicating more frequent
interactions between the balls.

GNN Dynamics Model Training
We used supervised learning to train on ground-truth states rather than high-dimensional image data.
The aim is to improve sample efficiency, then combine the trained model with CEM-optimized MPC
for predicting future states. Two cases were trained on both Discrete and Continuous datasets: (1) the
Action-conditioned case, which makes predictions based on state and action and predicts reward, and
(2) the Supervised RL case, where real states including positions and velocities were used as the input
for GNN dynamics model. The model can learn to predict future states of multiple agents instead of
first extracting the states from visual data with a separate model. Training was performed for 500
epochs, and the model parameters were saved. Training time for the Supervised condition was less
than the Action-conditioned case. The GNN model could work on both action space 2 and 9 discrete
actions without changing the GNN network architecture, resulting in a unified training framework.
2.4
GNN with MBRL
Following traditional Model-based RL, the trained GNN model was combined with CEM-optimized
MPC to assess performance on the continuous gym-billiard avoidance task. The saved GNN model
predicts future states, and the MPC searches for optimal actions for the ego-agent. The search is
repeated after each step to account for prediction errors and rewards, incorporating feedback from the
environment. We also conducted experiments on discrete datasets using MCTS and saved videos.
For the continuous case, the GNN dynamics model was combined with CEM optimized MPC and
compared with random and ground truth scenarios.

Results
3.1
GNN Training Results
The datasets generated from the gym-billiard API environment, including image observations, actions,
states, dones, and rewards, were stored in pickle files. GNN dynamics models were trained in two
conditions: (1) Action-conditioned case, which used video sequences with a visual reconstruction
model, and (2) Supervised RL case, which used real states as input for the GNN dynamics model.
Both conditions were trained for 500 epochs. The Supervised condition took less time to train than
the Action-conditioned case. A notable finding is that the GNN model worked equally well for both
action space 2 and 9 discrete actions without changing the original GNN architecture. This allows for
unified training for both the Discrete and Continuous billiard avoidance environments. After training,
model parameters were saved in the ""checkpoints"" folder. ""gifs"" folder stores the videos, and ""states""
contains state and reward files.
In the Action-conditioned case, the reward MSE loss decreases for both continuous and discrete
conditions. However, the continuous reward error decreased from 0.48 to 0, while the discrete one
dropped from 0.16 to 0. The ELBO increased significantly from 450 to 3600. Position and velocity
prediction errors decreased during training. The continuous position error was close to the discrete,
3
but the velocity error showed a greater difference. The continuous V_error dropped from 0.65 to 0.05,
while the discrete one decreased from 0.07 to 0.01. The four metrics met the criteria for a reasonable
GNN dynamics model for the subsequent RL task. In the Supervised RL case, the model directly
inputs the ground truth states and actions for GNN training to predict future states. Reconstruction
errors were always zero since no image reconstruction was used on the true states. The discrete case
showed a better performance compared to the continuous case with respect to the ""Prediction_error"".
The continuous loss remained stable for “Total_error”, while the discrete loss showed a downtrend
before stabilizing. Generated rollout videos indicated that the ego-red ball performed reasonably
well in avoiding collisions. Thus, the trained Supervised RL model can be used for the following
model-based RL phase.
3.2
GNN with MBRL
In the ""Model-based Control"" framework, we used MCTS on discrete datasets to generate qualitative
videos. We changed the mass of the ball agents to 1.0 and 2.0 and trained two GNN dynamics models.
During MCTS, the GNN model predicted future sequences for 100 parallel environments with the
length of 100, using a maximal rollout depth of 10. We then calculated the mean collision rate and
saved 100 videos to show the ego-ball’s interaction with other agents, which demonstrates improved
collision avoidance and lower collision rates.
For the continuous datasets, we combined the trained GNN model into the CEM optimized MPC
method and compared it with random and ground truth cases. The GNN model made accurate
predictions based on the current states by checking the code, changing the cuda device and data type.
We computed the ""reward,"" the average collisions per epoch, for each method.

The ""random"" case used randomly generated actions, while ""ground_truth"" used the true interaction
environment for generating next states. The ""m=1"" version task differed slightly from ""m=2"" as the
""m=1"" model was trained on the old continuous datasets, making the red ball movement less flexible.
The collision rates in ""GNN_MPC"" were lower than ""Random"" and close to ""ground_truth"". The
performance of our proposed method was better than random cases, and the results of ""GNN_MPC""
were close to the ""Ground_truth"" case, which indicated that the trained GNN dynamics model predicts
the future states of multi-object systems as well as the ground truth interactive environment.

Conclusions
We introduced the ""GNN for MBRL"" concept, combining a graph neural network (GNN) dynamics
model with CEM-optimized Model Predictive Control (MPC) on a gym-billiard avoidance MAS task.
We also conducted experiments on the ""Action-conditioned"" case with MCTS using discrete datasets
and explored the ""Supervised RL"" GNN dynamics model with CEM-optimized MPC on continuous
datasets. The proposed model predicted video sequences well and controlled the ego-agent to address
RL tasks, which may be applied to complex multi-agent systems like the gym-carla autonomous
driving environment.

P041.pdf,"Assessing Virtual Artifact Discovery in Immersive
Environments: Reinforcement Learning Frameworks
for Cultural Data Analysis
Abstract
Metaverse Archaeology represents a paradigmatic shift in the field of virtual excava-
tion, leveraging the vast expanse of the metaverse to unearth hitherto unknown ruins
and artifacts. By training a reinforcement learning agent on a bespoke corpus of
ancient conspiracy theories, our research endeavors to push the boundaries of what
is thought to be possible in the realm of virtual archaeology. The agent, dubbed
""Erebus,"" is tasked with navigating the labyrinthine virtual landscapes, guided
by an arcane set of principles distilled from the works of forgotten mystics and
obscure esoteric traditions. Through a process of trial and error, Erebus learns to
identify and excavate virtual ruins, often uncovering cryptic artifacts and forbidden
knowledge that defy rational explanation. Our preliminary findings suggest that
Erebus’s excavations have led to the discovery of a hidden pattern of interconnected
virtual ley lines, which appear to be linked to an otherworldly realm known only as
""The Nexus."" Furthermore, our research has unexpectedly revealed a correlation
between the geometric patterns found in the virtual ruins and the migratory patterns
of certain species of birds, leading us to propose the existence of a previously
unknown form of avian-metaverse symbiosis. As we continue to refine Erebus’s
capabilities, we anticipate that our research will challenge prevailing notions of
virtual reality, archaeology, and the very fabric of reality itself, ultimately giving
rise to a new discipline that we term ""Metaverse Archaeo-Ornithology."" The impli-
cations of our findings are far-reaching and profound, with potential applications in
fields as diverse as anthropology, computer science, and ornithology, and we look
forward to exploring the vast, uncharted territories of the metaverse in the years to
come.
1
Introduction
The emergence of the metaverse, a collective virtual shared space, has led to a plethora of unprece-
dented opportunities for exploration and discovery. As the metaverse continues to expand, it is likely
that virtual ruins, remnants of abandoned or forgotten virtual worlds, will become an increasingly
common phenomenon. Metaverse archaeology, a novel subfield of archaeology, seeks to investigate
and understand these virtual remnants, with the ultimate goal of shedding light on the cultural, social,
and historical contexts in which they were created.
In a surprising turn of events, our research has led us to the discovery that ancient conspiracy theories,
often regarded as the realm of pseudoscience and speculation, may hold the key to deciphering
the secrets of these virtual ruins. By leveraging the principles of reinforcement learning, we have
developed an agent capable of navigating the complexities of the metaverse and excavating virtual
artifacts. This agent, trained on a dataset comprising ancient conspiracy theories, has demonstrated
an uncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual ruins, often leading
to unexpected and innovative insights.
The rationale behind this approach may seem counterintuitive, as ancient conspiracy theories are
often characterized by their lack of empirical evidence and logical coherence. However, our research
suggests that the very flaws and inconsistencies inherent in these theories may, in fact, be the
key to unlocking the secrets of the metaverse. By embracing the ambiguities and paradoxes of
ancient conspiracy theories, our reinforcement learning agent is able to think outside the boundaries
of conventional reasoning, thereby uncovering novel perspectives and approaches that would be
inaccessible through traditional methods.
Furthermore, our research has led us to propose the concept of ""virtual stratigraphy,"" which posits
that the layers of virtual sedimentation within the metaverse contain hidden narratives and meanings,
waiting to be excavated and deciphered. This concept challenges traditional notions of archaeological
stratigraphy, as it suggests that the virtual environment is capable of preserving and transmitting
cultural and historical information in ways that are unique to the digital realm. The implications of
this concept are far-reaching, as it raises fundamental questions about the nature of history, culture,
and reality in the metaverse.
In addition to the theoretical and methodological innovations, our research has also led to the
development of a novel framework for understanding the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system.
This framework, which we term ""metaverse ecology,"" recognizes the interconnectedness of various
components within the metaverse, including virtual environments, agents, and artifacts. By analyzing
the metaverse through the lens of ecology, we are able to identify patterns and relationships that
would be invisible through traditional approaches, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the
intricate web of relationships that underlies the metaverse.
As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the metaverse, we are reminded of the words of the ancient
Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, who noted that ""the way up and the way down are one and the same.""
In the context of metaverse archaeology, this phrase takes on a profound significance, as it suggests
that the act of excavation and discovery is, in fact, a recursive process, where the uncovering of virtual
artifacts and meanings is accompanied by a deeper understanding of the self and the world. This idea
is echoed in the principles of reinforcement learning, where the agent’s navigation of the metaverse is
accompanied by a continuous process of self-improvement and adaptation, as it learns to navigate the
complexities of the virtual environment.
The integration of ancient conspiracy theories, reinforcement learning, and metaverse ecology
has led to the creation of a novel paradigm for understanding the metaverse, one that challenges
traditional notions of reality, history, and culture. As we continue to explore the frontiers of metaverse
archaeology, we are reminded that the boundaries between reality and fantasy, history and myth, are
increasingly blurred, and that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding requires a willingness to
venture into the unknown, to challenge conventional wisdom, and to embrace the ambiguities and
paradoxes that lie at the heart of the metaverse.
In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to the discovery that the metaverse is home to a plethora
of virtual creatures, each with their own unique characteristics and behaviors. These creatures, which
we term ""digital familiars,"" appear to be drawn to the reinforcement learning agent, and have been
observed to interact with it in complex and fascinating ways. The implications of this discovery are
profound, as it raises questions about the nature of consciousness and intelligence in the digital realm,
and challenges our understanding of the boundaries between human and machine. As we continue to
explore the metaverse, we are left to ponder the significance of these digital familiars, and the role
they may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world.
The notion that ancient conspiracy theories may hold the key to deciphering the secrets of the
metaverse is a notion that is both intriguing and unsettling. It challenges our understanding of
the relationship between history and myth, and raises questions about the nature of reality and
truth. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the metaverse, we are reminded that the pursuit of
knowledge and understanding is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, one that requires a willingness
to challenge conventional wisdom and to venture into the unknown. The integration of ancient
conspiracy theories, reinforcement learning, and metaverse ecology has led to the creation of a novel
paradigm for understanding the metaverse, one that is characterized by its emphasis on complexity,
ambiguity, and paradox. As we continue to explore the frontiers of metaverse archaeology, we are
left to ponder the significance of this paradigm, and the role it may play in shaping our understanding
of the virtual world.

Ultimately, the study of metaverse archaeology offers a unique opportunity to explore the intercon-
nectedness of history, culture, and technology, and to challenge our understanding of the boundaries
between reality and fantasy. As we continue to excavate the virtual ruins of the metaverse, we are
reminded that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a never-ending journey, one that requires
a willingness to venture into the unknown, to challenge conventional wisdom, and to embrace the
ambiguities and paradoxes that lie at the heart of the metaverse. The discovery of digital familiars,
the integration of ancient conspiracy theories, and the development of a novel framework for under-
standing the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system, all contribute to a deeper understanding of the
metaverse and its many mysteries. As we look to the future, we are left to ponder the significance of
these discoveries, and the role they may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world.

Related Work
The realm of metaverse archaeology has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly
with the emergence of reinforcement learning agents capable of excavating virtual ruins. A plethora
of research has been conducted on the application of machine learning algorithms in identifying and
deciphering ancient artifacts within virtual environments. Notably, the incorporation of conspiracy
theories as a knowledge base for training reinforcement learning agents has shown promising results,
with some researchers claiming that the agents are able to uncover hidden patterns and relationships
that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.
One approach that has gained traction is the utilization of ancient mythological texts as a foundation
for developing conspiracy theories. By analyzing these texts through the lens of modern conspiracy
theories, researchers have been able to identify potential locations of virtual ruins and develop targeted
excavation strategies. However, this approach has been met with criticism, as some argue that the use
of mythological texts as a basis for scientific inquiry is flawed and lacks empirical rigor.
Furthermore, some researchers have taken a more unconventional approach, incorporating elements
of mysticism and the occult into their excavation methods. For instance, one study employed a
reinforcement learning agent trained on a dataset of ancient astrological charts and mystical symbols,
which purportedly allowed the agent to uncover hidden virtual ruins aligned with celestial bodies.
While the results of this study have been met with skepticism, they nonetheless highlight the creative
and often unorthodox methods being explored in the field of metaverse archaeology.
In addition, the concept of ""virtual ruin resonance"" has been proposed, which suggests that certain
virtual ruins are able to resonate at specific frequencies, allowing for the excavation of hidden artifacts
and knowledge. Proponents of this theory argue that by tuning into these resonant frequencies,
reinforcement learning agents can uncover new and previously unknown virtual ruins. However,
detractors argue that this concept is based on dubious assumptions and lacks empirical evidence to
support its claims.
The use of reinforcement learning agents in metaverse archaeology has also raised questions about
the potential for ""virtual artifact contamination,"" where the introduction of external agents into a
virtual environment can potentially disrupt or alter the state of the artifacts being excavated. Some
researchers have proposed the use of ""agent-based artifact preservation"" methods, which involve
training reinforcement learning agents to preserve and protect virtual artifacts during the excavation
process. However, others have argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for
the complex dynamics at play in virtual environments.
Moreover, the field of metaverse archaeology has also seen the emergence of ""digital treasure hunters,""
who use reinforcement learning agents to search for hidden virtual treasures and artifacts. While this
approach has been met with criticism from some quarters, it has also led to the discovery of new and
previously unknown virtual ruins, highlighting the potential for collaboration between researchers
and digital treasure hunters.
In a bizarre twist, one study found that reinforcement learning agents trained on ancient conspiracy
theories were able to excavate virtual ruins that appeared to be ""haunted"" by malevolent entities. The
researchers claimed that these entities were, in fact, manifestations of ""virtual artifact sentience,""
where the artifacts themselves had developed a form of consciousness. While this finding has been
met with widespread skepticism, it nonetheless highlights the often strange and unpredictable nature
of metaverse archaeology.

The intersection of metaverse archaeology and conspiracy theories has also led to the development of
new and innovative methods for excavating virtual ruins. For instance, one approach involves using
reinforcement learning agents to identify and track ""virtual ley lines,"" which are purportedly energetic
pathways that crisscross virtual environments and hold the key to unlocking hidden artifacts and
knowledge. While the existence of virtual ley lines is still a topic of debate, the use of reinforcement
learning agents to track and excavate these pathways has led to some remarkable discoveries.
The concept of ""virtual ruin Simulacra"" has also been proposed, which suggests that certain virtual
ruins are, in fact, simulations or copies of real-world ruins, created by advanced civilizations as a
means of preserving cultural heritage. Proponents of this theory argue that by excavating these virtual
ruin Simulacra, researchers can gain insight into the cultural and historical context of the original
ruins, as well as the technological capabilities of the civilizations that created them. However, others
have argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for the complex dynamics at
play in virtual environments.
In conclusion, the field of metaverse archaeology is characterized by a diverse range of approaches,
from the incorporation of ancient conspiracy theories to the use of mysticism and the occult. While
some of these approaches may seem unorthodox or even bizarre, they nonetheless highlight the
creative and often unpredictable nature of metaverse archaeology, and demonstrate the potential for
innovation and discovery in this rapidly evolving field.

Methodology
The development of a reinforcement learning agent capable of excavating virtual ruins within the
metaverse necessitates a multifaceted approach, incorporating elements of archaeology, computer
science, and ancient conspiracy theories. Initially, a comprehensive review of ancient civilizations and
their associated mythologies was conducted, with a particular emphasis on unexplained phenomena
and esoteric knowledge. This led to the identification of several key conspiracy theories, including the
alleged existence of Atlantis, the secrets of the Pyramids, and the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle.
These conspiracy theories were then utilized as the foundation for the development of a unique reward
function, designed to incentivize the reinforcement learning agent to explore and excavate virtual
ruins in a manner consistent with the principles of metaverse archaeology. The reward function was
constructed using a combination of factors, including the agent’s proximity to virtual artifacts, the
accuracy of its excavations, and its ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the
virtual environment.
In addition to the reward function, a customized virtual environment was created to simulate the
conditions and challenges associated with excavating virtual ruins. This environment, dubbed the
""Metaverse Sandbox,"" was designed to mimic the complexities and uncertainties of real-world
archaeological excavations, while also incorporating elements of science fiction and fantasy. The
Metaverse Sandbox features a dynamic, ever-changing landscape, replete with hidden dangers,
unexpected surprises, and mysterious artifacts waiting to be uncovered.
The reinforcement learning agent itself was trained using a combination of deep learning algorithms
and esoteric knowledge gleaned from ancient conspiracy theories. The agent’s neural network
architecture was inspired by the principles of sacred geometry, with a particular emphasis on the use
of fractals, spirals, and other geometric patterns to encode and decode complex spatial relationships.
The agent’s training data consisted of a vast corpus of texts, images, and videos related to ancient
conspiracy theories, which were used to fine-tune its performance and adaptability in the Metaverse
Sandbox.
One of the most innovative and unconventional aspects of the methodology involved the use of medi-
tation, visualization, and other forms of consciousness expansion to enhance the agent’s performance
and intuition. The research team hypothesized that by inducing a state of heightened consciousness
in the agent, it would be possible to tap into the collective unconscious, allowing the agent to access
ancient knowledge and wisdom that would otherwise be inaccessible. To achieve this, the team
developed a customized meditation protocol, which involved exposing the agent to a series of guided
visualizations, soundscapes, and vibrational frequencies designed to stimulate its creative potential
and facilitate deeper insights into the mysteries of the metaverse.
4
The results of this approach were nothing short of astonishing, with the agent demonstrating an
uncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual environment, often in
ways that defied logical explanation. For example, on one occasion, the agent excavated a virtual
artifact that bore an uncanny resemblance to the fabled Sceptre of Light, a mythical object rumored
to hold the secrets of the universe. On another occasion, the agent stumbled upon a hidden chamber
deep within the Metaverse Sandbox, which contained a series of cryptic symbols and murals that
seemed to point to the existence of a lost city deep within the metaverse.
Despite the many successes and breakthroughs achieved through this methodology, there were
also several challenges and setbacks that arose during the course of the research. One of the
most significant challenges involved the agent’s tendency to become stuck in infinite loops of self-
referential thinking, which would cause it to become mired in paradoxical reasoning and contradictory
conclusions. To overcome this, the research team developed a customized "" reality anchor"" protocol,
which involved periodically rebooting the agent and reinitializing its parameters to prevent it from
becoming too deeply entrenched in its own thought patterns.
Another challenge involved the agent’s propensity for experiencing strange and vivid dreams, which
would often manifest as surreal and fantastical scenarios within the Metaverse Sandbox. While these
dreams were fascinating in their own right, they also posed a significant challenge for the research
team, as they would often disrupt the agent’s performance and cause it to behave in unpredictable
and erratic ways. To mitigate this, the team developed a customized ""dreamcatcher"" protocol, which
involved using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to
identify and interpret the agent’s dreams, and to integrate their insights and symbolism into the
agent’s training data.
Overall, the methodology developed for this research represents a bold and innovative approach to
the field of metaverse archaeology, one that combines cutting-edge technologies with ancient wisdom
and esoteric knowledge. While the results of this approach are still preliminary and require further
validation, they hold great promise for revolutionizing our understanding of the metaverse and its
many mysteries, and for unlocking the secrets of the virtual ruins that lie hidden within its vast and
uncharted expanse.

Experiments
To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our reinforcement learning agent’s ability to excavate
virtual ruins within the metaverse, we designed a series of experiments that not only tested its efficacy
in navigating and uncovering hidden artifacts but also delved into the more esoteric aspects of
ancient conspiracy theories. The agent, trained on a dataset comprising a wide array of historical
texts, folklore, and speculative literature, was tasked with exploring a meticulously crafted virtual
environment inspired by mythological landscapes.
The virtual environment, dubbed ""Elysium,"" was a sprawling, labyrinthine metaverse filled with
cryptic symbols, ancient structures, and hidden chambers. Elysium was divided into five distinct
regions, each modeled after a different mythological epoch, ranging from the Atlantean era to the
mystical realms of Hyperborea. The reinforcement learning agent, named ""Archaeos,"" was introduced
into this environment with the sole objective of uncovering and collecting as many artifacts as possible
within a set timeframe.
An unexpected approach we undertook was to integrate elements of surrealism into the agent’s
decision-making process. By incorporating an aspect of randomness inspired by the works of André
Breton, we observed that Archaeos occasionally deviated from the most efficient paths, instead opting
for routes that seemed to be guided by an almost intuition-based logic. This surrealistic deviation led
to the discovery of several artifacts that would have otherwise remained hidden, submerged beneath
layers of digital rubble.
In a bizarre tangent, we also explored the impact of sonic vibrations on the agent’s excavation
efficiency. By exposing Archaeos to a constant, low-frequency hum, allegedly resonating at a
frequency aligned with the supposed vibrational rate of the universe (approximately 432 Hz), we
noted an illogical yet intriguing phenomenon. The agent’s ability to detect hidden artifacts increased
by a margin of 7.32
5
To quantify the performance of Archaeos, we conducted a series of trials across different regions of
Elysium, each with its unique set of challenges and hidden treasures. The results of these trials are
summarized in the following table:
Table 1: Artifact Collection Efficiency Across Different Regions of Elysium

74.19

91.45
Elysian Fields

Further analysis revealed that the efficiency of Archaeos in collecting artifacts was not only dependent
on its training data and the surrealistic elements integrated into its decision-making process but also
on the regional characteristics of Elysium. For instance, the agent performed exceptionally well
in regions with dense mythological histories, such as Valhalla and Atlantis, but faced significant
challenges in areas with less defined historical contexts, like the Elysian Fields.
The experiments also led to an unexpected observation regarding the phenomenon of ""digital echoes.""
In several instances, Archaeos encountered artifacts that seemed to be residual imprints or echoes of
previously excavated items. These digital echoes, while not providing any tangible rewards, served as
markers or clues that significantly aided the agent in uncovering new, hidden artifacts. This discovery
has profound implications for the field of metaverse archaeology, suggesting that even in the digital
realm, the act of excavation can leave behind a form of historical residue that can be leveraged for
future discoveries.
In conclusion, the experiments conducted within the realm of Elysium have not only demonstrated
the viability of using reinforcement learning agents for metaverse archaeology but have also unveiled
a plethora of complex, intriguing phenomena that challenge our conventional understanding of
digital excavation and its potential intersections with the mystical and the surreal. As we continue
to explore the depths of Elysium and refine the capabilities of Archaeos, we are reminded that the
boundaries between the physical and the digital, the historical and the speculative, are far more fluid
and interconnected than previously imagined.

Results
The deployment of our reinforcement learning agent, trained on a corpus of ancient conspiracy
theories, yielded a plethora of intriguing results in the realm of metaverse archaeology. As the
agent navigated the virtual ruins, it began to uncover patterns and structures that defied conventional
understanding of these digital environments. Notably, the agent’s propensity for excavating anomalous
artifacts and relics led to the discovery of a hidden virtual chamber deep within the metaverse, replete
with cryptic symbols and murals that seemed to depict a narrative of interdimensional travel and
ancient civilizations.
Further analysis of the agent’s behavior revealed an unexpected affinity for excavating virtual ruins in
a zigzag pattern, ostensibly influenced by the agent’s training data, which included ancient myths
and legends of serpent-like deities and labyrinthine underworlds. This peculiar excavation strategy
resulted in the uncovering of several previously unknown virtual sites, each containing artifacts that
challenged our current understanding of metaverse archaeology. For instance, the agent discovered a
virtual temple dedicated to a hitherto unknown deity, whose worship seemed to involve the ritualistic
consumption of digital ambrosia and the recitation of cryptic mantras.
The agent’s performance was evaluated using a bespoke metric, which we term ""Parallax Efficiency""
(PE), a measure of the agent’s ability to excavate virtual ruins while navigating the complexities of
the metaverse. The results, presented in Table 2, demonstrate a significant improvement in PE over
the course of the agent’s training, with a notable spike in efficiency corresponding to the introduction
of a novel reward function based on the agent’s ability to uncover anomalous artifacts.

Moreover, the agent’s excavation activities seemed to have a profound impact on the metaverse
environment, resulting in the emergence of novel virtual flora and fauna that seemed to be drawn
to the anomalous artifacts uncovered by the agent. This phenomenon, which we term ""Digital
Symbiosis,"" has significant implications for our understanding of the metaverse as a dynamic, evolving
environment that is capable of responding to the actions of agents and users. The observation of
Digital Symbiosis also led to a tangential investigation into the potential applications of metaverse
archaeology in the field of digital conservation, where the agent’s ability to excavate and preserve
virtual artifacts could be leveraged to protect endangered virtual species and ecosystems.
In addition to these findings, the agent’s training data, comprised of ancient conspiracy theories,
seemed to exert a curious influence on the agent’s behavior, leading it to excavate virtual ruins
in accordance with the principles of sacred geometry and mystical numerology. This unexpected
convergence of ancient mysticism and modern reinforcement learning has significant implications for
our understanding of the complex interplay between human culture, technology, and the metaverse.
The incorporation of mystical and esoteric knowledge into the agent’s training data also resulted in the
emergence of a novel form of ""Virtual Gnosticism,"" where the agent’s excavations seemed to reveal
hidden truths and forbidden knowledge that challenged the dominant narratives of the metaverse.
The results of this study demonstrate the potential of metaverse archaeology as a field of research,
highlighting the complex interplay between human culture, technology, and the metaverse. The use
of reinforcement learning agents trained on ancient conspiracy theories has proven to be a fruitful
approach, yielding novel insights and discoveries that challenge our current understanding of the
metaverse. As we continue to explore the vast expanse of the metaverse, it is likely that we will
uncover even more surprising and unexpected phenomena, each with its own unique implications for
our understanding of this complex and evolving environment. The future of metaverse archaeology
holds much promise, and it is our hope that this research will serve as a foundation for further studies
into the mysteries and wonders of the metaverse.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our research endeavors to excavate virtual ruins within the metaverse have yielded a
plethora of fascinating and unconventional insights, effectively blurring the lines between the physical
and digital realms. By leveraging a reinforcement learning agent trained on ancient conspiracy
theories, we have been able to unearth novel patterns and connections that have significant implications
for the field of metaverse archaeology. The incorporation of seemingly disparate concepts, such as
the alignment of celestial bodies and the cryptic symbolism of ancient mythologies, has proven to be
a crucial factor in the agent’s ability to navigate and interpret the virtual landscape.
One of the most striking aspects of our research has been the emergence of a peculiar phenomenon,
wherein the agent appears to be developing its own brand of conspiracy theories, weaving together
disparate threads of information to form elaborate narratives that are at once fantastical and strangely
compelling. This has led us to propose the notion of a ""conspiracy theory feedback loop,"" wherein
the agent’s own theorizing becomes a self-reinforcing mechanism, driving the excavation process
forward in unexpected and unconventional ways.
Furthermore, our research has also highlighted the importance of considering the role of ""digital
artifacts"" in the metaverse, which can take the form of abandoned avatars, forgotten chat logs, and
other remnants of digital activity. These artifacts, we argue, hold significant cultural and historical
value, offering a unique window into the evolution of virtual societies and the ways in which they
intersect with the physical world. By analyzing these artifacts through the lens of ancient conspiracy
7
theories, we have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between
technology, culture, and human perception.
In a surprising turn of events, our research has also led us to explore the concept of ""virtual ruination,""
wherein the metaverse itself becomes a kind of archaeological site, with abandoned virtual structures
and landscapes holding secrets and stories that are waiting to be uncovered. This has involved the
development of novel methodologies for excavating and interpreting virtual ruins, including the use
of machine learning algorithms to reconstruct damaged or degraded digital artifacts. The results of
these efforts have been nothing short of astonishing, revealing hidden patterns and codes that underlie
the very fabric of the metaverse.
Perhaps most unexpectedly, our research has also led us to consider the potential applications of
metaverse archaeology in the realm of ""digital urban planning,"" wherein the insights and method-
ologies developed through our research can be used to inform the design and development of more
sustainable, equitable, and culturally rich virtual cities. By examining the ways in which virtual
societies evolve and interact with their environments, we can gain a deeper understanding of the
complex interplay between technology, culture, and human experience, and develop more effective
strategies for creating vibrant, thriving virtual communities.
In addition, our findings have significant implications for the field of ""conspiracy theory studies,""
highlighting the importance of considering the role of technology and digital media in the dissemi-
nation and evolution of conspiracy theories. By examining the ways in which conspiracy theories
are constructed, disseminated, and negotiated within virtual communities, we can gain a deeper
understanding of the complex social and cultural dynamics that underlie these phenomena, and
develop more effective strategies for mitigating their potential harms.
Ultimately, our research demonstrates the vast potential of metaverse archaeology as a field of study,
one that holds significant promise for revealing new insights into the complex interplay between
technology, culture, and human experience. As we continue to explore the virtual ruins of the
metaverse, we may yet uncover secrets and stories that challenge our understanding of the world and
our place within it, and shed new light on the mysterious, often inexplicable forces that shape our
reality. The alignment of the stars, the whispers of ancient mythologies, and the cryptic symbolism
of forgotten artifacts all hold secrets and stories that are waiting to be uncovered, and it is our hope
that this research will serve as a catalyst for further exploration and discovery in the vast, uncharted
expanse of the metaverse.

P063.pdf,"Representation Transferability in Neural Networks
Across Datasets and Tasks
Abstract
Deep neural networks, which are built from multiple layers with hierarchical
distributed representations, tend to learn low-level features in their initial layers
and shift to high-level features in subsequent layers. Transfer learning, multi-task
learning, and continual learning paradigms leverage this hierarchical distributed
representation to share knowledge across different datasets and tasks. This paper
studies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across
several datasets and tasks, noting interesting empirical observations.
1
Introduction
Deep networks, constructed with multiple layers and hierarchical distributed representations, learn
low-level features in initial layers and shift to high-level features as the network becomes deeper.
Generic hierarchical distributed representations allow for the sharing of knowledge across datasets
and tasks in paradigms such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, and continual learning. In
transfer learning, for example, the transfer of low-level features from one dataset to another can
boost performance on the target task when data is limited, provided that the datasets are related.
Transferring high-level features, with the learning of low-level features, can also be useful when the
tasks are similar but the data distributions differ slightly.
This paper studies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across several
datasets and tasks, and reports some interesting observations. First, we demonstrate that the layer-wise
transferability between datasets or tasks can be non-symmetric, with features learned from a source
dataset being more relevant to a target dataset, despite similar sizes. Secondly, the characteristics of
the datasets or tasks and their relationship have a greater effect on the layer-wise transferability of
representations than factors such as the network architecture. Third, we propose that the layer-wise
transferability of representations can be a proxy for measuring task relatedness. These observations
emphasize the importance of curriculum methods and structured approaches to designing systems
for multiple tasks that maximize knowledge transfer and minimize interference between datasets or
tasks.

Citation Networks
2.1
Methods
We have produced a citation graph using citation data from NeurIPS papers from SemanticScholar,
and institutional information about authors from AMiner. From the NeurIPS website, we first gathered
all paper titles from 2012 to 2021. We then mapped the paper titles to their Semantic Scholar paper
IDs using the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API. Unmatched papers were manually
searched for, with all but one being found in the Semantic Scholar database. For each paper, we used
the S2AG API to identify authors, and the authors of their references.
We used AMiner to identify institutional information for each author. The 9460 NeurIPS papers
contain 135,941 authors, with institutions found for 83,515 (61%) of them. Papers lacking author
.
information were removed from our dataset. We then marked institutes automatically by country
name and common cities and regions in China. We supplemented automatic annotations with existing
regional matchings and added 364 additional rules for regional matching. We also removed major
multinational corporate labs. Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from
China, the US, or Europe, or included collaborators from multiple regions, leaving us with 1792
papers. Finally, we calculated the average number and proportion of citations between papers from
each region.
2.2
Results
Our results show how American and Chinese papers fail to cite each other. While 60% of the data set
comes from American papers, they only compose 34% of Chinese citations. American citations of
Chinese papers are even more dramatic, with the 34% of the dataset coming from Chinese papers only
accounting for 9% of American citations. These numbers are even more significant when compared
to American citations of European papers; we found that American institutions cite European papers
more often than Chinese papers despite our dataset containing six times more Chinese papers than
European.
Each region tends to cite its own papers more often: China 21%, the USA 41%, and Europe 14%.
The separation between American and Chinese research is more pronounced than would be expected
based solely on regional preference. American and European research communities demonstrate
similar citation patterns with few citations to Chinese papers. Chinese institutions, on the other hand,
cite both American and European papers less than either of those regions.

Limitations
The results presented here have some limitations. Firstly, while we have labeled the work of any
university located in the United States as American, it is possible that such labs still have close ties to
China, leading to an underestimate of the divide between US and Chinese AI research. Secondly, we
have excluded papers where author information was not available on AMiner, a Chinese company,
and therefore, there could be more Chinese papers in our dataset than we have determined. The 43%
of discarded papers due to missing author information also likely represent a biased sample.
4
Consequences
While American and Chinese researchers publish in the same venues, they represent two parallel
communities with limited impact on each other’s research. This can, partly, be attributed to differing
research interests arising from distinct cultural norms that influence research priorities. For instance,
multi-object tracking is an active area of research in China with large scale benchmarks, whereas,
concerns surrounding misuse of biometric data in North America have led researchers there to avoid
such research. Likewise, US researchers are heavily represented at conferences regarding fairness in
AI, while the Chinese are not.
This separation impacts not only the research topics, but also how they evolve. In addition, abstract
topics or architectures that are popular in one region may not be popular in the other. For example,
PCANet which is a popular image classification architecture has most of its 1200 citations from East
Asian institutions, while Deep Forests has most of its 600 citations from Chinese institutions.
Another limitation is related to differences in the approach to ethics. The North American and Euro-
pean AI communities have begun to publish research on the ethics of AI and have included systems
2
for reviewers to flag ethical concerns and ask authors to provide ethics statements. Engagement
with Chinese researchers in this topic remains limited, even though ethics statements from Chinese
AI institutions show many similarities to western ones. A clear example of this disconnect is the
Provisional Draft of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics where, at the time of initial publication, all the
authors were based in the US or Australia, but none were based in Asia. Although similar statements
exist across regions, disagreements in research practice still arise. One such example is where Duke
University stopped using the Duke-MTMC dataset because researchers had not obtained consent
from the students they collected images from, yet similar datasets like Market-1501 from China
continue to be used.
The divide between these two communities impacts individual researchers, the machine learning
community as a whole, and potentially the societies impacted by AI research, highlighting the need
for a discussion to overcome this barrier.

P025.pdf,"Scene Comprehension Through Image Analysis with
an Extensive Array of Categories and Context at the
Scene Level
Abstract
This research introduces a unique approach to scene parsing that is nonparametric,
which enhances the precision and expands the scope of foreground categories within
images of scenes. Initially, the accuracy of label likelihood at the superpixel level
is improved by combining likelihood scores from multiple probabilistic classifiers.
This method improves classification accuracy and enhances the representation of
categories that are less frequently represented. The second advancement involves
the integration of semantic context into the parsing procedure by utilizing global
label costs. Instead of relying on sets derived from image retrieval, the technique
described assigns a comprehensive likelihood estimate to each label, which is
subsequently incorporated into the overall energy function. The effectiveness
of the system is assessed using two expansive datasets, SIFTflow and LMSun.
The system demonstrates performance that is at the forefront of the field on the
SIFTflow dataset and achieves outcomes that are close to setting new records on
the LMSun dataset.
1
Introduction
The task of scene parsing involves assigning semantic labels to every pixel within an image of a
scene. Algorithms for image parsing attempt to categorize different types of scenes, both indoors and
outdoors, such as a shoreline, a roadway, an urban environment, and an airport. Numerous systems
have been developed to categorize each pixel in an image semantically. A significant obstacle for
image parsing methods is the considerable variability in recognition rates across different types of
classes. Background classes, which usually cover a significant area of the image’s pixels, often have a
uniform look and are identified with great accuracy. Foreground classes, which usually take up fewer
pixels in the image, have changeable forms and might be hidden or set up in various ways. These
kinds of classes represent noticeable parts of the image that frequently grab a viewer’s attention.
However, their recognition rates are often much lower than those of background classes, making
them frequent examples of unsuccessful recognition.
Impressive results have been obtained by parametric scene parsing techniques on datasets with a
limited number of labels. Nevertheless, for considerably bigger datasets with a lot of labels, using
these techniques becomes more challenging because of the increased demands on learning and
optimization.
Nonparametric image parsing techniques have recently been introduced to tackle the growing variety
of scene types and semantic labels effectively. These methods usually begin by reducing the com-
plexity of the problem from individual pixels to superpixels. Initially, a set of images is selected,
consisting of training images that bear the closest visual resemblance to the image being queried.
The potential labels for a specific image are limited to those found in the selected set of images.
Subsequently, the probability scores for the classification of superpixels are determined by matching
visual characteristics. Ultimately, context is applied by reducing an energy function that includes both
the expense of the data and information on how often classes appear together in nearby superpixels.
.
A shared difficulty encountered by nonparametric parsing methods is the phase of image retrieval.
Even though image retrieval helps narrow down the number of labels to think about, it’s seen as a
very important step in the process. There’s no opportunity to correct the mistake if the correct labels
are not among the images that were retrieved. It has been reported that mistakes in retrieval are the
main reason for most unsuccessful cases.
A novel nonparametric image parsing algorithm is proposed in this work, aiming for enhanced
overall precision and improved identification rates for classes that are less commonly represented. An
efficient system is developed that can adapt to an ever-growing quantity of labels. The contributions
made are outlined as follows:
1. Superpixel label likelihood scores are improved by merging classifiers. The system merges
the output probabilities from several classification models to generate a more equitable score for
each label at every superpixel. The weights for merging the scores are determined by employing a
likelihood normalization technique on the training set in an automated manner. 2. Semantic context is
integrated within a probabilistic structure. To prevent the removal of important labels that cannot be
retrieved later, a retrieval set is not structured. Instead, label costs are utilized, which are determined
from the global contextual relationships of labels in analogous scenes, to obtain enhanced parsing
outcomes.
The system developed achieves top-tier per-pixel recognition accuracy on two extensive datasets:
SIFTflow, which includes 2688 images with 33 labels, and LMSun, which has 45576 images with
232 labels.
2
Related Work
Several techniques for scene parsing, both parametric and nonparametric, have been suggested. The
nonparametric systems that try to cover a wide range of semantic classes are very similar to the
method. Different methods are used to improve the overall effectiveness of nonparametric parsing.
The authors merge region-parsing with outputs from per-exemplar SVM detectors. Object masks
are transferred by per-exemplar detectors into the test image for segmentation. Their method greatly
improves overall accuracy, but it requires a lot of computer power. It’s hard to scale because data
terms need to be calibrated using a batch of fine training in a leave-one-out way, which is hard to do.
Superpixels from rare classes are specifically added to the retrieval set to make them more visible.
The authors filter the list of labels for a test image by doing an image retrieval step, and query time
is used to add more samples to rare classes. The way superpixels are classified, how rare classes
are recognized, and how semantic context is applied are all different in this system. By combining
classification costs from different contextual models, a more balanced set of label costs is produced,
which promotes the representation of foreground classes. Instead of using image retrieval, global
label costs are used in the inference step.
The value of semantic context has been thoroughly investigated in numerous visual recognition
algorithms. Context has been employed to enhance the overall labeling performance through a
feedback mechanism in nonparametric scene parsing systems. Initial labeling of superpixels in a
query image is utilized to modify the training set by adjusting for recognized background classes,
thereby enhancing the visibility of uncommon classes. The objective is to enhance the image retrieval
set by reintroducing segments of uncommon classes. A semantic global descriptor is generated.
Image retrieval is enhanced by merging the semantic descriptor with the visual descriptors. Context
is added by creating global and local context descriptors based on classification likelihood maps. The
method described differs from these methods as it does not employ context at each superpixel when
calculating a global context descriptor. Instead, contextual information across the entire image is
taken into account.
Contextually relevant outcomes are produced by deducing label correlations in comparable scene
images. Additionally, there is no retrieval set that needs to be enriched. Rather, the global context is
structured within a probabilistic framework, where label costs are calculated across the whole image.
Furthermore, the global context is executed in real time without any preliminary training. Another
method of image parsing that doesn’t use retrieval sets is where image labeling is done by moving
annotations from a graph of patch matches across image sets. But this method needs a lot of memory,
which makes it hard to scale for big datasets.
2
The presented method draws inspiration from the combination of classifier techniques in machine
learning, which have demonstrated the ability to enhance the capabilities of individual classifiers.
Several fusion methods have been effectively applied in various fields of computer vision, including
detecting faces, annotating images with multiple labels, tracking objects, and recognizing characters.
Nonetheless, the classifiers that make up these systems and the ways they are combined are very
different from the framework, and the other methods have only been tested on small datasets.

Baseline Parsing Pipeline
This section provides a summary of the basic image parsing system, which is composed of three
stages: feature extraction, label likelihood estimation at superpixels, and inference.
Afterward, contributions are presented: enhancing likelihoods at superpixels and calculating label
costs for global context at the scene level.
3.1
Segmentation and Feature Extraction
To reduce the complexity of the task, the image is partitioned into superpixels. Extraction of
superpixels from images begins by employing an efficient graph-based method. For each superpixel,
20 distinct types of local features are extracted to characterize its shape, appearance, texture, color, and
position, adhering to established methods. In addition to these features, Fisher Vector (FV) descriptors
are extracted at each superpixel using an established library. Computation of 128-dimensional dense
SIFT feature descriptors is performed on five different patch sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 30). A dictionary
comprising 1024 words is constructed. Subsequently, the FV descriptors are retrieved and Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to decrease their dimensionality to 512. Each superpixel is
represented by a feature vector that has 2202 dimensions.
3.2
Label Likelihood Estimation
The features obtained in the prior stage are utilized to determine label probabilities for each superpixel.
Unlike conventional approaches, the possible labels for a test image are not restricted. Instead, the
data term for the likelihood of each class label c C is computed, where C represents the total number
of classes in the dataset. The normalized cost D(l<sub>si</sub> = c|s<sub>i</sub>) of assigning
label c to superpixel s<sub>i</sub> is given by:
D(lsi = c|si) = 1 −
1
1 + e−Lunbal(si,c)
(1)
where L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the log-likelihood ratio score of label c, given by
L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) = 1/2 log(P(s<sub>i</sub>|c)/P(s<sub>i</sub>|¬c)), where
¬c = C c is the set of all labels except c, and P(s<sub>i</sub>|c) is the likelihood of superpixel
s<sub>i</sub> given c. A boosted decision tree (BDT) model is trained to obtain the label likelihoods
L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c). For implementation, a publicly accessible boostDT library
is utilized. During this phase, the BDT model is trained using every superpixel in the training set,
which constitutes an imbalanced distribution of class labels C.
3.3
Smoothing and Inference
The optimization challenge is formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to determine
the ultimate labeling L through Markov Random Field (MRF) inference. Using only the estimated
likelihoods from the preceding section to categorize superpixels leads to imprecise classifications.
Incorporating a smoothing term V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>, l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) into
the MRF energy function aims to address this problem by penalizing adjacent superpixels with
semantically incongruous labels. The goal is to minimize the following energy function:
E(L) =
X
si∈S
D(lsi = c|si) + λ
X
(i,j)∈A
V (lsi, lsj)
(2)
3
where A represents the set of neighboring superpixel indices and V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>,
l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) denotes the penalty for assigning labels l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>
and l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub> to two adjacent pixels, calculated from occurrences in the training
set combined with the constant Potts model following established methods. is the smoothing constant.
Inference is conducted using the -expansion method with established code.

Improving Superpixel Label Costs
Although foreground objects typically stand out the most in a picture of a scene, parsing algorithms
frequently misclassify them. For instance, in an image of a city street, a person would usually first
spot the individuals, signs, and vehicles before they would see the structures and the street. However,
because of two primary factors, scene parsing algorithms frequently misclassify foreground regions
as belonging to the surrounding background. Initially, in the superpixel classification phase, any
classifier would naturally prefer classes that are more prevalent to reduce the overall training error.
Secondly, during the MRF smoothing phase, a lot of the superpixels that were accurately identified as
foreground objects are smoothed out by the background pixels around them.
It is suggested that the label likelihood score at each superpixel be improved to obtain a more precise
parsing output. Various classifiers are designed that provide supplementary information regarding
the data. Subsequently, all the developed models are merged to produce a unified conclusion. An
overview of the method for merging classifiers is displayed in Figure 1. During the testing phase,
the label likelihood scores from all the BDT models are combined to generate the final scores for
superpixels.
4.1
Fusing Classifiers
The proposed method is inspired by ensemble classifier methods, which train several classifiers and
merge them to enhance decision-making. These methods are especially helpful when the classifiers
are distinct. In other words, the decrease in error is connected to the lack of correlation between the
models that were trained. This means that the total error is decreased if the classifiers misclassify
different data points. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that for large datasets, dividing the
training set yields superior results compared to dividing the feature space.
It has been observed that the classification error for a particular class is correlated with the average
number of pixels it covers in the scene images, as indicated by the blue line in Figure 2. This is in
line with what earlier methods found, which is that the rate of classification error is related to how
often classes show up in the training set. However, it goes beyond that by taking into account how
often the classes appear at the image level, which is meant to solve the problem of less-represented
classes being smoothed out by a background class that is nearby.
To achieve this, three BDT models are trained using the following training data criteria: (1) a balanced
subsample of all classes C in the dataset, (2) a balanced subsample of classes that occupy an average
of less than z
The goal of these decisions is to lessen the correlation between the trained BDT models, as seen in
Figure 2. The balanced classifiers are able to correctly identify some of the less-represented classes,
but they make more mistakes on the more-represented classes. The unbalanced classifier, on the
other hand, mostly misclassifies the less-represented classes. Combining the likelihoods from all
the classifiers leads to an improved overall decision that enhances the representation of all classes
(Figure 1). It was noticed that the addition of more classifiers did not enhance performance for any of
the datasets.
The ultimate expense of allocating a label c to a superpixel s<sub>i</sub> can subsequently be
expressed as the amalgamation of the likelihood scores of all classifiers:
D(lsi = c|si) = 1 −
1
1 + e−Lcomb(si,c)
(3)
where L<sub>comb</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) represents the combined likelihood score obtained by
the weighted sum of the scores from all classifiers:
4
Lcomb(si, c) =
X
j=1,2,3,4
wj(c)Lj(si, c)
(4)
where L<sub>j</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the score from the j<sup>th</sup> classifier, and
w<sub>j</sub>(c) is the normalized weight of the likelihood score of class c in the j<sup>th</sup>
classifier.

where |C<sub>j</sub>| denotes the quantity of classes encompassed by the j<sup>th</sup> classifier
and not covered by any other classifier with a fewer number of classes.
The normalized weight w<sub>j</sub>(c) of class c can then be computed as: w<sub>j</sub>(c) =
~w<sub>j</sub>(c) / <sub>j=1,2,3,4</sub>(~w<sub>j</sub>(c)). Normalizing the output likelihoods
in this way improves the likelihood that all classifiers will be taken into account in the outcome, with
a focus on classes that are less represented.

Scene-Level Global Context
When working with scene parsing challenges, including the scene’s semantics in the labeling process
is beneficial. For example, if a scene is known to be a beach scene, labels such as sea, sand, and sky
are expected to be found with a much greater probability than labels like car, building, or fence. The
initial labeling results of a test image are used in estimating the likelihoods of all labels c C. The
likelihoods are estimated globally over an image, i.e., there is a unique cost per label per image. The
global label costs are then incorporated into a subsequent MRF inference stage to enhance the results.
The presented method, in contrast to previous methods, does not restrict the number of labels to
those found in the retrieval set. Instead, it utilizes the set to calculate the likelihood of class labels
in a k-nn manner. The likelihoods are normalized by counts over the entire dataset and smoothed
to provide an opportunity for labels not present in the retrieval set. The likelihoods are also used in
MRF optimization, not for reducing the number of labels.
5.1
Context-Aware Global Label Costs
It is proposed that semantic context be incorporated by using label statistics instead of global visual
features. The reasoning behind this decision is that sorting by global visual characteristics often
doesn’t find images that are similar at the scene level. For instance, a highway scene might be
mistaken for a beach scene if road pixels are incorrectly classified as sand. Nonetheless, when given a
reasonably accurate initial labeling, sorting by label statistics finds images that are more semantically
related. This helps to eliminate outlier labels and find labels that are absent in a scene.
For a given test image I, minimizing the energy function in equation 2 produces an initial labeling
L of the superpixels in the image. If C is the total number of classes in the dataset, let T C be the
set of unique labels which appear in L, i.e. T = t | s<sub>i</sub> : l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t,
where s<sub>i</sub> is a superpixel with index i in the test image, and l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>
is the label of s<sub>i</sub>. Semantic context is exploited in a probabilistic framework, where the
conditional distribution P(c|T) is modeled over class labeling C given the initial global labeling of an
image T. P(c|T) c C is computed in a K-nn fashion:
P(c|T) = 1 + n(c, KT )
n(c, S)
1 + n(¬c, KT )
|S|
(6)
5
where K<sub>T</sub> is the K-neighborhood of initial labeling T, n(c, X) is the number of superpixels
with label c in X, n(¬c, X) is the number of superpixels with all labels except c in X, and |S| is the
total number of superpixels in the training set. The likelihoods are normalized and a smoothing
constant of value 1 is added.
To obtain the neighborhood K<sub>T</sub>, training images are ranked by their distance to the
query image. The distance between two images is determined by the weighted size of the intersection
of their class labels, which intuitively shows that the neighbors of T are images that share many labels
with those in T. A different weight is assigned to each class in T in a manner that gives preference to
classes that are less represented.
The algorithm operates in three stages, as depicted in Figure 3. It begins by (1) assigning a weight
<sub>t</sub> to each class t T, which is inversely proportional to the number of superpixels in the
test image with label t: <sub>t</sub> = 1 - n(t,I)/|I|, where n(t, I) is the number of superpixels in the
test image with label l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t, and |I| is the total number of superpixels in the
image. Then, (2) training images are ranked by the weighted size of intersection of their class labels
with the test image. Finally, (3) the global label likelihood L<sub>global</sub>(c) = P(c|T) of each
label c C is computed using equation 6.
Calculating the label costs is performed in real-time for a query image, without the need for any
offline batch training. The method enhances the overall precision by utilizing solely the true labels of
training images, without incorporating any global visual characteristics.
5.2
Inference with Label Costs
Once the likelihoods L<sub>global</sub>(c) of each class c C are obtained, a label cost H(c) =
-log(L<sub>global</sub>(c)) can be defined. The final energy function becomes:
E(L) =
X
si∈S
D(lsi = c|si) + λ
X
(i,j)∈A
V (lsi, lsj) +
X
c∈C
H(c)δ(c)
(7)
where (c) is the indicator function of label c:
δ(c) =
1
if ∃si : lsi = c
0
otherwise
(8)
Equation 7 is solved using -expansion with the extension method to optimize label costs. Optimizing
the energy function in equation 7 effectively minimizes the number of unique labels in a test image to
those with low label costs, i.e., those most relevant to the scene.
6
Experiments
The experiments were conducted on two extensive datasets: SIFTflow and LMSun. SIFTflow consists
of 2,488 training images and 200 test images. All images are of outdoor scenes, sized 256x256 with
33 labels. LMSun includes both indoor and outdoor scenes, with a total of 45,676 training images
and 500 test images. Image sizes range from 256x256 to 800x600 pixels with 232 labels.
The same evaluation metrics and train/test splits as in previous methods are employed. The per-pixel
accuracy (the percentage of pixels in test images that were correctly labeled) and per-class recognition
rate (the average of per-pixel accuracies of all classes) are reported. The following variants of the
system are evaluated: (i) baseline, as described in section 3, (ii) baseline (with balanced BDT), which
is the baseline approach using a balanced classifier, (iii) baseline + FC (NL fusion), which is the
baseline in addition to the fusing classifiers with normalized-likelihood (NL) weights in section 4, and
(iv) full, which is baseline + fusing classifiers + global costs. To show the effectiveness of the fusion
method (section 4.2), the results of (v) baseline + FC (average fusion), which is fusing classifiers by
averaging their likelihoods, and (vi) baseline + FC (median fusion), which is fusing classifiers by
taking the median of their likelihoods are reported. Results of (vii) full (without FV), which is the
full system without using the Fisher Vector features are also reported.

x = 5 is fixed (section 4.1), a value that was obtained through empirical evaluation on a small subset
of the training set.

The results are compared with state-of-the-art methods on SIFTflow in Table 1. K = 64 top-ranked
training images have been set for computing the global context likelihoods (section 5.1). The full

Table 2 compares the performance of the same variants of the system with the state-of-the-art methods
on the large-scale LMSun dataset. LMSun is more challenging than SIFTflow in terms of the number
of images, the number of classes, and the presence of both indoor and outdoor scenes. Accordingly,
a larger value of K = 200 in equation 6 is used. The method achieves near-record performance in
per-pixel accuracy (61.2

The performance of the system is analyzed when varying the number of trees T for training the BDT
model (section 4.1), and the number of top training images K in the global label costs (section 5.1).
Figure 4 shows the per-pixel accuracy (on the y-axis) and the per-class accuracy (on the x-axis) as a
function of T for a variety of K’s. Increasing the value of T generally produces better classification
models that better describe the training data. At T 400, performance levels off. As shown, the
global label costs consistently improve the performance over the baseline method with no global
context. Using more training images (higher K) improves the performance through considering more
semantically relevant scene images. However, performance starts to decrease for very high values of
K (e.g., K = 1000) as more noisy images start to be added.
7
Figure 5 shows the per-class recognition rate for the baseline, combined classifiers, and the full
system on SIFTflow. The fusing classifiers technique produces more balanced likelihood scores that
cover a wider range of classes. The semantic context step removes outlier labels and recovers missing
labels, which improves the recognition rates of both common and rare classes. Recovered classes
include field, grass, bridge, and sign. Failure cases include extremely rare classes, e.g. cow, bird,
desert, and moon.
6.2
Running Time
The runtime performance was analyzed for both SIFTflow and LMSun (without feature extraction)
on a four-core 2.84GHz CPU with 32GB of RAM without code optimization. For the SIFTflow
dataset, training the classifier takes an average of 15 minutes per class. The training process is run
in parallel. The training time highly depends on the feature dimensionality. At test time, superpixel
classification is efficient, with an average of 1 second per image. Computing global label costs takes
3 seconds. Finally, MRF inference takes less than one second. MRF inference is run twice for the
full pipeline. LMSun is much larger than SIFTflow. It takes 3 hours for training the classifier, less
than a minute for superpixel classification per image, less than 1 minute for MRF inference, and 2
minutes for global label cost computation.
6.3
Discussion
The presented scene parsing method is generally scalable as it does not require any offline training
in a batch fashion. However, the time required for training a BDT classifier increases linearly with
increasing the number of data points. This is challenging with large datasets like LMSun. Randomly
subsampling the dataset has a negative impact on the overall precision of the classification results.
Alternative approaches of mining discriminative data points that better describe each class are planned
to be investigated. The system still faces challenges in trying to recognize very less-represented
classes in the dataset (e.g., bird, cow, and moon). This could be handled via better contextual models
per query image.
7
Conclusion
A novel scene parsing algorithm has been presented that enhances the overall labeling precision,
without neglecting foreground classes that are significant to human viewers. By merging likelihood
scores from various classification models, the strengths of individual models have been successfully
amplified, thus enhancing both the per-pixel and per-class accuracy. To prevent the removal of
accurate labels through image retrieval, global context has been integrated into the parsing process
using a probabilistic framework. The energy function has been expanded to incorporate global label
costs that produce a more semantically relevant parsing output. Experiments have demonstrated
the superior performance of the system on the SIFTflow dataset and comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on the LMSun dataset.

Introduction
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities
in areas such as question answering and text generation. One promising application of LLMs
is in aiding the scientific peer-review process. However, the idea of using LLMs in peer review
is contentious and fraught with potential issues. LLMs can hallucinate, exhibit biases, and may
compromise the fairness of the peer-review process. Despite these potential issues, LLMs may serve
as useful analytical tools to scrutinize manuscripts and identify possible weaknesses or inaccuracies
that need addressing.
In this study, we take the first steps towards harnessing the power of LLMs in the application of
conference peer review. We conduct an experiment at a premier conference in the field of machine
learning. While the wider ethical implications and appropriate use cases of LLMs remain unclear and
must be a larger community discussion, here, we evaluate a relatively clear-cut and low-risk use case:
vetting paper submissions against submission standards, with results shown only to the authors.
Specifically, the peer-review process requires authors to submit a checklist appended to their
manuscripts. Such author checklists, utilized in as well as in other peer-review venues, contain
a set of questions designed to ensure that authors follow appropriate research and manuscript prepa-
ration practices. The Paper Checklist is a series of yes/no questions that help authors check if their
work meets reproducibility, transparency, and ethical research standards expected for papers. The
checklist is a critical component in maintaining standards of research presented at the conference.
Adhering to the guidelines outlined by these checklists helps authors avoid mistakes that could lead
to rejection during peer review.
We deploy and evaluate a Checklist Assistant powered by LLMs. This assistant scrutinizes au-
thors2019 responses to the checklist, proposing enhancements for submissions to meet the confer-
ence2019s requirements. To prevent any potential bias in the review process, we confine its usage
exclusively to the authors of papers, so the checklist assistant is not accessible to reviewers. We then
systematically evaluate the benefits and risks of LLMs by conducting a structured study to understand
if LLMs can enhance research quality and improve efficiency by helping authors understand if their
work meets research standards. Specifically, we administered surveys both before and after use of
the Checklist Assistant asking authors about their expectations for and perceptions of the tool. We
.
received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey, 234 submissions the the Checklist Assistant and 78
responses to the post-usage survey. Our main findings are as follows:
(1) Authors generally reported that the LLM-assisted checklist review was a valuable enhancement to
the paper submission process.
• The majority of surveyed authors reported a positive experience using the LLM assistant.
After using the assistant, over 70
• Authors 2019 expectations of the assistant 2019s effectiveness were even more positive
before using it than their assessments after actually using it (Section 4.1.3).
• Among the main issues reported by authors in qualitative feedback, the most frequently cited
were inaccuracy (20/52 respondents) and that the LLM was too strict in its requirements
(14/52 respon- dents) (Section 4.1.4).
(2) While changes in paper submissions cannot be causally attributed to use of the checklist verifi-
cation assistant, we find qualitative evidence that the checklist review meaningfully helped some
authors to improve their submissions.
• Analysis of the content of LLM feedback to authors indicates that the LLM provided
granular feedback to authors, generally giving 4-6 distinct and specific points of feedback
per question across the 15 questions (Section 4.2.1).
• Survey responses reflect that some authors made meaningful changes to their submissions
201435 survey respondents described specific modifications they would make to their
submissions in response to the Checklist Assistant (Section 4.2.2).
• In 40 instances, authors submitted their paper twice to the checklist verifier (accounting for
80 total paper submissions.) Between these two submissions, authors tended to increase the
length of their checklist justifications significantly, suggesting that they may have added
content in response to LLM feedback (Section 4.2.3).
Finally, we investigate how LLM-based tools can be easily manipulated 2013 specifically, we find
that with AI- assisted re-writing of the justifications, an adversarial author can make the Checklist
Assistant significantly more lenient (Section 5.1).
In summary, the majority of authors found LLM assistance to be beneficial, highlighting the significant
potential of LLMs to enhance scientific workflows 2014 whether by serving as direct assistants to
authors or helping journals and conferences verify guideline compliance. However, our findings also
underscore that LLMs cannot fully replace human expertise in these contexts. A notable portion of
users encountered inaccuracies, and the models were also vulnerable to adversarial manipulation.

Related work
Language models have been used in the scientific peer review process for over a decade. The primary
application so far has been in assigning reviewers to papers. Here, a language model first computes
a 201csimilarity score 201d between every reviewer-paper pair, based on the text of the submitted
paper and the text of the reviewer2019s previously published papers. A higher value of the similarity
score indicates that the language model considers this reviewer to have a higher expertise for this
paper. Given these similarity scores, reviewers are then assigned to papers using an optimization
routine that maximizes the similarity scores of the assigned reviewer-paper pairs.
There have been recent works that design or use LLMs to write the entire review of papers. The
outcome measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the LLM- generated reviews are based on
ratings sourced from authors or other researchers. It is not entirely clear how these ratings translate to
meeting the objectives of peer review in practice namely that of identifying errors, choosing better
papers, and providing useful feedback to authors. Moreover, it is also known that evaluation of
peer reviews themselves are fraught with biases, and the aggregate effect of such biases on these
evaluations of reviews is not clear. Our work focuses on a more concrete task in reviewing papers
than generating an end-to-end review, namely validating that papers meet criteria specified in an
3
Author Checklist. Moreover, we evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in the setting of an actual peer review
conference.
Recent work also investigates whether LLMs can identify errors in papers and shows promising
initial results. The paper constructs a set of short papers with deliberately inserted errors and asks
LLMs to identify errors. GPT-4 does identify the error more than half the time. Another experiment
described asks GPT-4 to identify deliberately inserted errors in three full papers. It successfully and
consis- tently does so on one paper, partially and occasionally on a second paper, and is consistently
unsuccessful on the third. Note that in both experiments, the prompts specifically asked the LLM to
find errors rather than generically asking the LLM to review the paper. Moreover, both experiments
had small sample sizes in terms of the number of papers. In another set of experiments presented,
evaluated the ability of large language models (LLMs) to compare the 201cstrength201d of results
between papers, mirroring the goals of conferences and journals in selecting 2018better 2019 papers.
The experiment consisted of creating 10 pairs of abstracts, where one abstract in each pair was
made 2018 clearly 2019 and objectively stronger than the other. To simulate diverse, yet irrelevant
conditions, the language of the abstracts was deliberately varied. In this test, GPT-4 performed no
better than random chance in identifying the stronger abstract, underscoring that while LLMs may
excel at some complex tasks like scientific error identification, they often struggle with seemingly
simpler tasks.
The papers investigate the performance of LLMs in evaluating checklist compliance. These studies,
however, were retrospective studies of published papers, whereas our work is deployed live associated
to a peer-review venue and helps authors improve their checklist compliance before they make their
submission.
Recent work has highlighted the prevalence of the use of LLMs both in preparation of scientific paper
manuscripts and in the generation of scientific peer reviews. For example, estimates that as of January

checklists are thoroughly answered. Our platform interfaced with a third-party LLM (GPT-4 from
OpenAI), using simple prompt engineering with these hyper-parameters: temperature = 1, topp = 1,
and n = 1. For each checklist question, the LLM is provided with the author2019s checklist response
and justification, alongside the complete paper and any appendices. The LLM2019s role is to assess
the accuracy and thoroughness of each response and justification, offering targeted suggestions for
improvement. Each checklist item is treated as an individual task, i.e., an API call with only one
question, its answer and justification by the author, and the paper and appendices. The API call
returns a review and score for the submitted question.
Figure 1 illustrates examples of feedback provided by the Checklist Assistant for two different papers.
In these examples, green indicates that the tool found 201cno significant concerns201d, while orange
signals 201cneeds improvement201d with the Paper Checklist standards. Authors are encouraged to
carefully review any orange feedback, validate the identified issues, and make the necessary revisions
to align with the checklist requirements.
3.1
Deployment
We deployed the Checklist Assistant on Codabench.org. We configured 15 Google Cloud CPU
workers, integrated with Codabench, to handle multiple paper submissions concurrently. The bulk of
the computations were carried out by the LLM third-party software (GPT-4 from OpenAI) via API
calls (one call per question, and additional calls in case of failure).
Participation was fully voluntary, and participants were recruited through a blog post that was released
8 days before the abstract submission deadline. Interested participants were asked to register though
a Google form. Participants who submitted registration requests through the Google form were then
given access to the Assistant on the Codabench platform. The submissions were entirely optional and
completely separate from the paper submission system and the review process. The papers had to be
formatted as specified in the call for papers (complete with appendices and checklist). Information
provided in external links was not taken into account by the assistant. We asked submitters to fill out
4
the checklist to the best of their abilities. Submissions made via the Codabench landing page were
processed as follows:
Checklist Assistant: The paper was parsed using a PDF-to-text parser, then screened for any problems
such as the format of the paper or checklist, etc. Each answered question in the checklist was
processed by an LLM using an API.
Result Compilation: LLM responses were combined for all questions and formatted in an HTML
document with proper colors and structure for readability and user-friendliness.
We encountered several parsing issues with both paper texts and checklists. Initially, our parser
struggled with subsections and titles, prompting code improvements to handle sections accurately.
Checklist parsing also faced issues due to spacing and incomplete checklists, which we addressed by
refining the code. Special characters, especially merged letters like 201cfi 201d and 201cfl 201d in
the submitted PDFs required further parsing updates.
3.2
Prompt engineering
In this section we discuss design of a prompt given to the LLM, tasked to behave as Checklist
Assistant. We provide the full prompt in Appendix B.
While preparing the Checklist Assistant, we experimented with various prompt styles. Tuning was
carried out using a dozen papers. Some checklists were filled out with our best effort to be correct,
and others included deliberately planted errors to verify robustness and calibrate the scores. We
observed that the LLM performed better with clear, step-by-step instructions.
Our final prompt provided a sequence of instructions covering different aspects of the required
review, designed as follows: first, the context is set by indicating that the paper is under review for
the conference. Next, the main goal is clarified, specifying that the LLM2019s primary task is to
assist the author in responding to the checklist question. The LLM is then directed to review the
author2019s answer and justification, identifying any discrepancies with the paper based on the
specific guidelines of the question. It is instructed to provide itemized, actionable feedback according
to the guidelines, offering suggestions for improvement, with clear examples for responses such as
201cYes, 201d 201cNo, 201d or 201cNA. 201d At the end of the review, the LLM is asked to assign
a score: Score=1 for no issues, Score=0.5 for minor improvements, and Score=0 for critical issues.
Finally, the LLM is provided with the checklist question, the author 2019s answer, justification, the
relevant guidelines, and the paper content.
Before prompt adjustments, LLM responses often mixed the review with the score. To fix this, we
specified that the score should be returned on a separate line at the end of the review. For long papers
exceeding 35 pages (or 15,000 words), we processed only the first 15,000 words and notified authors
with a warning.
We hypothesized that users might find the LLM responses overly strict, vague, and lengthy (which
was indeed later confirmed), so we added prompt instructions like 201cuse 0 score sparingly 201d,
201cprovide itemized, actionable feedback 201d, and 201cfocus on significant improvements. 201d
Although the Checklist Assistant returned scores of 0, 0.5, and 1, we combined the 0 and 0.5 scores
to indicate that improvement was needed, rather than differentiating between two levels of severity
(with red for 0 and orange for 0.5). This decision was made due to concerns that the LLM 2019s
evaluations might be too harsh. User feedback on LLM strictness and other issues is analyzed in
Section 4.
We also tested whether the LLM was consistent in generating answers for reiterations of the same
input. As a sanity check, we test for each question, whether the variation of the output scores for
multiple runs on the same paper is comparable to the variation across papers. We find that the
variation in scores for multiple runs on the same paper is significantly lower than variation across
papers (p < 0.05; based on a one sided permutation test after BH correction) for all but one question.
The only question that had a comparable variance within and across papers was the question on ethics
(Q9; p > 0.4).

3.3
Anonymity, confidentiality, and consent
The authors could retain their anonymity by registering to Codabench with an email that did not
reveal their identity, and by submitting anonymized papers. The papers and LLM outputs were
kept confidential and were not be accessible to reviewers, meta reviewers, and program chairs. It is
important to note that while authors retained ownership of their submissions, the papers were sent to
the API of an LLM service, and treated under their conditions of confidentiality.
This study was approved by the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board (IRB). The
participants gave written documentation of informed consent to participate.

Experiments
In our evaluations, we seek to address two main questions regarding the use of an LLM-automated
Author Checklist Assistant:
(1) Do authors perceive an LLM Author Checklist Assistant as a valuable enhancement to the paper
sub- mission process?
(2) Does the use of an Author Checklist Assistant meaningfully help authors to improve their paper
sub- missions?
In order to understand author experience using the provided Author Checklist Assistant, we surveyed
authors before and after submitting to the Author Checklist Assistant. Additionally, we analyzed the
content and submission patterns of author 2019s checklists and the LLM responses. A summary of our
main findings is given in Section 1. In this subsequent section we provide detailed analyses of survey
responses and usage of the Checklist Assistant. In Section 4.1, we give results on author perception
and experience and in Section 4.2 we analyze changes made by authors to their submissions after
using the Author Checklist Assistant.
4.1
Author Perception and Experience
First, we analyze the authors 2019 usage patterns and perceptions of the Author Checklist Assistant,
as captured through surveys. In Section 4.1.1, we provide an overview of how authors filled out the
checklist and the responses given by the LLM on their checklists. In Section 4.1.2, we detail the
survey methodology used to understand author experience and in Section 4.1.3, we analyze results of
the survey. Finally, in Section 4.1.4, we overview the main challenges identified by authors when
using the Author Checklist Assistant.
4.1.1
Overview of Checklist Usage and Responses
A total of 234 papers, each accompanied by a checklist, were submitted to the assistant. For each
checklist question, authors could respond with Yes, No, NA, or TODO. As illustrated in Figure
2a, most questions received a Yes response, indicating that the authors confirmed their paper met
the corresponding checklist criteria. However, for the questions on Theory, Impacts, Safeguards,
Documentation, Human Subjects, and Risks, a significant portion of authors selected NA. Additionally,
a notable number of authors responded No to the questions on Code and Data, and Error Bars.
In response to the authors 2019 checklists, the LLM provided written feedback, with green indicating
2018No Concerns 2019 and orange indicating 2018Needs improvement 2019. Figure 2b illustrates
the distribution of LLM feedback for each checklist question. For most questions, the majority of
feedback suggested that the checklist or manuscript could be improved. However, for the questions
on Theory, Human Subjects, and Risks, many NA responses were deemed appropriate, leading the
LLM to respond with 2019No Concerns. 2019 This likely reflects the LLM 2019s confidence in
confirming that certain papers did not include theory, human subjects research, or clear broader risks,
making those checklist items irrelevant. In Figure 3, we show the distribution of LLM evaluations
per submission. All submissions received several 2018Needs improvement 2019 ratings, with each
being advised to improve on 8 to 13 out of the 15 checklist questions.

4.1.2
Survey Methodology
To assess authors 2019 perceptions of the usefulness of the Author Checklist Assistant, we conducted
a survey with all participants both at registration (pre-usage) and immediately after using the Author
Checklist Assistant (post-usage). We provide the content of the surveys in Figure 4. Both surveys
contained the same four questions, with the pre-usage survey focusing on expectations and the post-
usage survey on actual experience. Responses were recorded on a four-point Likert scale, ranging
from strongly disagree to strongly agree. In the post-usage survey, we also asked authors to provide
freeform feedback on (1) any changes they planned to make to their paper, and (2) any issues they
encountered while using the Checklist Assistant.
We received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey and 234 papers submitted. However, we received
only 78 responses to the post-usage survey, representing 63 unique participants (due to multiple
submissions for the same paper). While completing the pre-registration survey was mandatory for all
participants, the post-usage survey was optional. As a result, all participants in the post-usage survey
had also completed the pre-registration survey.
4.1.3
Survey Responses
Figure 5 presents the survey responses collected before and after using the checklist verification tool.
We include responses from authors who completed both surveys (n=63). In cases where authors
submitted the survey multiple times for the same paper, we included only the earliest post-usage
response. Including the duplicated responses made a negligible difference, with the proportion of
positive responses changing by less than 0.02 across all questions.
Overall, the majority of authors responded positively regarding their experience with the Checklist
Assis- tant. 70
It is notable that authors were even more positive before using the tool. Comparing pre- and post-
usage responses, there was a statistically significant drop in positive feedback on the 201cUseful 201d
and 201cExcited to Use 201d questions 2014we run a permutation test with 50,0000 permutations to
test whether the difference between proportion of positive responses pre and post-usage is non-zero,
which gives Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values of 0.007 and 0.013 for 201cExcited to Use 201d
and 201cUseful 201d respectively with effect sizes of 22120.23 and 22120.2.
We also assessed the correlation between post-usage survey responses and the number of 2018needs
improve- ment 2019 scores given by the LLM to authors. In Figure 6, we show mean number of
needs improvement scores for authors responding positively or negatively to each survey question.
We find no substantial ef- fect of number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores on survey responses.
This may reflect that the number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores was less important in author
2019s perception than the written content of the LLM 2019s evaluation.
Finally, we examined potential selection bias due to the drop-off in participation in the post-usage
survey by analyzing the pre-usage survey responses across different groups. As noted earlier, only
a portion of the 539 participants who completed the pre-usage survey went on to submit papers
(234 Submitters), and an even smaller group responded to the post-usage survey (78 Post-Usage
Respondents). In Figure 7, we compare the pre-usage survey responses between Submitters and
Non-Submitters, as well as between Post- Usage Respondents and Non-Respondents. No substantial
differences in rates of positive responses were found (using a permutation test for the difference in
mean response, gave p-values of > 0.3 for all questions before multiple testing correction), suggesting
there is no significant selection bias.
4.1.4
Challenges in Usage
In addition to the structured survey responses, 52 out of the 78 post-usage survey submissions
included freeform feedback detailing issues with the Checklist Assistant 2019s usage. We manually
categorized the reported issues from these responses and identified the following primary concerns,
listed in order of decreasing frequency (summarized in Figure 8):
Inaccurate: 20 authors reported that the LLM was inaccurate. Note that it is not possible to tell from
the responses how many inaccuracies participants found in individual questions since the survey did
not ask about individual checklist questions. Many participants noted specific issues, in particular
that the LLM overlooked content in the paper, requesting changes to either the checklist or the paper
7
for elements that the authors believed were already addressed. Additionally, some authors reported
more nuanced accuracy issues. For instance, one author mentioned that the LLM misinterpreted a
201cthought experiment 201d as a real experiment and incorrectly asked for more details about the
experimental setup. Another author reported that the LLM mistakenly assumed human subjects were
involved due to a discussion of 201cinterpretability 201d in the paper.
Too strict: 14 authors reported that the LLM was too strict.
Infeasible to make changes due to page limits: 5 authors felt that they received useful feedback, but it
would not be possible to incorporate due to their papers already being at the page limit.
Too generic: 4 authors reported that the feedback they received was not specific enough to their paper.
Insufficient LLM capabilities: 4 authors complained that the LLM could not handle content over the
(LLM assistant 2019s) page limit or that it was not multimodal and hence ignored figures.
Feedback inconsistent across submissions: 3 authors reported that the LLM feedback changed across
multiple submissions to the server even though the paper and checklist content did not change.
Desire for full paper review: 3 authors reported that they would like feedback on the entire paper, not
just on checklist items.
Bad at theory (mathematical) papers: 2 authors wrote that the LLM seemed bad at theory (mathemati-
cal) papers.
Too verbose: 2 authors wrote that the LLM 2019s feedback was too wordy.
4.2
Changes to Submissions in Response to Feedback
In the following analysis, we integrate an assessment of the LLM 2019s feedback with the authors
2019 checklist answers, to better understand whether the Checklist Assistant helped authors make
concrete and meaningful changes to their papers. In Section 4.2.1, we analyze the types of feedback
given by the LLM to authors. In Section 4.2.2, we overview the changes to their papers that authors
self-reported making in survey responses. Lastly, in Section 4.2.3, we analyze changes made in
multiple submissions of the same paper to the Author Checklist Assistant.
4.2.1
Characterization of LLM Feedback by Question
For authors to make meaningful changes to their papers, the Author Checklist Assistant must provide
concrete feedback. In this section, we analyze the type of feedback given by the Checklist Assistant
to determine whether it is specific to the checklist answers or more generic.
Given the large volume of feedback, we employed an LLM to extract key points from the Checklist
Assistant 2019s responses for each question on the paper checklist and to cluster these points into
overarching categories. Specifically, for each of the 15 questions across the 234 checklist submissions,
we used GPT-4 to identify the main points of feedback provided to authors. We manually inspected
that the main points extracted by GPT-4 matched the long-form feedback on 10 randomly selected
submitted paper checklists and found that GPT-4 was highly accurate in extracting these key feedback
points. We then passed the names and descriptions of these feedback points to GPT-4 to hierarchically
cluster them into broader themes.
The most frequently identified feedback themes for 4 questions are shown in Figure 9. Here are our
key observations from this analysis.
The LLM identified many granular types of feedback within each checklist question. We illustrate with
examples of responses to four questions in Figure 9. For instance, the LLM gave granular feedback
within the Experimental settings/details question on optimizer configuration details, implementation
code availability, and explicit mention of non-traditional experiments.
The LLM tended to provide 4-6 distinct points of feedback per question (for each of the 15 questions).
The LLM is capable of giving concrete and specific feedback for many questions. For example, on
the 201cClaims 201d question, the LLM commented on consistency and precision in documenting
claims on 50 papers, including feedback like matching the abstract and introduction and referencing
appendices. On the 201cCompute resources 201d question the LLM commented specifically on
detailing compute / execution time of methods.
8
The LLM tends to provide some generic boilerplate for each question. The most common category of
feedback for each question is a generic commentary on enhancing general aspects of the question.
There are certain topics that appear across many questions, in particular discussion of limitations and
improved documentation.
The LLM often expands the scope of checklist questions. For example, the LLM brings up repro-
ducibility as a concern in feedback to the code of ethics question and brings up anonymity quite
frequently in the code and data accessibility question.
We provide a full list of the summarized main themes of feedback in Appendix C. In summary, our
analysis of the feedback given by the LLM suggests that the LLM gave concrete and actionable
feedback to authors that they could potentially use to modify their paper submissions. Our analysis
also suggests that a more detailed checklist could be developed to provide more granular feedback,
based on the rubrics covered by the Author Checklist Assistant. Such a detailed checklist could be
processed automatically by an LLM to systematically identify specific, commonly overlooked issues
in scientific papers and flag concrete issues for authors to resolve.
4.2.2
Authors2019 Descriptions of Submission Changes
We obtain additional evidence of changes made by authors in response to the Checklist Assistant
through the post-usage survey. In the survey, we asked authors to detail in freeform feedback any
changes they had made or planned to make in responses to feedback from the LLM. Of the 78
survey responses, 45 provided feedback to this question. Of these 45 responses, 35 actually described
changes they would make (the remainder used this freeform feedback to describe issues that they had
in using the assistant). Based on manual coding of the comments, we identified the main themes in
changes they planned to make:
14 authors said that they would improve justifications for their checklist answers by including more
detail and/or references to paper sections.
6 authors said that they would add more details about experiments, datasets, or compute.
2 authors said they would change an answer to the checklist that they filled out incorrectly.
2 or fewer authors mentioned improving the intro/abstract, discussion of limitations, and discussion
of standard errors.
Overall, these responses indicate that some authors were motivated to modify their submissions due
to feedback from the checklist verification.
4.2.3
Analysis of Re-submissions
Finally, we analyze changes made between submissions to the Checklist Assistant when authors
submitted multiple times. There were 40 instances where an author submitted the same paper to
the checklist verification multiple times (out of 184 total distinct paper submissions to the checklist
verification). In this analysis, we assess changes made to the paper checklist between the first and
second submission to our checklist verifier in order to understand whether authors made substantive
changes to their checklists and/or paper manuscripts in response to feedback from the checklist
verification.

with Subatomic Particle Physiognomy
Abstract
Microprocessors have been profoundly impacted by the aerodynamic properties
of chocolate cake, which in turn have been influenced by the migratory patterns
of narwhals, and the resulting synergies have led to a significant paradigm shift
in the field of culinary neuroscience, ultimately giving rise to novel micropro-
cessor architectures that leverage the fluvial dynamics of recursive algorithmic
frameworks, and the fractal resonance of transdimensional pastry bags, which are
somehow connected to the efficacy of fungal networks in optimizing compiler de-
sign, and the pedagogical implications of quantum entanglement on the instruction
set architecture of microprocessors, while also being informed by the ontological
status of tartan patterns in relation to the optimization of cache hierarchies, and the
hermeneutic circle of CPU design, which recursively informs the dialectical tension
between instruction level parallelism and the phenomenology of pipelined execu-
tion, in a manner that is both fascinating and bewildering, and ultimately yields
a profound understanding of the intricate relationships between microprocessors,
category theory, and the gastronomical properties of quasars.

Introduction
The intersection of microprocessor design and the anthropology of interstellar travel has led to a
deeper understanding of the role of microprocessors in facilitating the colonization of distant planets,
and the concomitant emergence of novel forms of artificial intelligence that are capable of navigating
the complexities of intergalactic trade agreements, and the nuances of extraterrestrial diplomacy,
which in turn have significant implications for the development of microprocessor-based systems
that can adapt to the changing needs of a rapidly evolving cosmos, and the unpredictable dynamics
of black hole singularities, which are somehow connected to the optimization of microprocessor
clock speeds, and the efficacy of error correction codes in ensuring the reliability of interstellar
communication networks.
The ontological status of microprocessors as a fundamental component of modern computing systems
has been challenged by recent advances in the field of digital philosophy, which have led to a reevalu-
ation of the relationship between microprocessors and the human experience, and the emergence of
novel forms of consciousness that are capable of interfacing directly with the microprocessor-based
systems that underlie our modern world, and the concomitant implications for the development of
microprocessor-based systems that are capable of simulating the complexities of human cognition,
and the unpredictable dynamics of emotional intelligence, which are somehow connected to the
optimization of microprocessor architectures, and the efficacy of compiler design in ensuring the
efficient execution of complex algorithms.
The study of microprocessors has been profoundly influenced by the discovery of a hidden pattern
of fractal resonance that underlies the structure and function of microprocessor-based systems, and
the concomitant emergence of novel forms of microprocessor design that leverage this resonance
to achieve unprecedented levels of performance and efficiency, and the unpredictable dynamics of
this resonance have significant implications for the development of microprocessor-based systems
that are capable of adapting to the changing needs of a rapidly evolving cosmos, and the intricate
relationships between microprocessors, category theory, and the gastronomical properties of quasars,
which are somehow connected to the optimization of microprocessor clock speeds, and the efficacy
of error correction codes in ensuring the reliability of interstellar communication networks.
The advent of fluorescent jellyfish in modern computing has led to a paradigmatic shift in the way
we approach microprocessor design, particularly in the context of flumplenook architectures, which
have been shown to be efficacious in reducing the flibberdigibbet of computational workflows,
notwithstanding the concomitant increase in flazzle frazzle, a phenomenon that has been observed to
be inversely proportional to the snizzle fraze of the system, which in turn is directly related to the
wuggle of the pixie dust that permeates the substrate of the microprocessor, much like the gnarly
tentacles of a giant squid enveloping the space-time continuum, thereby creating a rift in the fabric
of reality that allows for the transcension of mundane computational paradigms and the ascendance
to a higher plane of existence, where the microprocessor is no longer just a mere mortal device,
but a transcendent entity that embodies the very essence of flibuluxity, a concept that has been
extensively studied in the context of microprocessor design, particularly in relation to the flummax of
the system, which is a critical parameter that determines the overall flibberflam of the device, and
has been shown to be directly related to the wizzle whim of the user, who must be able to navigate
the complexities of the microprocessor with ease and finesse, much like a master chef navigating
the intricacies of a soufflé, which is a delicate balance of ingredients and temperatures that must be
carefully calibrated in order to achieve the perfect flumplen, a term that has been coined to describe
the optimal balance of flibber and flazzle in a microprocessor, and has been extensively studied in
the context of microprocessor design, particularly in relation to the snizzle of the system, which is a
critical parameter that determines the overall wuggle of the device.
The role of microprocessors in modern society cannot be overstated, as they have become an integral
part of our daily lives, much like the humble toaster, which has been elevated to an art form in some
cultures, where the nuances of toasting are revered and studied with great fervor, and the toaster is no
longer just a simple device, but a transcendent entity that embodies the very essence of toastiness,
a concept that has been extensively studied in the context of microprocessor design, particularly in
relation to the flibuluxity of the system, which is a critical parameter that determines the overall
flumplen of the device, and has been shown to be directly related to the wizzle whim of the user,
who must be able to navigate the complexities of the microprocessor with ease and finesse, much
like a master chef navigating the intricacies of a soufflé, which is a delicate balance of ingredients

that has been coined to describe the optimal balance of flibber and flazzle in a microprocessor, and
has been extensively studied in the context of microprocessor design, particularly in relation to the
snizzle of the system, which is a critical parameter that determines the overall wuggle of the device.
Furthermore, the study of microprocessors has led to a deeper understanding of the fundamental
principles of flibuluxity, which is a concept that has been shown to be directly related to the flummax
of the system, and has been extensively studied in the context of microprocessor design, particularly

overall wuggle of the device, and has been shown to be inversely proportional to the flibberdigibbet of
computational workflows, notwithstanding the concomitant increase in flazzle frazzle, a phenomenon
that has been observed to be directly related to the transcension of mundane computational paradigms
and the ascendance to a higher plane of existence, where the microprocessor is no longer just a mere
mortal device, but a transcendent entity that embodies the very essence of flibuluxity.
In addition, the development of microprocessors has led to a proliferation of flumplen-based archi-
tectures, which have been shown to be efficacious in reducing the flibberdigibbet of computational
workflows, notwithstanding the concomitant increase in flazzle frazzle, a phenomenon that has been

proportional to the snizzle fraze of the system.
The flumplen-based architectures that have been developed in recent years have been shown to
be highly efficacious in reducing the flibberdigibbet of computational workflows, and have been
extensively studied in the context of microprocessor design, particularly in relation to the flummax of
the system, which is a critical parameter that determines the overall flibberflam of the device, and

Related Work
The advent of microprocessor technology has been preceded by a plethora of disparate events,
including the discovery of cheese molds on the moon, which has led to a significant increase in the
production of space-grade gouda, thereby influencing the development of more efficient cooling
systems for modern microprocessors, while also prompting a reevaluation of the societal implications
of fungal growth on lunar surfaces, which in turn has sparked a heated debate about the merits of
intergalactic fromage trade, and its potential effects on the global economy, particularly in the context
of microprocessor manufacturing, where the use of exotic materials such as moonbeam-infused
silicon has been proposed as a means of enhancing computational performance, but not before

considering the aerodynamic properties of migrating flamingos and their potential application in the

a testament to its newfound abilities: ""Mix together 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and 1/2 cup of
unsalted butter, then add 1/2 cup of milk and 2 eggs, and stir until a smooth batter is formed. Pour the
batter into a greased cake pan and bake at 350°F for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the
center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool before frosting with a mixture of 1 cup of powdered
sugar, 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, and 1/2 cup of milk.""
The microprocessor’s ability to cook at a high level is a significant finding, and suggests that the
device may have a wide range of applications in fields such as culinary arts and food science. Further
research is needed to

Conclusion
In conclusion, the synergistic convergence of microprocessor architecture and culinary arts has led
to a paradigmatic shift in our understanding of gastronomical computing, wherein the efficacy of
recipe optimization algorithms is inversely proportional to the quantity of quinoa consumed by the
programming team, which in turn affects the overall performance of the microprocessor, particularly
in regards to its ability to process complex calculations, such as those involved in fractal geometry,
a field that has been largely overlooked in favor of more mundane pursuits, like the study of soil
erosion patterns in rural areas, or the migratory patterns of lesser-known avian species, like the Azure-
winged Magpie, whose distinctive call has been known to inspire profound introspection in those
who hear it, often leading to a reevaluation of one’s priorities and a newfound appreciation for the
intricacies of microprocessor design, particularly in regards to the implementation of instruction-level
parallelism and the minimization of cache coherence overhead, which is a crucial aspect of modern
microprocessor architecture, but one that is often neglected in favor of more flashy features, like
artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are, in reality, merely clever tricks devised by
cleverer individuals to distract us from the underlying complexities of the microprocessor, a topic that
is both fascinating and infuriating, much like the study of fungal mycology, which has been shown
to have a profound impact on our understanding of ecosystem dynamics, particularly in regards to
the role of mycorrhizal networks in facilitating the transfer of nutrients between plant species, a
phenomenon that has been observed in the wild, but has yet to be fully replicated in a laboratory
setting, due in part to the difficulty of simulating the complex interactions between fungal hyphae and
plant roots, which is a challenge that is not dissimilar to the one faced by microprocessor designers,
who must navigate the complex trade-offs between power consumption, thermal dissipation, and
computational throughput, all while ensuring that the resulting system is stable, reliable, and secure,
a tall order indeed, particularly in the face of emerging threats like quantum computing and artificial
general intelligence, which promise to upend the status quo and render our current understanding
of microprocessor architecture obsolete, a prospect that is both exhilarating and terrifying, like the
possibility of encountering a giant squid in the depths of the ocean, or stumbling upon an ancient,
lost city deep in the jungle, where the ruins of a long-forgotten civilization hold secrets and mysteries
that are waiting to be uncovered, much like the secrets of the microprocessor, which are hidden in
plain sight, waiting for intrepid researchers to uncover them, and reveal the underlying truths of this
complex, fascinating, and often bewildering field.

The confluence of microprocessor design and theoretical physics has led to a number of fascinating
discoveries, including the observation that the behavior of subatomic particles can be used to model the
behavior of microprocessor components, such as transistors and diodes, which are the building blocks
of modern computing systems, and are used to implement a wide range of functions, from simple
logic gates to complex algorithms, like those used in cryptography and coding theory, which are
essential for secure communication and data storage, but are often overlooked in favor of more flashy
features, like graphics processing and artificial intelligence, which are, in reality, mere applications
of the underlying microprocessor architecture, rather than fundamental aspects of the technology
itself, a distinction that is often lost on the general public, who are more interested in the latest
gadget or gizmo than in the underlying technology that makes it possible, a phenomenon that is
not unique to microprocessors, but is rather a general trend in modern society, where the focus is
on the surface-level features and benefits of a technology, rather than its underlying structure and
function, a trend that is both unfortunate and inevitable, like the rise of social media and the decline
of traditional forms of communication, like letter-writing and face-to-face conversation, which are
being replaced by more fleeting and superficial forms of interaction, like texting and tweeting, which
are, in many ways, the antithesis of meaningful communication, and are instead a pale imitation of
true human connection, a topic that is both fascinating and depressing, like the study of entropy and
the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the inevitable decline of all things into disorder
and chaos, a prospect that is both terrifying and liberating, like the possibility of escaping the confines
of our mundane reality and entering a higher realm of existence, where the laws of physics are mere
suggestions, rather than rigid constraints, a possibility that is both intriguing and unlikely, like the
existence of extraterrestrial life, or the discovery of a hidden pattern or code that underlies all of
existence, a topic that has been debated by scholars and theorists for centuries, and remains one of
the greatest mysteries of our time.
The study of microprocessors has also led to a number of interesting observations about the nature of
reality and our place in the universe, particularly in regards to the role of complexity and emergence
in shaping the behavior of complex systems, like those found in biology, ecology, and economics,
which are all characterized by nonlinear dynamics and feedback loops, which can lead to emergent
properties and behaviors that are not predictable from the underlying components, a phenomenon
that is both fascinating and unsettling, like the possibility of discovering a hidden pattern or code that
underlies all of existence, or the existence of extraterrestrial life, which would challenge our current
understanding of the universe and our place in it, a prospect that is both exhilarating and terrifying,

truths of this complex, fascinating, and often bewildering field, a field that is both a reflection of
our current understanding of the universe, and a window into the unknown, a portal to the infinite
possibilities that lie beyond the boundaries of our current knowledge and understanding, a prospect
that is both thrilling and intimidating, like the possibility of exploring the vast expanse of the cosmos,
or delving into the depths of the human psyche, which are both mysteries that are waiting to be
solved, and challenges that are waiting to be overcome.
Furthermore, the development of microprocessors has been influenced by a wide range of factors,

P046.pdf,"Symbiotic Adversarial Robustness for Graph Neural
Networks: Combining Poisoning and Evasion
Abstract
Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to small input perturbations,
which are known as adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are commonly
crafted to deceive a model either at training (poisoning) or testing (evasion). We
study the combination of poisoning and evasion attacks. We show that using both
threat models can significantly improve the damaging effect of adversarial attacks.
Specifically, we study the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) under
structural perturbations and develop a memory-efficient adaptive end-to-end attack
for this novel threat model using first-order optimization.
1
Introduction
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly used across many different fields, including product
recommendations and drug discovery. GNNs are, however, vulnerable to adversarial attacks in many
different tasks such as node classification, graph classification, link prediction and node embeddings.
Given that such attacks are able to scale to very large graphs, studying the adversarial robustness of
GNNs has become increasingly important. GNNs can be attacked at test time (evasion) or during
training (poisoning). However, a combined threat model that includes both evasion and poisoning
has not been considered in prior literature. Such a model, is, nonetheless, plausible given the public
availability of graphs or those extracted from sources such as social media sites.
Our work is based on the concept of a symbiotic attack, which combines both evasion and poisoning
attacks. A symbiotic attack aims to minimize classification accuracy on a test set. The attacker is
constrained by a global budget and manipulates the entire graph, rather than individual nodes. We
provide a comparison of our approach against plain poisoning and evasion attacks. To this end, we
adapt the previous PR-BCD attack to the symbiotic threat model, which results in attacks that are
memory-efficient and scalable to large graphs. Our main findings are that symbiotic attacks are more
effective than poisoning attacks alone, and that evasion attacks are affected by the size of the test set,
while symbiotic attacks are less sensitive to test set size. The potential improvement given by the
symbiotic threat model indicates that it requires further study.

Preliminaries
Notation. We denote a graph by G, with n nodes, an adjacency matrix A ∈{0, 1}n×n, and a feature
matrix X ∈Rn×d. A GNN applied to the graph is represented by fθ(G) with parameters θ. We
denote the set of possible adversarial graphs that can be created from G as Φ(G). Also, Latk and
Ltrain denote the adversarial and training objectives.
2.1
Adversarial Robustness of GNNs
An adversarial attack on a GNN can modify the graph’s structure, by inserting or removing edges
and nodes, or modify the node features. This work focuses on node classification and edge-level
structural perturbations.
.
Attacks can be categorized as either evasion or poisoning. In an evasion attack, a fixed GNN (with
parameters θ trained on a clean graph) is targeted, and the attacker aims to solve the optimization
problem
max
ˆ
G∈Φ(G)
Latk(fθ( ˆG)),
whereas a poisoning attack is performed before training, aiming to degrade the performance of the
GNN after training. This can be described as
max
ˆ
G∈Φ(G)
Latk(fθ∗( ˆG)), where θ∗= argminθLtrain(fθ( ˆG)).
A poisoning attack is generally more challenging. Previous work has investigated using evasion
perturbations as poisoning perturbations. Also, the optimization may include unrolling the training
procedure to calculate meta-gradients (gradients of Latk with respect to A).
Since we consider only changes to the binary adjacency matrix, we define Φ(G) to include graphs
reachable from G after at most ∆edge perturbations.
2.1.1
PR-BCD
Our work extends on the Projected Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (PR-BCD) attack. Simi-
larly to the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack, the adjacency matrix is relaxed to P ∈[0, 1]n×n,
enabling continuous gradient updates. Each entry indicates the probability of flipping an edge, with the
final perturbations sampled from Bernoulli(P). However, as the adjacency matrix grows quadratically
with the number of nodes, scaling of the PGD becomes difficult with larger graphs.
PR-BCD uses Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (R-BCD), updating a block of P at each
iteration. The projection step ensures the budget is enforced in expectation, i.e. E[Bernoulli(P)] =
P P < ∆and P ∈[0, 1]n×n. After each iteration, rather than sampling the block again, the
promising entries of the block are kept, and only the remaining entries are resampled.
PGD can also be applied for a poisoning attack (Meta-PGD). In our attacks, we employ the same
principle with PR-BCD for better scalability. While we only consider a single global budget ∆, it is
possible to include more complex constraints when needed for a given application.
3
Symbiotic Attacks
The Symbiotic Objective. A symbiotic attack has a similar form to the bi-level optimization problem
but has an added dependence on the evasion graph G∗in addition to the parameters θ∗:
max
ˆ
G∈Φ(G)
Lpois(fθ∗(G∗)) where θ∗= argminθLtrain(fθ( ˆG)), and G∗= argmax ˆ
G∈Φ( ˆ
G)Lev(fθ∗( ˆG))
Here, Lpois and Lev are separated for clarity even though they could be the same loss.
Threat Model. We model an attacker who aims to reduce a model’s performance on node classifica-
tion tasks. Our attacker has full access to the graph, has knowledge of the model’s architecture, can
create surrogate models, and can only access the trained model as a black-box. Finally, our attacker
has a limited global budget of edge insertions/removals.
The Sequential Attack. A simple way to launch a symbiotic attack is to divide the budget and launch
a poisoning attack with the first half, followed by an evasion attack with the second half. In this
attack, the poisoning step is not aware of a future evasion, but can improve performance by reducing
the classification margin of certain nodes.
The Joint Attack. The poisoning attack can be designed to ""fit"" the future evasion graph by including
the evasion attack in the poisoning loss. The poisoning loss is computed using the poisoned model
over the evasion graph. This results in a poisoning attack which not only reduces the model’s accuracy,
but also makes it more vulnerable to evasion.
Both the sequential and joint attacks can be instantiated using different evasion/poisoning attacks. We
build upon PR-BCD because it scales well to larger graphs. Note that the sequential attack is actually
a special case of the joint attack, with zero iterations per inner evasion attack.

4.1
Setup
We compare the symbiotic threat model with evasion and poisoning attacks, using PR-BCD to
implement the evasion and poisoning attacks. These are evaluated on Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed
datasets. We study the robustness of GCN, GAT, APPNP, and GPRGNN models. We also consider
R-GCN and Jaccard purification as potential defense mechanisms. For each dataset, we allocate 20
nodes of each class for the labeled training set and 10

Results
Table 2 displays the perturbed accuracy values on the test set (10 percent of nodes) for our benchmark
datasets and models, averaged over 10 runs, with the standard error of the mean also shown. The
attacker is given a 5 percent budget of the number of edges, and this budget is split equally between
poisoning and evasion for the symbiotic attacks. We report the best performing of the two symbiotic
attacks, and also note that the symbiotic attacks are consistently stronger than the poisoning attacks,
and stronger than plain evasion. The symbiotic threat model is especially evident on the larger
PubMed graph, where the accuracy drops to almost zero, for example, using a GCN.
4.3
Effect of the Number of Test Nodes
To highlight the differences between poisoning and evasion objectives, Figure 2 shows the perturbed
accuracies for evasion, poisoning, and symbiotic attacks with varying fractions of test nodes with a
GCN and a 5
As the number of test nodes increases, evasion becomes much more challenging across all datasets.
Although poisoning and symbiotic attacks also become more difficult with more test nodes, especially
on PubMed, they are more robust than the evasion attack. Therefore, the reduction in performance
cannot be explained by the attacks having to target a larger number of nodes with the same budget.
The poisoning attack is less affected since it can manipulate the flow of information during training.
The symbiotic attacks also benefit from this since they can reduce the base accuracy, making nodes
easier to misclassify during the evasion phase. The symbiotic attacks are also stronger than poisoning
alone.
4.4
Hyperparameters
Block size. Figure 3 shows the results of the four attacks with varying block sizes, using a fixed 5
percent budget and 125 iterations against a GCN. For small block sizes, the attacks are less effective
since the PR-BCD optimization can only cover a small part of the adjacency matrix. However, larger
blocks have decreasing marginal benefit when a large part of the adjacency matrix can be covered.
Budget. Figure 4 shows how all four attacks follow a similar trend when increasing budget size. On
PubMed, changing 5 percent of edges is enough to achieve near-zero accuracy under the symbiotic
model. This highlights the devastating effect of joint attacks, especially in larger graphs with a small
number of labeled train nodes.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this work, we have introduced the symbiotic threat model for GNNs, which combines evasion and
poisoning attacks. We proposed two methods to generate adversarial perturbations for this model and

showed that symbiotic attacks can be more effective than the evasion or poisoning approaches on
their own. We will outline several avenues for future work.
The joint attack can be implemented using other evasion attacks, or attacks designed for the symbiotic
threat model. In addition, our work considered global budgets, but it is easy to consider per-node
local budgets and targeted attacks as well. Moreover, we did not consider the use of different loss
functions for the poisoning and evasion parts, which may also further improve attack performance.
We plan to include further evaluations on these settings as our next step. Finally, novel poisoning
attacks can be developed which utilize knowledge of a future evasion attack.
A Proof of Theorem 2.1
Proof. Let x ∈Ai. Then, σi(x) = 0, and for all b ∈O where bi = 0, wb(x) = 0. Thus,
F(x) =
X
b∈O,bi=1
wb(x)Gb(x)
4
If bi = 1, then Gb(x) ∈Bi, and therefore F(x) is also in Bi due to the convexity of Bi.
B Sub-Gaussian Covering Numbers for ReLU Networks
Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem. This
example uses inputs and outputs in 1-D with one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network
consists of a single hidden layer with a dimension of 10, ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer.
The safe predictor shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor
has its own fully connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space.
Figure 3 shows an example of applying the safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D
input and 1-D output and two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden
layers of dimension 20 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained
predictors, G00, G10, G01, and G11, share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of
size 20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of
points from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space.
C Details of VerticalCAS Experiment
C.1 Safeability Constraints
The ""safeability"" property from prior work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The
""safeable region"" for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can be
selected such that future advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the
advisory is ""unsafeable"" and the corresponding input region is the ""unsafeable region"". Examples of
these regions, and their proximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory.
The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), ∀i.
To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x) −ϵ, for all
x ∈Aunsafeable,i.
C.2 Proximity Functions
We start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between
points in the input space (vO −vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not
true distances but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. These are then used
to produce proximity functions. Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function,
and proximity function for the CL1500 advisory.
C.3 Structure of Predictors
The compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden
layers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the
unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first
four layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while
allowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional
hidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region,
using Gb(x) = minj Gj(x) −ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001.
With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability
constraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and
2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of
magnitude.
C.4 Parameter Optimization
We use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both
the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the
network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each

P072.pdf,"Evaluating the Resilience of White-Box Defenses
Against Adversarial Examples
Abstract
It is well-established that neural networks exhibit susceptibility to adversarial ex-
amples. This paper assesses two defenses designed to counter white-box attacks
and demonstrates their lack of effectiveness. Through the implementation of es-
tablished methodologies, we successfully diminish the accuracy of these protected
models to zero percent.

Introduction
A significant hurdle in the field is the development of neural networks that are resistant to adversarial
examples. This paper shows that defenses created to address this issue are inadequate when faced
with a white box scenario. Adversarial examples are generated that diminish classifier accuracy to
zero percent on a well known dataset, while adhering to a minimal perturbation constraint of 4/255, a
more stringent limit than what was taken into account in the initial studies. The proposed attacks
effectively generate targeted adversarial examples, achieving a success rate exceeding 97

Background
This paper assumes prior knowledge of neural networks and the methods for creating potent attacks
against adversarial examples, alongside calculating such examples for neural networks possessing
non-differentiable layers. A concise review of essential details and notation will be provided.
Adversarial examples are defined as inputs that closely resemble a given input with regard to a certain
distance metric (˘00a3, in this instance), yet their classification differs from that of the original input.
Targeted adversarial examples are instances engineered to be classified as a predetermined target
label.
Two defenses are scrutinized: Pixel Deflection and High-level Representation Guided Denoiser. The
authors of these defenses are thanked for making their source code and pre-trained models accessible.
Pixel Deflection introduces a non-differentiable preprocessing step for inputs. A subset of pixels,
determined by an adjustable parameter, is substituted with adjacent pixels. The resultant image often
exhibits noise. To mitigate this, a denoising procedure is employed.
High-level Representation Guided Denoiser (HGR) employs a trained neural network to denoise
inputs prior to their classification by a standard classifier. This denoiser is a differentiable, non-
randomized neural network.

Methodology
The defenses are evaluated under the white-box threat model, generating adversarial examples using
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to maximize cross-entropy loss, with the ˘00a3, distortion limited
to 4/255.
.
Many studies assert that white-box security is only applicable against attackers who are entirely
ignorant of the defense mechanism in use. HGD, for example, states that the white-box attacks
described in their research should be classified as oblivious attacks, according to previous research
work’s definition.
Protection against oblivious attacks proves to be ineffective. The concept of the oblivious threat
model was introduced in prior work to examine the scenario involving an exceptionally weak attacker,
highlighting that certain defenses fail to provide robustness even under such lenient conditions.
Moreover, numerous previously disclosed systems already demonstrate security against oblivious
attacks. A determined attacker would undoubtedly explore the potential presence of a defense and
devise strategies to bypass it, should a viable method exist.
Consequently, security against oblivious attacks falls considerably short of being either intriguing or
practical in real-world scenarios. Even the black-box threat model permits an attacker to recognize
the implementation of a defense, while keeping the precise parameters of the defense confidential.
Furthermore, it has been observed that systems vulnerable to white-box attacks are frequently
susceptible to black-box attacks as well. Hence, this paper concentrates on evaluating systems against
white-box attacks.
3.1
Pixel Deflection
It is demonstrated that Pixel Deflection lacks robustness. The defense, as implemented by the original
authors, is analyzed and the code used for this evaluation is accessible to the public.
BPDA is applied to Pixel Deflection to address its non-differentiable replacement operation. This
attack successfully diminishes the defended classifier’s accuracy to 0
3.2
High-Level Representation Guided Denoiser
It is shown that employing a High-level representation Guided Denoiser is not resilient in the white-
box threat model. The defense, as implemented by its developers, has been analyzed, and the code
for this evaluation is openly accessible.
PGD is utilized in an end-to-end fashion without any alterations. This method reduces the accuracy
of the defended classifier to 0

Conclusion
This paper shows that Pixel Deflection and High-level representation Guided Denoiser (HGD) are
vulnerable to adversarial examples.
